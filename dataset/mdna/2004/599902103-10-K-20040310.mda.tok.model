also  words such as believe  anticipate  plan  expect  intend  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including  without limitation  those factors discussed in this annual report under the heading risk factors that may affect results 
overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing breakthrough products in the disease areas of cancer  cardiovascular disease and inflammatory disease 
we currently have a cancer product and a cardiovascular disease product on the market 
we also have other potential products in various stages of preclinical and clinical development in all three of our therapeutic disease areas of focus 
our strategy is to develop multiple products in three broad disease areas through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to be involved in the marketing and sale of many of these products 
we plan to develop and commercialize many of our products on our own  but will seek development and commercial collaborators when we believe that this will maximize product value 
for example  we plan to enter into sales and marketing alliances with major pharmaceutical companies for products in disease areas that require large sales forces or for markets outside of the united states 
our products velcade bortezomib for injection velcade  the first of a new class of medicines called proteasome inhibitors  is the first treatment in more than a decade to be approved in the united states for patients with multiple myeloma 
we received accelerated approval from the fda on may  to market velcade for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy 
in february  our marketing authorization application to market velcade in the european union for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on their most recent therapy was accepted for review by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea 
in january  the emea s committee on proprietary medicinal products  or cpmp  issued a positive opinion to recommend approval under exceptional circumstances for velcade 
the cpmp s opinion was forwarded to the european commission  and we anticipate that the european commission will ratify the opinion and issue a marketing authorization in the second quarter of under a marketing authorization  the emea would issue us a single license to market velcade in the member states of the european union  the ten other participating accession member countries  plus norway and iceland 
our ortho biotech collaboration on june   we entered into an agreement with ortho biotech products  lp  or ortho biotech  a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  to collaborate on the commercialization and continued clinical development of velcade 
under the terms of the agreement  we retain all commercialization rights to and profits from velcade in the united states 
subject to obtaining regulatory approvals of velcade outside of the united states  ortho biotech and its affiliate  janssen cilag  have agreed to commercialize velcade outside of the united states 
we are entitled to distribution fees from ortho biotech and its affiliates on sales of velcade outside of the united states 
we also retain an option to co promote velcade with ortho biotech at a future date in certain european countries 
under this agreement  we are engaged with ortho biotech in an extensive global program for further clinical development of velcade with the purpose of maximizing the clinical and commercial potential of velcade 
this program is investigating the potential of velcade to treat multiple forms of solid and hematological cancers  including continued clinical development of velcade for multiple myeloma 
ortho biotech is responsible for of the joint development costs through and for of those costs after in addition  we may receive payments from ortho biotech for achieving clinical development milestones  regulatory milestones outside of the united states or agreed upon sales levels of velcade 
integrilin eptifibatide injection in collaboration with schering plough corporation and schering plough ltd  together referred to as sgp  integrilin is marketed in the united states  in all member states of the european union and in other countries  including argentina  australia  brazil  canada  india  japan  mexico  singapore  south africa  switzerland and thailand 
in april  cor therapeutics  inc  or cor  entered into a collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
under this agreement  decisions regarding the ongoing development and marketing of integrilin are generally subject to the oversight of a joint steering committee with equal membership from sgp and us 
however  some development decisions are allocated specifically to us 
in addition  in those markets where sgp has exclusive marketing rights  currently everywhere except the united states  sgp has decision making authority with respect to marketing issues 
revenues historically  we have derived our revenue from our strategic research alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
with the february acquisition of cor  we began generating co promotion revenue based on sales of integrilin 
in may  we began recording product sales from velcade 
we expect that our revenue mix will continue to shift to product based revenue as we develop our product pipeline  commercialize additional products subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and enter into new commercial alliances  and our discovery focused alliances conclude 
velcade bortezomib for injection revenue we record sales of velcade in the united states  net of estimated product returns and discounts  as net product sales 
we record royalty and milestone payments  if any  when earned as royalty revenue and revenue under strategic alliances  respectively 
we record reimbursement of development costs by ortho biotech as revenue under strategic alliances in the period in which the related costs are incurred 
integrilin revenue in the first quarter of  we began recognizing co promotion revenue that principally relates to our share of the profits from the sale of integrilin by sgp in co promotion territories under our collaboration agreement with sgp to jointly develop and commercialize integrilin on a worldwide basis 
co promotion revenues also include recognition of reimbursement from sgp of our manufacturing related costs  advertising and promotional expenses associated with the sale of integrilin eptifibatide injection within co promotion territories and royalties from sgp on sales of integrilin outside of the co promotion territory 
revenue under strategic alliances we have entered into research  development  technology transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies relating to a broad range of therapeutic products 
these alliances provide us with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments  license fees and research funding  and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon our achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and or share profits if our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products 
these alliances are usually established for a fixed term  typically five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  unless renewed or earlier terminated  revenue funding under these agreements ceases 
we expect revenues from our discovery focused alliances to continue to decline as our existing alliances expire 
in addition to our collaboration agreements with ortho biotech and sgp  our major alliances from which we have recognized or may recognize revenues include a june joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc  or aventis  in inflammatory diseases  and a september research agreement with bayer ag  or bayer  in cardiovascular diseases  and specified areas of oncology  pain  hematology  atherosclerosis  thrombosis  urology and viral infections 
in april  aventis exercised its option effective july  to terminate a technology transfer agreement with us 
upon exercising this option  aventis paid us million in consideration of future use of technology transferred to aventis prior to the termination date 
termination of the technology transfer agreement has no effect on the existing five year joint development and commercialization agreement in inflammation 
we expect the joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis in the field of inflammatory disease to continue through june in october  the research phase of our five year alliance with bayer concluded 
bayer and millennium amended the agreement to provide both parties access to certain identified targets for a period of seven years 
if bayer successfully develops and commercializes any of these targets discovered in the alliance  bayer will owe us success and royalty payments on the sale of products generated from the alliance 
we have also entered into a number of arrangements for the commercialization of products under which we share the costs for the development and eventual commercialization of specified compounds and may receive or be obligated to make product revenue  royalty  milestone or other payments 
in addition to operating expenses we incur as a result of our alliances  we have also made commitments to purchase debt and equity securities of our collaborators under some of these arrangements 
these arrangements include a december in license and development agreement with xenova group  plc for novel compounds for the treatment of solid tumors in cancer  a november collaboration agreement with xoma ltd  pursuant to which xoma is developing a biotherapeutic agent in the cardiovascular disease area  and an april in license and development agreement with bzl biologics  llc for biotherapeutic products in the cancer area 
restructuring in december  we announced the first in a series of steps to realign our resources to become a commercially focused biopharmaceutical company 
we discontinued certain discovery research efforts  reduced headcount in our discovery group and began reallocating certain resources to enhance our commercial capabilities 
these actions resulted in the recognition of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of in june  we announced a broad  accelerated restructuring plan to focus our resources on development and commercialization 
the plan included consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction to approximately  employees by the end of and streamlining of the number of discovery and development projects 
these actions resulted in the recognition of million of restructuring charges for the year ended december   including the termination of approximately employees and the vacating of several of our facilities 
acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we consider merger and acquisition opportunities that may provide us with products on the market  products in later stage development or capabilities to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
cor on february   we acquired cor for an aggregate purchase price of billion through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and our consolidated financial statements include cor s operating results from the date of the acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated  based upon an independent valuation  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets acquired allocated to in process research and development  developed technology  trademark and goodwill 
the charge to earnings in the year ended december  for acquired in process research and development was million 
through the merger  we acquired integrilin eptifibatide injection and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular disease and oncology 
financial resources we have completed several financings in the past several years 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds include developing products  including conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing products that are approved for commercial sale  acquiring businesses and products that expand or complement our business  meeting our debt service obligations  and working capital 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we primarily invest in investment grade corporate bonds  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
our investment objectives are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
we expect that income from these investments will decline as our cash and marketable securities balances decline and will fluctuate based upon market conditions 
on april   we completed the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes due march   that are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share the notes and convertible senior notes due june   that are convertible into our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share the notes for an aggregate payment of approximately million  including principal  accrued interest and put premium 
approximately million of the notes and notes in the aggregate were not tendered in the offer and remain outstanding as of december  as a result of the repurchase  we recorded a net charge of approximately million which represents the write off of approximately million of unamortized original debt issuance costs associated with the notes and notes  offset by million relating to the expired put premium on the untendered notes 
in we received million from abbott laboratories  or abbott  for the final purchase of approximately million shares of our common stock under our equity investment agreement with abbott 
in we received million from abbott for purchases of approximately million shares our common stock under this agreement 
in we received million from abbott for purchases of approximately million shares our common stock under this agreement 
in  we received million from aventis for purchases of approximately million shares of our common stock under our equity investment agreement with aventis 
we are expanding our commercial operations through internal growth and by utilizing the capabilities of our alliance collaborators 
as our discovery focused alliances expire  we are increasingly focusing our efforts on entering into commercial alliances 
we expect to conserve financial resources through workforce planning  facilities consolidation and product portfolio management 
we expect to incur increasing expenses and are likely to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to our efforts to advance acquired products or our own development programs into commercialization 
in particular  we anticipate significant expenditures related to the continued development  product launch and commercialization of velcade bortezomib for injection for the treatment of other cancer types and increasing our development capabilities for our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
we expect to continue to pursue additional alliances and to consider joint development  merger  or acquisition opportunities that may provide us with access to products on the market or in later stages of commercial development 
our results of operations for any period may not be indicative of future results as our revenues and expenses may fluctuate from period to period or year to year 
reclassifications in connection with the launch of velcade for injection in may and the recognition of the related costs of sales  we reclassified certain integrilin eptifibatide injection related manufacturing expenses to cost of goods sold so that cost of goods sold now includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sales of integrilin and velcade 
these reclassified manufacturing related expenses were previously included in cost of co promotion revenue and certain integrilin related advertising and promotional expenses that were previously included in cost of co promotion revenue have been reclassified to selling  general and administrative expenses 
prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation 
there was no impact on net loss in any period 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  co promotion collaboration and strategic alliances 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize revenue from the sales of velcade bortezomib for injection in the us when delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the wholesalers 
allowances are recorded as a reduction to product sales for product returns and discounts at the time of sale 
the allowances are based primarily on historical trends in the pharmaceutical industry for similar products and discounts included in our agreements with wholesalers 
as we continue to develop company specific experience  our estimates are continually reviewed 
if actual future results vary  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have an impact on the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized 
we recognize co promotion revenue when sgp ships integrilin eptifibatide injection to wholesalers 
co promotion revenue includes our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin  reimbursements of our manufacturing related costs  advertising and promotional expenses and royalties from sgp on sales of integrilin outside of the co promotion territory 
we communicate with sgp to calculate our share of the profits from the sales of integrilin on a monthly basis 
the calculation includes estimates of the amount of advertising and promotional expenses and other costs incurred on a monthly basis 
we also communicate with sgp to estimate royalties earned on sales outside of the co promotion territory 
adjustments to our estimates are based upon actual information that we receive subsequent to our reporting deadlines 
our estimates are adjusted on a monthly basis and historically have not been significant due to periodic communication with our collaborator 
significant adjustments in future reporting periods could impact the timing and the amount of revenue to be recognized 
nonrefundable upfront licensing fees and certain guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of development  manufacturing or other commercialization efforts by us are recognized as strategic alliance revenue ratably over the development period if development risk is significant  ratably over the manufacturing period or estimated product useful life if development risk has been substantially eliminated  or based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research contract 
milestone payments are recognized as strategic alliance revenue when the performance obligations  as defined in the contract  are achieved 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiation of clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and approvals by regulatory agencies 
reimbursements of development costs are recognized as strategic alliance revenue as the related costs are incurred 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  management estimates the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we continually review these estimates which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and the amount of revenue recognized 
on october  the research phase of our alliance with bayer concluded 
we recognized the research funding portion of our bayer alliance on a percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion was determined based upon the actual level of work performed during the period as compared to our estimate of the total work to be performed under the alliance 
we continually reviewed these estimates and adjusted as necessary  as experience developed or new information became known 
in september  we revised the estimate of the total work to be performed downward as a result of productivity improvements 
no further adjustments were necessary and the accounting estimates used approximate actual efforts from september to the end of the research phase of the agreement 
inventory inventory consists of currently marketed products and from time to time product candidates awaiting regulatory approval which were capitalized based upon management s judgment of probable near term commercialization 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections or a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
at december  and december   inventory does not include any amounts for products that have not yet been approved for sale 
intangible assets we have acquired significant intangible assets that we value and record 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that are specifically identified and have alternative future uses are capitalized 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we engage independent valuation experts who review our critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  and reclassified amounts to goodwill  which were previously allocated to assembled workforce 
upon adoption  we ceased the amortization of goodwill 
we completed our transitional assessment of goodwill in the first quarter of and no impairment loss was recognized 
we test for goodwill impairment annually  on october on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date 
however  since the date of acquisition of cor  which generated a significant amount of goodwill  we have experienced a significant decline in market capitalization due to a decline in stock price 
we continually monitor business and market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists 
if we were to determine that an impairment indicator exists  we would be required to perform an impairment test which could result in a material impairment charge to our statement of operations 
accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf of the fasb issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf which addressed certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate accounting units if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into after june  we have not entered into any such arrangements since the effective date of eitf in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin and in december issued a revised fin fin r which addressed the period of adoption of fin for entities created before january  fin provides a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses 
the provisions of fin are effective for enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  we must adopt the provisions of fin in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for our interests in variable interest entities created before february  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december  and december  for the year ended december  the period  we reported a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net a loss of million  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  the period 
revenue increased to million for the period from million for the period 
net product sales of velcade bortezomib for injection  launched in may  were million in the period 
co promotion revenue  based on worldwide sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection  was million for the period compared to million for the period 
worldwide sales of integrilin in the period  as provided to us by sgp  were million  a increase over sales for the period 
this slight increase in sales reflects growth in integrilin market share in a flattening market 
revenue under strategic alliances decreased to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease in strategic alliance revenue primarily relates to the decrease in revenue recognized under our research alliance and technology transfer agreement with monsanto company  or monsanto  which expired in at the end of its original five year term and the conclusion of the research phase of the bayer alliance in the fourth quarter of the period 
this decrease is partially offset by approximately million of clinical milestones earned under our ortho biotech alliance and million of revenue recognized upon the april termination of the aventis technology transfer agreement 
included in period revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab there are no remaining amounts of revenue to be recognized that was included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
cost of goods sold includes manufacturing related expenses associated with the sale of integrilin and velcade 
the increase in cost of goods sold in the period is principally due to the commercial launch of velcade  as well as a full year of the cost of integrilin sales 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the period from million in the period 
this decrease reflects the financial benefits of our restructuring efforts  including reductions in discovery personnel and personnel related costs  as well decreased outside research and development services and consulting expenses 
the decrease is partially offset by increases in clinical trial costs for velcade 
in addition to our ongoing clinical trials of integrilin eptifibatide injection and velcade bortezomib for injection  we have ten drug candidates in clinical development 
the following chart summarizes the clinical trials of these ten drug candidates  the applicable disease indication and the current trial status of the program 
product description disease indication current trial status cancer mln is a targeting monoclonal antibody vehicle prostate cancer phase i phase ii mln is a novel dna targeting agent solid tumors phase i mln is a small molecule that selectively inhibits ft acute myeloid leukemia phase i mlnrl is a de immunized radio labeled murine monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the psma prostate specific membrane antigen prostate cancer phase i mln is a small molecule with dna targeting activity solid tumors phase i cardiovascular diseases mln is a recombinant protein that is designed to block both the c and c convertases patients undergoing cardiac surgeries phase i mln is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor stroke phase i inflammatory diseases mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against ccr chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis phase ii mln is a small molecule directed against ccr chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis phase i mln is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the greek alpha receptor crohn s disease ulcerative colitis phase ii phase ii completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the types of costs incurred during a clinical trial vary depending upon the type of product candidate and the nature of the study 
cmr international  an independent pharmaceutical data collection agency  estimates that clinical trials in our areas of focus are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase objective estimated completion period phase i establish safety in humans  study how the drug works  metabolizes and interacts with other drugs years phase ii evaluate efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety years phase iii confirm efficacy and safety of the product years upon successful completion of phase iii clinical trials of a product candidate  we intend to submit the results to the fda to support regulatory approval 
however  we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our clinical trials might prove that our product candidates may not be effective in treating the disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that require us to cease further development of the product candidate 
the cost to take a product candidate through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the disease indications  the timing  the size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
we could incur increased product development costs if we experience delays in clinical trial enrollment  delays in the evaluation of clinical trial results or delays in regulatory approvals 
products that are likely to result from our research and development projects are based on new technologies and new therapeutic approaches that have not been extensively tested in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these types of products may be more rigorous than for conventional products 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the nature and length of the efforts to complete such products as we may experience a longer regulatory process in connection with any products that we develop based upon these new technologies or therapeutic approaches 
in addition  ultimate approval for commercial manufacturing and marketing of our products is dependent on the fda or applicable approval body in the country for which approval is being sought  adding further uncertainty to estimated costs and completion dates 
significant delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
significant categories of costs include personnel  clinical  third party research and development services and laboratory supplies 
in addition  a significant portion of our research and development expenses is not tracked by project as it benefits multiple projects or our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not available 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our major research and development projects until a product candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase reflects the net impact of increased selling and marketing expenses related to the launch of velcade bortezomib for injection and the expansion of the millennium sgp sales force for integrilin eptifibatide injection offset by decreased consulting and legal expenses 
in june  we announced a broad  accelerated restructuring plan to focus our resources on development and commercialization 
the plan includes consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction and streamlining of discovery and development projects 
as a result  we have recorded restructuring charges of million in the period related to asset impairments  remaining rental obligations on facilities that we have vacated  personnel costs and contract termination 
charges related to facilities include the estimated remaining rental obligation  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities that we no longer occupy 
our decisions to vacate certain facilities and abandon the related leasehold improvements as well as terminate certain research programs were deemed to be impairment indicators under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  we recorded asset impairment charges to adjust the carrying value of the related long lived assets to fair value 
fair value of the assets was estimated based upon anticipated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
we anticipate additional restructuring charges in future periods as we complete the execution of our restructuring plan 
these charges will primarily include additional facilities and personnel 
we recorded a one time  non cash charge to operations in the period of million for acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that  at the time of the cor acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the in process technology we acquired from cor consisted of five significant research and development projects for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  as well as in the area of oncology 
during  we discontinued four of the five programs as part of our streamlining of discovery and development projects 
as of december   we expect to incur an additional million to million of research and development expenses for the remaining project  which we expect to complete by amortization of intangible assets in the period and period relates to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor acquisition as well as our acquisitions of leukosite in and cambridge discovery chemistry ltd  or cdc  in investment income decreased to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average balance of invested funds in the period as compared to the period and less favorable market conditions resulting in lower yields  coupled with a decrease in realized gains  as significant realized gains were recognized from our investment portfolio during the period 
interest expense decreased to million in the period from million in the period  primarily as a result of the april repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of the notes and notes 
through our acquisition of leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership  millennium and ilex partners  lp  or m i  for development of campath alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody 
we sold our equity interest in m i and in consideration for the sale  we received an initial payment of million in december during each of the and periods  we recorded an additional gain of million on our sale of this equity interest based upon the achievement of predetermined sales targets of campath for and that entitled us to this additional consideration under the terms of our agreement with ilex 
during the period  we recorded a non cash net charge of million which represents the write off of approximately million of unamortized original debt issuance costs associated with the notes and notes assumed in the cor acquisition  offset by million relating to the expired put premium on the untendered notes as of april  during the period  we recorded a non cash charge of million relating to the fair value of the put premium placed on the notes and notes 
years ended december  and december  amounts relating to the year ended december  the period do not include financial results for cor  which we acquired on february  for the period  we had a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share for the period 
revenue increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase in revenue primarily relates to the recognition of million of co promotion revenue in the period from worldwide sales of integrilin eptifibatide injection 
worldwide sales of integrilin in the period  as provided to us by sgp  were million  a increase over primarily as result of increased volume and also from price increases 
revenue under strategic alliances decreased from million in the period to million in the period 
strategic alliance revenue decreased due to reduced research efforts in our bayer alliance and termination of certain of our early strategic alliances  including our american home products alliance for the treatment and prevention of disorders of the central nervous system 
included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the research and development expense categories with the most significant increases were personnel costs  followed by clinical trial costs and facilities expenses 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in building a sustainable product pipeline  with increases in clinical costs related to advancing our lead oncology program  velcade bortezomib for injection  and clinical investments made in integrilin 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the cor commercial infrastructure that was not present in the period as well as increased expenses due to the expansion of our business groups  facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the development of our pipeline and growth in all areas of our business 
significant increases were primarily in personnel expenses  followed by consulting and facilities expenses 
in december  we announced the first in a series of steps we will take to realign our resources to those of a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company 
we have discontinued certain discovery efforts  reduced related headcount and will reallocate certain resources to enhance our commercial capabilities 
as a result  we have recorded a restructuring charge of million in the period related to termination benefits  which include severance  out placement services and other associated costs 
cost of goods sold was million for the period and consists of certain manufacturing related expenses associated with the sale of integrilin within co promotion territories 
we recorded a one time  non cash charge to operations in the period of million for acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that  at the time of the cor acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the income approach was used to establish the fair values of developed technology  trademark and acquired in process research and development 
this approach establishes the fair value of an asset by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate with the time value of money and investment risk factors 
accordingly  for the purpose of establishing the fair value of developed technology  trademark and acquired in process research and development  revenues for each future period were estimated  along with costs  expenses  taxes and other charges 
revenue estimates were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
a major risk associated with the timely completion and commercialization of these products is the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data of long term clinical trials 
if these projects are not successfully developed  future results of operations may be adversely affected 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
we believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangibles and in process research and development were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project revenues  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
amortization of intangible assets in the period relates to specifically identified intangible assets from the cor  leukosite and cdc acquisitions 
amortization of intangible assets in the period relates to existing technology  assembled workforce and goodwill acquired through the acquisitions of leukosite and cdc 
amortization expense decreased to million in the period from million in the period due to the adoption of sfas no 
following our adoption of sfas no 
effective as of january   we continue to amortize specifically identifiable intangible assets and ceased amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce which was reclassified to goodwill 
investment income increased to million in the period from million in the period 
the increase primarily relates to realized gains recognized from sales of marketable securities of million in the period  offset by an increase in realized losses of million 
because we realized significant gains from our investment portfolio during  we expect realized gains on the sales of marketable securities to decrease in future periods 
interest expense increased to million in the period from million in the period 
the change relates to increased interest due to the assumption of million of principal of the notes and notes 
we also recognized a non cash charge of million in the period relating to the fair value of the premium put placed on these notes 
in the period  we sold our equity interest in m i for million and contingent consideration based on future sales of campath in the united states  million of which we received in the period 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and to pay debt service  including principal and interest and capital lease payments 
we have also made strategic commitments to purchase debt and equity securities from some of our alliance collaborators in accordance with our board of directors approved policies and our business needs 
these investment commitments are generally in smaller companies 
we may lose money in these investments and our ability to liquidate these investments is in some cases very limited 
we may also owe our partners milestone payments and royalties 
we have committed to fund development costs incurred by some of our partners 
see contractual obligations for the further discussion 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following our co promotion relationship with sgp for the sale of integrilin eptifibatide injection  payments from our strategic collaborators  including equity investments  license fees  milestone payments and research funding  equity and debt financings in the public markets  property and equipment financings  and net cash acquired in connection with acquisitions 
in the future  we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from some of these external sources as well as from sales of velcade bortezomib for injection  integrilin and other products  subject to regulatory approval 
we are entitled to additional committed research and development funding under certain of our strategic alliances 
we believe the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash are revenues and margins from sales of velcade  integrilin and other products and services for which we may obtain marketing approval in the future  the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biopharmaceutical companies  our ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations and to maintain existing and new collaborations and the success of such collaborations  and the sales levels of campath and other products that may be sold in the future by companies that may owe us royalty  milestone or other payments on account of such products 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this excludes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet as of december   which serve as collateral for letters of credit securing leased facilities 
cash flows we used million of cash in operating activities in the period and million in the period 
the principal use of cash in operating activities in both and was to fund our net loss 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors including changes in accounts receivable and deferred revenues related to our existing and new arrangements with collaborators  as well as changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the average collection period of our accounts receivable can vary and is dependent on various factors  including the type of revenue and the payment terms related to those revenues and whether the related revenue was recorded at the beginning or at the end of a period 
we used million of cash in investing activities in the period 
investing activities provided cash of billion in the period  which was reinvested into our securities portfolio during the period 
the principal uses of funds in the period and period were purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment 
the decrease of approximately million in purchases of property and equipment is primarily attributable to less equipment purchased in the period  as a result of the consolidation of research and development facilities  overall headcount reduction and streamlining of discovery and development projects 
the principal source of funds in the period is from the sale of marketable securities and the cash acquired in the cor acquisition 
in the period  we used million of cash in financing activities 
the primary use of cash was the repurchase of million in principal of convertible notes and the related put premium of million 
financing activities provided net cash of million in the period 
in the and periods  the principal sources of net cash from financing activities were the sales of common stock to abbott and millennium employees 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and the anticipated cash payments from our current strategic alliances will be sufficient to support our expected operations  fund our debt service and capital lease obligations and fund our capital commitments for at least the next several years 
contractual obligations our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our facilities leases  convertible notes  capital leases from equipment financings and commitments to purchase debt and equity securities from certain collaborators 
as of december   our convertible notes aggregated million in principal amount outstanding 
all three issues of notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
all required interest payments have been made to date 
as of december   these notes consisted of million of our notes  million of our notes  and million of our notes 
we also have lease obligations relating to two new buildings for laboratory and office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the rent obligation for the first of these buildings began in july and the rent on the second building began in july rent is calculated on an escalating scale ranging from approximately million  per building per year  to approximately million  per building per year 
each lease is for a term of seventeen years 
we were responsible for a portion of the construction costs for both buildings and were deemed to be the owner during the construction period of each building under eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
as a result  during the period  we recorded approximately million and during the period  we recorded approximately million of additional non cash construction costs under these leases 
upon completion of the construction period of each of the buildings  we recorded the leases as capital leases 
below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years long term debt obligations  including interest payments  capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     long term supply contracts   external collaborations    total      as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion to offset future federal taxable income expiring in through and billion to offset future state taxable income expiring in through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate realization of tax benefits created from such prior losses  no benefit has been recognized in the financial statements as of december  we would allocate any subsequently recognized tax benefits to operations  goodwill and additional paid in capital 
moreover  our ability to utilize these losses in future years may be limited under the change of stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our fixed income investment portfolio in accordance with our policy for securities investments  or investment policy  that has been approved by our board of directors 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs  and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
investments are made primarily in investment grade corporate bonds with effective maturities of three years or less  asset backed debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are subject to risk of default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december   the fair value of our notes  notes and notes approximates their carrying value 
the interest rates on our convertible notes and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
we have no derivative instruments outstanding as of december  as of december  we did not have any financing arrangements that were not reflected in our balance sheet
