item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed in item of this report under the section entitled safe harbor statements under the private securities litigation reform act of results of operations overview during the fiscal year ended january  fiscal the company s diluted earnings per share increased to  which was in the upper end of our planned range 
our strong results helped us to achieve an after tax return on average shareholders equity of 
we achieved this performance  despite below plan growth in both same store and total sales  by growing our pre tax profit margin the ratio of pre tax income to sales 
the pre tax profit margin increase was achieved primarily through improvement to our merchandise margins  the result of effective inventory management and merchandising strategies 
pre tax profit margin also benefited from disciplined expense management and was favorably impacted by the rd week in the fiscal calendar 
we continued to grow our business  opening new stores net of closings and  excluding the acquisition of bob s stores  increasing our store count to  bob s stores  a value oriented chain of stores located in the northeast united states  was acquired in december  as a platform for future growth 
strong cash flows from operations allowed us to fund our capital expenditure requirements and the bob s stores acquisition  while continuing our stock buyback program 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at a cost of million  which contributed to earnings per share growth 
our ability to continue to report annual earnings per share growth will be driven by revenue growth from our new store openings along with increases in same store sales  maintaining steady profit margins  and the benefit from our share repurchase program 
the execution of our buying strategies and disciplined inventory management  leading to rapid inventory turns  are key factors to our continued success 
the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level 
this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment 
all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated 
all earnings per share calculations and per share data have been adjusted to give effect for the two for one stock split distributed on may  net sales net sales for tjx for our fiscal year ended january   totaled billion  an increase over sales of billion for our fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
the net sales for fiscal represented an increase over sales of billion for our fiscal year ended january  fiscal 
our reporting period for fiscal included weeks compared to weeks in both fiscal and the rd week in fiscal increased net sales by an estimated over fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal includes approximately from new stores  from same store sales growth  with the balance primarily due to the rd week 
each of these factors includes the favorable effect of changes in the currency exchange rates of our winners and tk maxx operations 
same store sales in fiscal benefited approximately percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates 
the growth in net sales for the year was less than we had planned  primarily due to lower than expected same store sales 
the increase in net sales of in fiscal includes approximately from new stores and from same store sales growth 
foreign currency exchange rate changes also favorably impacted fiscal sales growth but to a much lesser extent than the impact in fiscal new stores are our major source of sales growth 
our consolidated store count  excluding bob s stores  increased by in fiscal and in fiscal over the respective prior year period 
our selling square footage  excluding bob s stores  increased by in fiscal and by in fiscal  in each case over the prior year 
our acquisition of bob s stores on december   added units as of the end of 
table of contents fiscal net sales for bob s stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition  although the impact on sales growth was not significant 
consolidated same store sales growth of in fiscal including foreign currency benefit was less than planned  largely due to the effect of unseasonable weather in the first half of the year 
the sales results for fiscal reflected strong demand for home fashions and were achieved despite a weak economy  geopolitical concerns and a highly promotional retail environment 
same store sales growth in both years was favorably affected by our younger divisions as their share of consolidated results continues to increase 
we expect to add stores net of store closings in fiscal  an increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 
we have planned a to increase in same store sales and a increase in total sales for fiscal we estimate that approximately to of this sales growth will come from favorable currency exchange rates 
we plan on adding or expanding certain departments in many of our stores to help drive our same store sales growth 
these initiatives are discussed in more detail below 
we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years  or in other words  stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation 
we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria 
we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year  unless a store is closed 
we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned 
relocated stores and expanded stores are generally classified in the same way as the original store 
we believe that the impact of relocated or expanded stores on the same store percentage is immaterial 
consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars 
we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions  because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january weeks net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense  net income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this ratio in fiscal was better than our plan and reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin  primarily in the second half of fiscal the improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate 
reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio 
successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement 
the improvement in this ratio in fiscal was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lower than planned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs  as a result of opening our new tj maxx distribution facility in pittston  pennsylvania 
store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 
for fiscal over last year and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 
the cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the rd week in the fiscal reporting period as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs 
the benefit from the 
table of contents rd week in fiscal  which we estimate to be a 
improvement in this ratio  is reflected in the results discussed above 
the improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal is largely due to the improvement in merchandise margin at winners  homegoods and tk maxx due to reduced markdowns resulting from improved inventory liquidity 
these improvements in fiscal offset an increase in this ratio of approximately 
at marmaxx 
in fiscal  marmaxx experienced higher distribution costs  store occupancy costs and insurance and employee benefit costs as a percentage of net sales 
marmaxx was also impacted in fiscal by a less than planned sales performance 
we anticipate the cost of sales ratio in fiscal will be similar to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal and fiscal and in fiscal overall  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat compared to fiscal and in line with our plan 
store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal as a result of the levering impact of less than planned sales  but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal due to a million litigation charge 
the litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four california lawsuits that alleged tjx had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from california overtime laws 
the lawsuits were settled and paid in fiscal for slightly less than million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal increased by approximately 
due to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and increases in store payroll attributable to lower employee turnover 
the charge for the california lawsuits in fiscal increased selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 
we anticipate this expense ratio to increase in fiscal by 
to 
compared to fiscal this anticipated increase is largely due to the impact of the planned expansion of certain departments at many of our stores as well as increased costs for medical and retirement benefits 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in interest income in fiscal was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 
the reduction in interest income in fiscal was due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in gross interest expense in fiscal is due to the inclusion in fiscal s interest expense of amortization of debt expenses relating to the zero coupon convertible notes issued in february see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect net interest expense to increase slightly in fiscal income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal reflects increases in state income taxes compared to fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal includes the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of split dollar arrangements as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
this improvement in the effective tax rate was completely offset by the effect of increases in state income tax rates in fiscal the slight increase in the effective rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the impact of a one time benefit in foreign taxes in fiscal based on our operating plans for fiscal and an anticipated increase in state income taxes  we are planning a tax rate for fiscal of 
income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal income from continuing operations per share was in fiscal  versus 
table of contents in fiscal and 
in fiscal net income for fiscal includes an after tax charge of million  or 
per share  due to discontinued operations for contingent lease obligations associated with househome  inc as described in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
net income  after reflecting the above item  was million  or per share  in fiscal  million  or per share  in fiscal and million  or 
per share  in fiscal we estimate that the rd week in fiscal added 
to our earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal added approximately 
to our earnings per share 
the increase in earnings per share  on a percentage basis  in all periods increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program 
we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal with planned spending of million 
segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments 
we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss  which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense  goodwill amortization prior to fiscal and interest 
segment profit or loss  as defined by tjx  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
in addition  this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
more detailed information about our segments  including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements 
marmaxx fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase decrease in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands marmaxx had a same store sales decrease in fiscal  which was below our plan and also below last year s increase 
despite a below plan sales performance  marmaxx segment profit margin was above plan as a result of sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense control 
with an expanded distribution capacity  marmaxx was able to make closer to need buys in fiscal  leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin  especially in the second half of the year 
the marmaxx segment profit margin was also favorably impacted in fiscal by the rd week  as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs 
we estimate this impact to be 
marmaxx segment profit improvement in fiscal also reflects the effect of higher costs in fiscal due to the million litigation charge 
this charge also reduced segment profit margin by 
in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  marmaxx maintained a liquid inventory position throughout the year  a key factor in this division s maintaining its merchandise margin in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall reduction in segment profit margin for fiscal reflected increases in insurance and employee benefits  which accounted for a 
drop in the segment profit margin 
lower than planned sales and increased store payroll costs  due in part to lower attrition  also reduced the segment profit margin in fiscal new stores for marmaxx in both fiscal and performed above expectations 
we added a net of new stores in fiscal and increased total selling square footage by 
we expect to open a net of new stores in fiscal  increasing the marmaxx store base by 
we expect to increase our selling square footage by 

table of contents winners and homesense fiscal year ended january us dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales us currency local currency stores in operation at end of period winners homesense selling square footage at end of period in thousands winners homesense same store sales in local currency for winners and homesense increased by in fiscal  slightly less than planned  on top of a increase in the prior year 
new stores for winners and homesense performed above expectations in both fiscal and fiscal segment profit increased in fiscal versus a increase in fiscal  and was slightly above our plan due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
we estimate that approximately two thirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal over fiscal was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
winners and homesense segment profit margin for fiscal was below plan and last year 
the reduction in segment profit margin as compared to fiscal reflects increased markdowns at winners and the increasing impact of homesense on their combined results 
homesense is at an earlier stage of development and operates with higher expense ratios than does winners 
in fiscal  results were driven by a significant improvement in merchandise margin as a result of better inventory management as well as improved merchandise flow and mix throughout the year 
homesense net sales were of this group s total net sales in fiscal and of total net sales in fiscal we added winners stores and homesense stores in fiscal  and expanded selling square footage in canada by 
in fiscal  winners also opened its first superstore which combines a winners store with a homesense store 
we expect to open winners and homesense stores in fiscal  including seven superstores  increasing our total canadian store base by  and increasing selling square footage by 
tk maxx fiscal year ended january us dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales us currency local currency stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands tk maxx  operating in the united kingdom and ireland  recorded sales and segment profit that exceeded plan 
same store sales increased in local currency in fiscal  on top of a increase in the 
table of contents prior year 
new stores for fiscal performed above our expectations 
segment profit increased in fiscal  and we estimate that approximately one quarter of the growth in segment profit during fiscal resulted from changes in currency exchange rates 
the strong segment performance in fiscal was driven by tk maxx s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies 
in fiscal  segment profit increased  as we saw a significant increase in merchandise margin driven by improvements in inventory management 
the growth in segment profit for fiscal was also favorably impacted by changes in currency exchange rates  which accounted for approximately of the increase in segment profit 
we added new tk maxx stores in fiscal  and increased selling square footage by 
the actual store openings were six fewer than we originally planned  but our increased use of mezzanine selling floors added selling square footage during fiscal and helped offset the fewer store openings 
with mezzanine space  we increase our selling space with little additional rental costs  thus increasing store productivity 
we plan to open an additional tk maxx stores in fiscal  and expand selling square footage by 
homegoods fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands homegoods same store sales grew in fiscal  less than planned  compared to a increase in the prior year 
segment profit increased by in fiscal to million  and was above our plan  despite less than planned sales performance 
the better than plan segment profit reflects homegoods continued solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies  and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as the business grows 
new stores in both fiscal years performed above expectations 
in fiscal  segment profit margins were up significantly as we saw improvements in merchandising  inventory management  store operations and distribution 
we opened a net of homegoods stores in fiscal  a increase  and increased selling square footage by 
in fiscal  we plan on adding a net of new homegoods stores and increasing selling square footage by 
aj wright fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit loss percent increase in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands aj wright sales were up in fiscal to million  due to an increase in same store sales and new stores 
in fiscal  although same store sales were slightly below our plan  total net sales were above plan  reflecting the strong performance of new stores 
aj wright achieved a segment profit of million in fiscal  which was well ahead of plan and up significantly compared to a segment loss of million in fiscal the improvement in aj wright s segment profit is primarily the impact of 
table of contents improved merchandising and strong inventory management leading to improved merchandise margins 
segment profit for fiscal also includes a million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property 
in fiscal  aj wright s segment loss was impacted  in part  by the unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter in areas of the country where aj wright has a large concentration of stores 
aj wright s aggressive store opening program for fiscal also placed strains on this young division and resulted in some execution issues  which negatively impacted the bottom line in fiscal we added new aj wright stores in fiscal  increasing selling square footage by 
in fiscal  we plan to add new stores and increase selling square footage by 
bob s stores on december  we completed the acquisition of bob s stores  a value oriented casual  family apparel retailer operating stores 
the results of bob s stores are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition 
during fiscal  bob s stores contributed million to net sales and generated a segment loss of million 
we currently operate bob s stores and expect to open additional stores in fiscal we plan to evaluate and further develop this concept before initiating significant expansion plans 
we do not anticipate bob s stores having a significant impact on tjx s earnings over the next several years 
general corporate expense fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks general corporate expense general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments 
this item includes the costs of the corporate office  including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management  payroll and operating costs of the non divisional departments for accounting and budgeting  internal audit  treasury  investor relations  tax  risk management  legal  human resources and systems  and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff 
in addition  general corporate expense includes the benefit costs of existing retirees and non operating costs and unusual gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions 
general corporate expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of contributions to the tjx foundation of million in fiscal in fiscal  there were no contributions to the tjx foundation 
this increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity 
fiscal includes approximately million in income due to net foreign exchange gains and losses as compared to approximately million in net charges in fiscal the majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity 
we have not elected hedge accounting for these contracts  thus  the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings 
as of the end of fiscal  the unrealized fair value of derivative contracts outstanding has been allocated to the related segments 
the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal to fiscal reflects increased costs for retirement and medical benefits of approximately million  as well as a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the transaction terminating split dollar life insurance policies for two senior executives as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
this pre tax charge was offset by tax benefits of million in the income tax provision 
fiscal also includes approximately million in net charges due to foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity as compared to a net gain of less than million in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the cash generated from operating activities each fiscal period is largely due to strong operating earnings 
the decline in net cash provided from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of an increase in our inventory net of related increase in accounts payable at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal inventories per store at january  were up compared to the prior year  and inventories per store at january  were down compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  inventories per store at january  increased over the prior year 
this increase in inventory was attributable in part to our plan to raise the level of store inventories over fiscal levels 
the timing of inventory receipts  in part due to the rd week  also contributed to the higher inventory levels at january  the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal were also impacted by a lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal as compared to fiscal the lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflects reduced accruals for property additions at the end of fiscal and the payment of the california lawsuits in fiscal the significant cash generated from operating activities in fiscal and fiscal is largely due to strong operating earnings along with our liquid inventory position and our buying closer to need 
cash flows for fiscal also reflect the favorable impact of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the increase in accrued expenses for fiscal reflects the reserve for the settlement of the california lawsuits  and higher accruals for property additions  payroll and benefits  merchandise credits and occupancy costs 
operating cash flows for fiscal and fiscal were favorably impacted by additional deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and due to increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for us income tax purposes 
the cash flows from operating activities have been reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal and fiscal  and million of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal  were made on a voluntary basis 
cash flows from operating activities were also reduced by million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  for cash expenditures charged against the discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below 
discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of the former househome and zayre stores  for which tjx is an original lessee or guarantor 
these discontinued operations are being liquidated in bankruptcy by third parties 
the reserve activity in prior years also reflects leases of hit or miss  another discontinued operation that liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party 
the reserve was established at various times subsequent to tjx s disposition of these businesses  when the companies then owning them suffered significant financial distress 
when discontinued operations were sold to third parties  tjx generally remained secondarily liable with respect to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform  unless there are circumstances that terminate or reduce tjx s potential liability 
the reserve reflects tjx s estimation of its cost for claims that have been  or are likely to be  made against tjx based on potential secondary liability after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations 
mitigating factors include assignments to third parties  lease terminations  expirations  subleases  buyouts  modifications and other actions  legal defenses and use by tjx for its store opening program 
at january   substantially all of the househome  zayre stores and hit or miss leases that were rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved as a result of negotiated buyouts  assignments to third parties  leasing for tjx s own use or for sublease and lease expirations 
it is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired  but tjx does not expect any such costs to be material 

table of contents the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below 
the addition to the reserve in fiscal relates to househome 
the charges against the reserve during fiscal relate primarily to househome and zayre stores lease obligations  during fiscal  the charges relate primarily to househome lease obligations  and during fiscal  the charges relate primarily to former zayre stores and hit or miss locations 
fiscal year ended january in thousands balance at beginning of year additions to the reserve charges against the reserve lease related obligations all other balance at end of year we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve 
in addition  we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the househome bankruptcy  although the amount has not yet been determined 
we may also be contingently liable on up to leases of bj s wholesale club for which bj s wholesale club is primarily liable 
our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases  because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj s wholesale club 
off balance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on any property we have leased or guaranteed and assigned to third parties without being released by the landlords 
over many years  we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties 
with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements  we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned or guaranteed leases  and accordingly  we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them 
we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate 
we estimate the undiscounted obligations  not reflected in our reserves  of leases of closed stores of continuing operations discussed in note k to the consolidated financial statements  bj s wholesale club leases discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements  and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet  if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations  is approximately million as of january  we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and  to the extent they do  will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 
we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold  specified environmental matters or certain income taxes 
these obligations are typically limited in time and amount 
there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

table of contents investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below fiscal year ended january in millions new stores store renovations and improvements office and distribution centers capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal were less than planned primarily due to lower than planned spending on office facilities and information systems 
we expect that capital expenditures will approximate million for fiscal this includes million for new stores  million for store renovations and improvements and million for our office and distribution centers 
our planned rate of new store growth per year is in the to range on a consolidated basis for the next several years 
our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores  are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures 
investing activities for fiscal include a net cash outflow of million to acquire bob s stores as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities for fiscal include million of cash outlays due to advances we made under a construction loan agreement  in connection with the expansion of our leased home office facility 
we received repayments under this loan agreement of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the majority of this activity relates to our share repurchase program and our long term borrowings 
we spent million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal under our stock repurchase programs 
we repurchased million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal all shares repurchased are retired with the exception of  shares purchased in fiscal and  shares purchased in fiscal all of which are held in treasury 
during july  we completed a billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional billion of common stock over several years 
since the inception of the new billion stock repurchase program  as of january   we have repurchased million shares at a total cost of million 
all of these repurchased share numbers reflect the two for one stock split distributed in may on february   we issued million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in february and raised gross proceeds of million 
the issue price of the notes represented a yield to maturity of per year 
the notes are convertible into million shares of common stock of tjx if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds  if the credit rating of the notes is below investment grade  if the notes are called for redemption  or if certain specified corporate transactions occur 
none of these conditions existed as of january   january  or january  and thus the shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations 
the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes in february and february we may pay the purchase price in cash  our stock  or a combination of the two 
if the holders exercise this option  we expect to fund the payment with cash  financing from our short term credit facility  new long term borrowings  or a combination thereof 
at the earlier put date of february  no holders exercised the purchase option  and more recently on february   only  in face value of bonds was put to tjx which were settled in cash 
we used the proceeds for our accelerated store roll out program  investment in our distribution center network  general 
table of contents corporate purposes and our common stock repurchase program 
financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on long term debt of million in fiscal  and  in fiscal we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 
per share in fiscal  
per share in fiscal  and 
per share in fiscal cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal financing activities also include proceeds of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal from the exercise of employee stock options 
these stock option exercises also provided tax benefits of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal these benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities 
we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations  short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper 
during fiscal  we entered into a million five year revolving credit facility and in fiscal we renewed our day revolving credit facility for million 
effective march   the day agreement was renewed  with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged 
the credit facilities do not require any compensating balances  however tjx must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
based on our current financial condition  we believe that the possibility of non compliance with these covenants is remote 
the revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program 
as of january   there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities 
the maximum amount of our us short term borrowings outstanding was million during fiscal and million during fiscal there were no short term borrowings during fiscal the weighted average interest rate on our us short term borrowings was in fiscal and in fiscal as of january   we had credit lines totaling c million for our canadian subsidiary 
the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line was c million in fiscal  c million in fiscal and c million in fiscal the funding requirements of our canadian operations were largely provided by tjx 
we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs 
see notes c and g to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our long term debt  capital stock transactions and available financing sources 
contractual obligations as of january   we have payments due including current installments under long term debt arrangements  leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands payments due by year less more than than total year years years years long term contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease commitments capital lease obligations purchase obligations the above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal the note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted  the notes will mature in fiscal 
table of contents our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise  purchase orders for capital expenditures  supplies and other operating needs  commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services  and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements 
we excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 
we also have long term liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates 
included in long term liabilities is million for employee compensation and benefits  most of which will come due beyond five years and million for our rental step up accrual  the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 
our long term liabilities also include our discontinued operations reserve of million 
we expect a large portion of this reserve will be paid in the next five years as settlements are reached  while a smaller portion will extend beyond five years for those reserve obligations tied to the remaining lease term 
critical accounting policies we have the obligation to evaluate and select applicable accounting policies for tjx 
we consider our most critical accounting policies  involving management estimates and judgments  to be those relating to inventory valuation  retirement obligations  accounting for taxes and reserves for discontinued operations 
we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained  had alternative assumptions been selected  would not be materially different from the results we have reported 
inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis 
under the retail method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage 
a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns 
under the first in first out retail method  permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed 
we believe the first in first out retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods 
in addition  as a normal business practice  we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken  greatly reducing the need for management estimates 
inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods  but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end 
thus  the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
overall  we believe that the retail method  coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end  results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
lastly  many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the value of the inventory 
our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors 
bob s stores  the value oriented retailer we acquired in december  does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met 
these arrangements will likely have some impact on bob s stores inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results for fiscal over time  we have found that actual results involving inventory valuation issues have not varied significantly from our estimates 
retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent an obligation that will ultimately be settled far in the future and is therefore subject to estimates 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets  both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period 
the discount rate  which we determine annually based on market interest rates  has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal have been considerably less than our expected returns 
these two situations have resulted in a considerable increase in the annual cost of retirement benefits and have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan 
we have made contributions of million  which exceeded the minimum required  over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 
in addition  
table of contents during fiscal  we reduced the assumption for the long term rate of return on pension plan assets to from which increased net pension expense for fiscal by approximately million 
accounting for taxes we are continuously under audit by the united states federal  state  local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
the internal revenue service is currently examining the fiscal years ended january through january and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 
reserves for discontinued operations as discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management s discussion and analysis  we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by tjx where tjx was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties 
these are long term obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease  how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors  including indemnification  may exist 
we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location 
actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur
