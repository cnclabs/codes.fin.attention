historical results and percentage relationships  including trends which might appear  set forth in the consolidated statements of income contained in the consolidated financial statements  should not be taken as indicative of future operating results 
the company s real estate investment portfolio is composed of sixteen retail properties and sixteen apartment communities  two of which are currently under construction 
in july  the company added approximately  sf of additional retail space  acquiring the florida shores plaza shopping center in edgewater  florida 
as of december   the company s gross investment in real estate totaled million and consisted of approximately  or million  in retail properties and approximately  or million  in apartment communities 
total revenue for  was million  and consisted of approximately  or million  generated by the retail properties  and approximately  or million  generated by the apartment communities 
on may   the company completed an exchange offer for its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due july  old debentures 
as a result of the exchange offer  the company accepted tenders from holders of a total of  in aggregate principal amount of the old debentures  to exchange into  of the company s convertible subordinated debentures due july   and  shares of the company s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at per share 
on may   the company closed the sale of  in principal amount of its convertible subordinated debentures due july   and  shares of its series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at per share 
after completion of the exchange and cash offerings  the entire  principal amount of the old debentures had been retired 
the company now has outstanding  principal amount of its convertible subordinated debentures due july  and  shares of its series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation price of per share plus accumulated dividends 
the most significant change to the company s financial and asset structure in related to its apartment communities 
the company continued construction on two new apartment developments in governors gate ii in pensacola  florida and greenbrier estates in slidell  louisiana a total of units 
at year end  units had been completed 
in addition  the company undertook extensive interior and exterior remodeling and landscaping of three apartment communities in mobile  alabama  with the goal of making them more competitive in the mobile rental market and increasing their occupancy rates 
because these apartments are occupied  interior remodeling of the dwelling units have occurred and will occur as the units become vacant  which results in holding each vacant unit off the rental market during remodeling and extending the final completion date for the total program 
the costs related with the new construction and renovations resulted in increased borrowings under the company s lines of credit during the year 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and operating revenue totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million  earned a year ago 
operating revenue was positively affected by contributions from florida shores plaza shopping center  purchased in july  and the two apartment complexes under construction which were partially complete at december   partially offset by lower apartment revenue as a result of lower occupancies during the year 
operating expenses were million in  compared to million in the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the addition of the three properties in  increased utilities  insurance costs  real estate taxes and repair and maintenance costs 
general and administrative costs increased approximately  for the year due primarily to increased payroll  legal and professional fees  insurance and maintenance costs 
interest expense for the twelve months ended december  decreased  compared to last year  due primarily to higher capitalized interest costs and lower interest rates  partially offset by higher balances on the company s lines of credit 
during the year  the company capitalized million in interest costs  as compared to  in the prior year 
the average credit line interest rate was for the twelve months ended december   compared to in the prior year 
for the year ended december   net income was million  compared to million in the prior year 
net income available to common shareholders was  for the year  compared to million in the prior year 
comparison of the years ended december  and operating revenue totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million  on a same store basis  earned a year ago 
operating revenue for the years ended december  and are not comparable due to the sale of a property during july of operating revenue for was million 
operating revenue for retail shopping centers and apartment communities was million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue was due to higher occupancy levels in the retail portfolio 
same store operating expenses were million in  compared to million in  after excluding the effects of certain expenses related to a fourth quarter property management company acquisition 
this increase in operating expenses was due  in particular  to higher property insurance costs and real estate taxes 
interest expense decreased million from the prior year 
interest expense was reduced after the company s issuance of marketable equity securities in the fourth quarter of  the proceeds of which were used to reduce the company s floating rate bank debt 
the average bank borrowings in were approximately million  with an average interest rate of  as compared to million  with an average rate of in liquidity and capital resources the sources of working capital for the company on both a short term and long term basis are provided by operating activities  from which the company funds normal operating requirements  periodic dividends to investors and capital expenditure requirements  supplemented by mortgage financings of properties in its portfolio 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the company maintains unsecured credit lines with commercial banks  which it utilizes to temporarily finance the cost of portfolio growth  property improvements  and other expenditures 
these bank lines of credit total million of which approximately million was available at december  utilization of the bank lines is subject to certain restrictive covenants that impose maximum borrowing levels by the company through the maintenance of prescribed financial ratios minimum net worth  adding back depreciation must exceed million debt to equity must not exceed of equity dividends to funds from operations must not exceed of funds from operations unencumbered assets to committed bank lines must exceed of committed bank lines interest coverage funds from operations plus interest expense must exceed of interest expense net operating income from unencumbered assets to the funded portion of committed bank lines must exceed of funded bank lines funds from operations from unencumbered assets to interest expense on funded unsecured debt must exceed of interest expense on funded unsecured debt from time to time  the company has obtained waivers of covenants when necessary 
at december   there were no unresolved issues regarding these covenants 
the company believes that the sources discussed above will be adequate to fund its capital requirements for the next twelve months and thereafter 
net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million in from the decrease between and is primarily attributable to decreased net income  and the timing of the payment of property insurance premiums 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased million in from  primarily attributable to increased development activities  most notable  the construction of the governors gate ii and greenbrier estates apartment complexes 
in july  the company purchased florida shores plaza shopping center in edgewater  florida 
during the year ended december   the company capitalized million in interest costs related to these and other developments 
net cash flows provided by financing activities increased million in from  primarily due to the following activities i an increase of million in borrowing proceeds from notes payable to banks in  ii a decrease of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan  stock option redemptions and stock award plans  iii an increase of mortgage proceeds net of increased escrow deposits of million  iv decreased proceeds of  due to the debenture and preferred stock offering net of related costs in and v increased cash dividends to common and preferred shareholders of  as of december   the company had mortgage debt of million 
all of these mortgages are non recourse and bear a fixed rate of interest for a fixed term 
the company has a interest in a partnership which owns the southwood shopping center located in gretna  louisiana 
this property is subject to a mortgage for which the other owner is liable 
sixteen of the operating properties in the portfolio are currently unencumbered by mortgage debt 
the company anticipates that its current cash balance  operating and investing cash flows  and borrowings including borrowings under its lines of credit will be adequate to fund the company s future i operating and administrative expenses  ii debt service obligations  iii distributions to common and preferred shareholders  iv capital improvements on existing properties  v development of new properties  and vi normal repair and maintenance costs at its properties 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations for each of the subsequent five years in thousands s thereafter total fixed rate mortgages convertible subordinated debentures construction contractual obligations the company currently has two long term ground lease obligations at westland shopping center and southwood shopping center 
the westland lease requires the company to pay annually of the total rent collected  and expires on december  the company contractually paid ground rent of  in   in and  in the southwood lease requires the company to pay annually of cash flow after debt service and certain other adjustments  and expires on march  the company paid ground rent of  in   in and in holders of the company s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock are entitled to receive  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends  preferential cumulative cash dividends at the rate of per annum of the liquidation preference per share equivalent to a fixed annual amount of per share 
dividends on the series b preferred stock will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of february  may  august and november of each year  or  if not a business day  the next succeeding business day 
the board of directors  on february   declared a per share cash dividend  payable on may   to shareholders of record on april  the company s current common stock dividend policy is to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders  based upon funds from operations  among other factors  as opposed to net income 
because funds from operations excludes the deduction of non cash charges  principally depreciation of real estate assets  quarterly dividends will typically be greater than net income and may include a tax deferred return of capital component 
the board of directors  on february   declared a cash dividend with respect to the period october  through december  of per share  to shareholders of record as of february  funds from operations the company defines funds from operations ffo as net income  computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  those items defined as extraordinary under gaap  plus depreciation on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
ffo is a key operating measure used by our management team in evaluating operating performance  and trends in operating performance 
our management also uses ffo to compare our operating performance with other equity reits  particularly those who own retail and residential properties 
we also consider ffo  as well as other criteria  in evaluating and granting incentive compensation to our management employees 
we believe that ffo may also be helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in computing ffo  we exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate 
in our view  these amounts  which are derived from historical cost  are of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
our experience  and the experience of other owners of shopping centers and apartment communities in the markets in which we operate  is that depreciation and amortization has virtually no correlation with changes in the value of the properties 
real estate assets can also appreciate  rather than depreciate in value over time 
our management believes  however that ffo  by excluding such items  which can vary among owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
our ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in a comparable manner or may use different interpretations in the calculation 
we believe that use of ffo may also facilitate comparisons of operating performance between operating periods under comparisons and among us and other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and other appropriate operating measures and cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities when trying to understand an equity reit s operating performance 
ffo is not a gaap measure or a disclosure required by the securities and exchange commission 
computations of ffo differ among reits 
thus  an investor should be attentive to differences in ffo computations when comparing ffo among reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
a reconciliation of net income to basic ffo is presented below in thousands year ended december dollars shares dollars shares net income additions depreciation and amortization partnership depreciation deductions minority depreciation preferred dividends amortization costs funds from operations available to common shareholders for the year ended december   ffo available to common stock decreased approximately million to million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to increased real estate taxes  property insurance costs  utilities and general and administrative expenses  as well as the payout of preferred dividends  partially offset by increased revenues and decreased interest expense 
for the year ended december  ffo available to common shareholders decreased approximately  to million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to increased real estate taxes and property insurance costs  as well as the payout of preferred dividends  partially offset by decreased interest expense 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
certain of our operating leases for retail space contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified target amount  or breakpoint  as additional rent 
we defer recognition of percentage rent until those specified targets are met 
real estate investments 
we apply financial accounting standards board statement statement to measure impairment in long lived assets 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors on occupancy 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
the company has no impaired properties 
accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in variable interest entities vies by march  the adoption of fin r should have no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  as the company does not have variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments 
one type is mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets 
a second type  which includes put options and forward purchase contracts  involves instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets 
the third type of instrument that is a liability under this statement is an obligation that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
sfas no 
does not apply to features embedded in a financial instrument that is not a derivative in its entirety 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends fas no 
 the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of fas no 
to stock based employee compensation 
the pro forma data presented below is not representative of the effects on reported amounts for future years 
as reported proforma results net income available to common shareholder net income per common share no new options were granted in for grants in and  the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes pricing model based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate expected life years years years volatility dividend yield future results this form k and other documents prepared and statements made by the company  may contain certain forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainty 
investors and potential investors in the company s securities are cautioned that a number of factors could adversely affect the company and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including  but not limited to a the inability to lease current or future vacant space in the company s properties  b decisions by tenants and anchor tenants who own their space to close stores at the company s properties  c the inability of tenants to pay rent and other expenses  d tenant financial difficulties  e general economic and world conditions  including threats to the united states homeland from unfriendly factions  f decreases in rental rates available from tenants  g increases in operating costs at the company s properties  h increases in corporate operating costs associated with new regulatory requirements  i lack of availability of financing for acquisition  development and rehabilitation of properties by the company  j force majeure as it relates to construction and rehabilitation projects  k possible dispositions of mature properties since the company is continuously engaged in the examination of its various lines of business  l increases in interest rates  m a general economic downturn resulting in lower retail sales and causing downward pressure on occupancies and rents at retail properties  as well as n the adverse tax consequences if the company were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 
except as required under federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we do not have any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements in this form k  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions or otherwise 
effects of inflation inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties 
substantially all of the company s retail leases contain provisions designed to provide the company with a hedge against inflation 
most of the company s retail leases contain provisions which enable the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenant sales in excess of a stated breakpoint and or provide for periodic increases in minimum rent during the lease term 
the majority of the company s retail leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions 
in addition  most retail leases require tenants to pay a contribution towards property operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s exposure to higher operating costs caused by inflation 
the company s apartment leases are written for short terms  generally six to twelve months  and are adjusted according to changing market conditions 
these factors reduce the company s exposure to increased cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its bank lines of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures  operations and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to optimize its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objective  the company utilizes its variable libor based  short term one to six month maturities bank credit lines to fund the development and acquisition of new investments until such investments can be financed with long term fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt 
at december   borrowings under the company s bank lines of credit totaled million and bore an average interest rate of 
the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value because they are short term and therefore utilize interest rates which are adjusted to market at maturity 
based on the balance of bank lines of credit outstanding at december  and the average interest rate at year end  each basis point increase in variable interest rates would increase the company s interest expense in by approximately  conversely  each basis point decrease in variable interest rates would decrease the company s interest expense in by a like amount 
as the bank lines of credit are obligations that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during such future period and the level of interest rates at that time 
at december   the company had mortgage debt totaling million with an average interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate of this debt will be in and  in  in and in the following table summarizes the company s obligations under long term debt for each of the subsequent five years in thousands s thereafter total fixed rate mortgages convertible subordinated debentures fair value weighted average interest rate fixed rate mortgages convertible subordinated debentures
