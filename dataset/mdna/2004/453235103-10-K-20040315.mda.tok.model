our primary markets are very competitive and subject to substantial government regulation 
pricing and market share pressures vary by product line and geographic market 
in general  inflationary trends result in increases in our labor and material costs 
in addition  there are foreign currency fluctuations and other risks associated with operating on a global basis  such as price and currency exchange controls  import restrictions  and changing economic  social and political conditions in foreign countries 
we expect these trends and risks to continue 
we will continue to manage these issues by capitalizing on our market presence  developing innovative products  investing in human resources  consolidating manufacturing facilities  leveraging our cost structure  and possibly entering into alliances and other arrangements 
we will also seek opportunities where appropriate to limit any potential unfavorable impacts of operating in countries with weakened economic conditions 
we derive all of our revenues from product sales 
we sell our breast aesthetics  facial aesthetics and obesity intervention products in the us canada to hospitals  clinics and doctors through a direct sales force

we manufacture our products in california  costa rica and ireland 
we also purchase finished products and certain raw material components from third party manufacturers 
the cost of goods sold represents the cost of third party finished products  raw materials  labor and overhead 
gross margins may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in the selling prices of our products  the mix of products sold  changes in the cost of third party finished products  raw materials  labor and overhead and manufacturing efficiencies or inefficiencies 
in  the cost of goods sold also includes accelerated depreciation charges related to the manufacturing consolidation see note to the consolidated financial statements

our development pipeline of products currently includes products that have commenced or will soon commence clinical development in the us these products include silicone gel filled breast implants  hylaform dermal fillers  botulinum toxin type a product  and  juvederm dermal fillers 
for a further discussion on the status of us and international regulatory approvals  see part i item business on our annual report on form k liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million from million at december  at december   approximately million of our cash was held internationally and may be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the us the increase during was the result of cash provided by operations of million and cash from the issuance of common stock of million offset primarily by net principal repayments of notes payable and long term debt of million and the purchase of plant and equipment of million 
cash provided by operating activities has been  and is expected to continue to be  our primary source of funds 
cash provided by operations of million in reflects net income of million that was adjusted by non cash charges including million of depreciation and amortization and an million tax benefit from stock option exercises  as well as the effect of an increase in trade accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other assets of million  and other changes in assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operations in of million reflects net income of million that was adjusted by non cash charges  including million of depreciation and amortization  special charges of million and other non cash items  as well as the effect of an increase in trade accounts receivable of million  an increase in accruals and other long term liabilities of million  and other changes in assets and liabilities 
cash used in investing activities of million in and million in consisted primarily of capital expenditures for our global erp system and capacity expansion projects 
we anticipate spending between and million in on capital projects  primarily for production expansion at our fremont and arklow facilities 
cash used in financing activities in of million reflected net principal payments of million on our long term debt  which were partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding employee stock options 
on july   we retired our existing term loan facility with a balance of million and obtained a new credit facility having a principal balance of million for a term of five years and also entered into a new revolving credit facility of million 
the borrowings under the new credit facilities bear interest at the london interbank offered rate or libor plus that will decrease to libor plus at march  cash used in financing activities in of million reflected principal payments of million on our long term debt  including million of principal prepayments which were partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and employee stock options 
as of december  our credit agreement allows us to use up to million of its funds to pay dividends and purchase our common stock 
we had no stock repurchase program in place as of december  as of december   we had long term debt of million 
annual principal payments of   and million are due in through  each year  respectively 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit 
as of december   we have used million of the revolver capacity by having one of the banks issue letters of credit in favor of several insurance companies  the purpose of which is to collateralize liability insurance programs 
the remaining million of revolver capacity is unused as of december  the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations distribution agreements other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total total other long term liabilities is million 
the million includes million of the short term portion of the long term obligation 
the primary objectives for our cash investments are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are generally of short duration and high credit quality 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing debt financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
further  we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient replacement financing  which coupled with our operating cash flow  will be in an amount sufficient to repay the existing term loan 
however  we may raise additional debt or equity capital from time to time

percent of sales percent of sales percent of sales dollar change percent change dollar change percent change inamed aesthetics breast inamed aesthetics facial inamed heatlh obesity intervention other products total net sales net of returns  discounts  and allowances  or sales  for were effected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively by approximately in  in and negatively by in we expect sales to grow at a low double digit rate in inamed aesthetics breast 
the growth in and of breast aesthetic sales was driven by several key factors acceptance of all aesthetics procedures has grown including breast augmentation and reconstruction 
favorable demographics continue to emerge in the us and internationally 
the introduction of new products and extensions of product lines better address the needs of the market 
some of these products were introduced in the second half of in the united states  we have seen a continued acceptance of the style smooth round saline matrix implants and the style and style smooth round silicone gel filled implants used in connection with the adjunct clinical study for breast reconstruction 
internationally  our expanded offering of the cohesive silicone gel matrix product line and the new soft touch cohesive silicone gel matrix has helped strengthen our position and growth 
in  sales of breast aesthetics products are expected to grow at a mid double digit rate 
inamed aesthetics facial 
facial aesthetics sales for experienced positive growth in the us the reasons for continued market and product growth spans several areas a focused marketing and advertising plan coupled with targeted execution by our sales representatives on our customer base has played a key role in establishing our position around our new human collagen products  cosmoderm and cosmoplast 
in march  we received approval from the fda to market our human collagen based dermal fillers  cosmoderm and cosmoplast  in the us these products are derived from natural human collagen and do not require a pre procedure skin test 
these attributes are driving much of the increase in us sales 
acceptance of all aesthetics procedures has grown  including facial aesthetics procedures 
this increase has largely been driven by the continuing strong performance of allergan s botulinum toxin a  botox  and the continuing increase in the number of dermotologic techniques used 
in the us  favorable growth in the key demographic has strongly contributed to market and product expansion 
facial aesthetics sales for experienced strong growth in the us which we attribute to the increasing acceptance of cosmetic procedures  the demographic expansion of the market segment that most uses anti wrinkle products  the introduction and continued acceptance of allergan s botox into the us market  focused execution by our sales representatives and improved management of average selling prices 
our overall international facial sales were down in sales growth in europe was positive  but our sales performance declined in japan more than offsetting the european growth 
in  sales of facial aesthetics products are expected to decrease slightly from due to the introduction of restylane in the united states in the first quarter of inamed health obesity intervention 
the increase in and sales was primarily due to the following the continued and increased acceptance of the bioenterics lap band system in the us the significant growth of sales in the us of the bioenterics lap band system in and can be attributed to a dedication to our formal lap band system training programs and thus an increase in the number of trained and proctored surgeons  enhanced focus on practice building on key accounts  expanded reimbursement coverage and a continued dedication to expanded consumer awareness of the procedure both nationally and regionally  the obesity epidemic has been well documented in the press and will be a serious and prevalent health care issue for the foreseeable future 
in  sales of obesity intervention products are expected to increase in the range over sales in we expect to achieve this growth by training and qualifying more physicians on the procedure  working to achieve broader reimbursement for the product and the procedure and educating consumers about the benefits of the bioenterics lap band system versus other medical procedures 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold percent of sales gross profit margin percent change over prior year the improvement of gross margins in and reflected the emergence of a more balanced product portfolio and improved operational efficiencies 
included in cost of goods sold for and was million and million of accelerated depreciation respectively relating to the manufacturing consolidation 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we expect cost of goods sold to be to and the gross profit margin to be to of sales  including the impact of accelerated depreciation from the manufacturing consolidation  which we estimate to be million 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a percent of sales dollar change over prior year percent change over prior year in much of the increase in sg a expenses was to support the launch of cosmoderm and cosmoplast with focus on consumer awareness  and royalties associated with the sales of our aesthetic products 
also included in sg a was a million charge related to a legal dispute with sager et al 
involving alleged misleading advertising that originated in the mid s and a specific increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for million related to our italian facial business which had been operated through a sales agency arrangement that we terminated subsequent to year end 
in our selling and marketing expenses increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales 
our general and administrative expense decreased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of sales 
in much of the increase in sg a was due to the increased promotion of the bioenterics lap band system and continued promotion of our aesthetics products 
there were also increases in insurance costs and legal fees associated with various legal matters as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have also specifically included million of charges and credits related to litigation  million for investment impairments  for sales tax liability adjustments  and credits for other items 
in our selling and marketing expenses increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of sales 
our general and administrative expense increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of sales 
in  we expect sg a expenses to be in the range of to of sales  as we continue to invest in key business initiatives 
these include several product launches in the breast and facial aesthetics businesses 
research and development r d r d percent of sales dollar change over prior year percent change over prior year the majority of the expenses in related to the clinical development programs for our hylaform dermal filler  the botulinum toxin type a product  and the silicone gel and cohesive silicone gel breast implant clinical trial  and pma applications as applicable in the us the increase in over was due primarily to an increase in development expense funding for silicone gel filled breast implants  hylaform dermal filler and the botulinum toxin type a clinical trial 
in  we expect research and development expenses will increase to million over and be in the range of to million 
the increase in investment in r d is essential to advance our strategic and market positions in our three main product lines around the world 
restructuring charges in we recorded million of restructuring costs 
this restructuring was undertaken to consolidate manufacturing facilities 
the manufacturing consolidation will lead to improved efficiencies and cost savings 
the consolidation will continue through and involves transitioning santa barbara based manufacturing to our facilities in costa rica and ireland 
in  we eliminated approximately positions in santa barbara and approximately will be eliminated in the first half of the majority of the costs relate to severance which will be paid from the beginning of through as part of the manufacturing consolidation we have accelerated the depreciation on certain assets with shortened useful lives 
for the years ending december  and we incurred and million of accelerated depreciation charges included in cost of goods sold on the income statement 
we expect additional accelerated depreciation charges related to this manufacturing consolidation of approximately million in in  we recorded million of restructuring charges to reflect costs associated with changing senior management and consolidating facilities and administrative functions 
the santa barbara reduction was facilitated by moving certain manufacturing operations to our new facility in costa rica  which began full operation late in  and the move of santa barbara s remaining manufacturing to a local facility 
these costs were primarily employee severance costs 
we do not expect any further material costs related to the restructuring 
amortization in amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation was million compared to million in and million in  a decrease of million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to one patent becoming fully amortized in august the decrease in was due to the adoption of fas  under which goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
interest expense net interest and other financing expense totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we had a decrease of million  or  in and no change in the decrease is due to lower interest rates and significantly lower debt levels  offset by additional charges each year for the recognition of unamortized loan fees and the realization of unrealized losses on our interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing and prepayment of our debt 
foreign currency foreign currency gains and losses fluctuate based largely upon the fluctuation of the dollar to the eu euro and the japanese yen 
royalty income and other royalty income  net of other expenses  was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was   and  for   and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in was due to increased economic activity in low tax jurisdictions and several non recurring items  including the recognition of additional foreign net operating loss carryforwards  the write off of the tax basis of certain foreign subsidiaries and the favorable resolution of several tax issues 
the decrease in was related to the recognition of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards  the utilization of miscellaneous tax credits  us charges related to our manufacturing consolidation and other finance charges  all non recurring items 
in addition  our tax rate benefited from a lower state effective tax rate and increased economic activity in low tax jurisdictions 
in  we expect our effective tax rate to be in a range of to 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and warranties 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of sales discounts  returns and allowances  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
these statements establish that revenue can be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of product to third party distributors and customers 
due to the widespread holding of consignment inventory in our industry  we also recognize revenue when the products are withdrawn from consignment inventory in hospitals  clinics and doctors offices 
appropriate reserves are established for anticipated returns and allowances based on our product return history 
we believe our estimates for anticipated returns is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate returns and  if actual returns vary  it could have a material impact on our reported sales and results of operations 
historically our estimates of return rates have not fluctuated from the actual returns by more than to 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain product candidates prior to regulatory approval  based on our judgment of probable future commercialization 
we believe our estimates of inventory values is a critical accounting estimate because we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the product candidate by the necessary regulatory bodies  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on the analysis of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic trends  any deterioration of the accounts receivable aging  and changes in customer payment terms 
we believe our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we account for long lived assets  other than goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
and certain sections of apb opinion no 
specific to discontinued operations 
sfas no 
classifies long lived assets as either to be held and used  to be disposed of by other than sale  or to be disposed of by sale 
this standard introduces a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach to deal with situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
we have adopted this statement  which has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity review its long lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
with the exception of the manufacturing consolidation that occurred in  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements  attached as exhibit a  we do not believe that any such changes have taken place 
we also adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  as a result  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subject to a transitional impairment analysis and is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates related to the fair values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated and is usually based on projected cash flows or market value approach 
other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  of which periods of up to years 
we believe the estimate of our valuation of long lived assets and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because if circumstances arose that led to a decrease in the valuation it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
income taxes deferred income tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the statutory marginal income tax rate in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the deferred income tax assets or liabilities from period to period 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our ability to carryback losses  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
we believe the estimate of our income tax assets  liabilities and expense are critical accounting estimates because if the actual income tax assets  liabilities and expenses differ from our estimates the outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations 
litigation we are involved in various litigation matters as a claimant and as a defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection occurs 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel  and management 
product warranties we have an accrual for our confidence plus warranty program for our breast implant sales in the united states 
we estimate the amount of potential future claims from this warranty based on actuarial analysis 
expected future obligations are determined based on the history of product shipments and claims and are discounted to a current value 
we believe that our estimate for product warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it requires us to estimate failure rates  claim amounts  and discount rates 
changes to actual claims and interest rates could have a material impact on the actuarial calculation which could materially impact our reported expenses and results of operations 
recent pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies either that do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or in which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
in december  the fasb completed deliberations of proposed modifications to fin revised interpretations resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the vie 
vies created after january   but prior to january   may be accounted for either based on the original interpretation or the revised interpretations 
vies created after january   must be accounted for under the revised interpretations 
special purpose entities spes created prior to february  may be accounted for under the original or revised interpretation s provisions 
non spes created prior to february   should be accounted for under the revised interpretation s provisions 
the revised interpretations are effective for periods after june  for vies in which the company holds a variable interest it acquired before february  for entities acquired or created before february   the revised interpretations are effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march   except for those vies that are considered to be spes  for which the effective date is no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  the adoption of fin and the revised interpretations has not and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results from operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after september  and for hedging relationships designated after september  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results from operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  were accounted for as equity 
sfas no 
affects the issuer s accounting for three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatory redeemable shares  which the issuer is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets  put options and forward purchase contracts that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  and  obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results from operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which codifies  revises  and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary its cost of financing and operations 
interest rate exposure based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   which was variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
foreign currency exposure our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the movement of the us dollar relative to the euro and yen 
our transactional currency exposures arise when we or one of our subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we also face currency exposure arising from the translation of the financial results of our global operations into us dollars at exchange rates that have fluctuated during the reporting period 
from time to time  we have entered into agreements to hedge certain foreign currency exposures on commitments  denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
there were no foreign exchange forward contracts  transactions  or open contracts at december  or based on inamed s overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on its balance sheet  sales  net income  or cash flows over a one year period
