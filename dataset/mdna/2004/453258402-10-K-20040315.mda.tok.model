item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes  which are expressed in us dollars and prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which generally conform with those principles established in the united states  except as explained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this md a contains certain forward looking statements based on our current expectations 
these forward looking statements entail various risks and uncertainties  as discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward looking statements 
reference is also made to the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements above 
this md a includes the following sections in addition to this overview results of operations cash flows  liquidity and capital resources risks and uncertainties sensitivities critical accounting policies and estimates accounting changes outlook non gaap financial measure nature of our business we are a leading producer of nickel  a hard  malleable metal which  given its properties and wide range of applications  can be found in thousands of products 
the largest end use for nickel is in the production of austenitic or nickel bearing stainless steels 
this end use currently accounts for about two thirds of demand for primary nickel  which we define to be nickel produced from nickel containing ores 
we are also an important producer of copper  precious metals and cobalt and a major producer of value added specialty nickel products 
our principal mines and processing operations are located in the sudbury area of ontario  the thompson area of manitoba and  through a subsidiary in which we have an equity interest of per cent  pt international nickel indonesia tbk pt inco  on the island of sulawesi  indonesia 
we have additional wholly owned metals refineries at port colborne  ontario and in the united kingdom at clydach  wales and acton  england 
we also have interests in nickel refining capacity in japan  through contractual arrangements with inco tnc limited  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  in taiwan  through taiwan nickel refining corporation  in which we have an equity interest of per cent  and in south korea  through korea nickel company  in which we have an equity interest of per cent 
we also have a per cent equity interest in jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd  a company that produces nickel salts for plating and other applications at a plant near shanghai in the people s republic of china china 
we are currently in the process of expanding our commercial relationships in china through the participation in a venture that plans to produce nickel foam products for the asian battery market beginning in we have been evaluating other commercial relationships in china and in early march we started up a shearing and packaging operation for certain nickel products to service the specific needs of this market 
our business operations consist of two segments  our i finished products segment  representing our mining and processing operations in ontario and manitoba  our refining operations in the united kingdom and interests in the refining operations in japan and other asian countries referred to above  and ii intermediates segment  which represents pt inco s mining and processing operations in indonesia  where nickel in matte  an intermediate product  is produced and sold primarily into the japanese market 
in addition  as part of our strategy to be the world s lowest cost and most profitable nickel producer  we are currently developing or plan to develop two major new or so called greenfield projects  our wholly owned voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project in the 
table of contents province of newfoundland and labrador and our approximately per cent owned goro nickel cobalt project in the french overseas territorial community collectivit territoriale of new caledonia new caledonia 
a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the current development or planned development of these projected low cost sources of nickel and other metals  including political  regulatory  design  construction  labour  operating  technical and technological risks  uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financial risks and  in the case of goro  those risks related to the possible future transition to independence of new caledonia 
reference is made to risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties and outlook below in this md a 
as noted below under results of operations compared with goro project suspension costs  in early december we initiated a comprehensive review of the goro project and that review  being conducted in two phases  continued in the initial phase of this review was completed in july and the second phase is currently expected to be completed in the summer of in recent years  sales of our primary metal products were concentrated in the united states  europe  japan  elsewhere in asia  and canada  with about per cent of our revenues from nickel derived from sales of our nickel products in asia 
key factors affecting our business the price of nickel has represented  and is currently expected to continue to represent  the principal determinant of our profitability and cash flows from operations 
accordingly  our financial performance has been  and is expected to continue to be  closely linked to the price of nickel and  to a lesser extent  the price of copper and other primary metals produced by us 
historically  the demand for nickel has been closely correlated to industrial production in the major industrialized regions  in particular north america and europe and more recently asia  and we expect this positive correlation to continue 
during we experienced  and currently expect to continue to experience at least in and  very favourable realized prices for the nickel products we produce based upon the relationship between global nickel supply and demand given that global nickel supply is not expected to keep pace with global nickel demand 
accordingly  we expect that the global nickel market will experience shortages in nickel supply relative to demand which we believe will  in turn  affect nickel prices in at least and in  our average realized price for the nickel products we sold was  per tonne per pound  compared with  per tonne per pound for the london metal exchange lme cash price for nickel  the price that is generally viewed as the benchmark price for nickel  averaged  per tonne per pound in compared with  per tonne per pound in since we sell our nickel products in all major geographical markets  the realized prices for our primary nickel and other metal products are influenced by both global and regional supply demand factors and by the availability and prices of secondary or metal containing scrap material  including nickel containing scrap generated by the stainless steel industry and other substitute or competing commodity products for the primary nickel and other metal products we produce 
we believe that the growth in nickel demand in asia  and in particular china  has been the most important factor in the rise in our realized nickel prices and the lme cash nickel price in we currently expect this growth to continue to affect nickel demand and nickel prices for the next couple of years 
if demand for nickel in asia  and in particular china  were to decline significantly  such an event would be expected to significantly affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
to the extent that  given the positive correlation that has existed historically between demand for nickel and industrial production  other industrialized regions of the world were to experience slower economic growth or an actual decline in economic growth  such a development would also be expected to affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
we have experienced periods of low nickel prices due to over supply conditions and or declines in nickel demand and  given the historically cyclical nature of nickel supply and demand  we expect that similar periods could reoccur in the future which could result in our experiencing unfavourable results of operations  including net losses and negative cash flows 
while global demand for nickel is the most important determinant of our profitability and cash flows  our financial results are also very much affected by increases in the costs we incur to produce nickel and our other metals 
in and  we experienced increases in our costs due to a number of factors  including rising energy and pension expenses  and in the case of  the relative strengthening of the canadian dollar to the 
table of contents us dollar and the effect this has had on our operating costs incurred in canadian dollars 
while we have continued to implement programs designed to manage our costs  our ability to successfully do so will influence our profitability and cash flows 
as discussed above  we have been moving forward with our two key development projects 
in  we spent approximately million on the initial phase of our voisey s bay project  which phase consists of an open pit mine  concentrator and related facilities and certain research and development and other programs  and currently expect to spend approximately million on this initial phase in we expect to make a decision by the summer of on whether  and how  we will proceed with our goro project 
assuming that we do reach a decision to proceed with this project in the summer of  after the second phase of the comprehensive review of our goro project is completed  we could be spending approximately million in on this project 
these development projects are very important to our future given that the voisey s bay project represents a key source of intermediate product for our manitoba and ontario operations for the period and these projects will be needed if we are to remain a leading nickel producer in an expected growing nickel market 
if there are significant delays in when these projects are completed and are producing on a commercial and consistent scale  and or their capital costs were to be significantly higher than estimated  these events could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows 
we currently plan to rely  at least in part  on and accordingly  need to generate  very substantial cash flows to meet our sustaining capital expenditure requirements and the planned capital expenditures for our development projects 
our planned capital expenditures are expected to total  million in if we do not realize satisfactory prices for the nickel and other metals that we produce  we would need to raise very significant additional capital through the capital markets and or incur significant borrowings to meet our capital requirements 
these financing requirements could adversely affect our credit ratings and our ability to access the capital markets in the future to meet any external financing requirements we might have 
until we are able to produce intermediate products from our voisey s bay project for further processing at our canadian operations  our canadian operations  in particular  our manitoba operations  will remain increasingly dependant  in order to continue to produce nickel products at  or close to  their capacity  on purchases of intermediate products principally from two australian companies 
if these suppliers experienced problems in producing or shipping to canada their intermediate products  these events would have an adverse effect on our ability to produce and sell the nickel products we plan to produce at least in and and would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
extended strikes  such as the one we experienced at our ontario operations in  other labour disruptions and unforeseen events could also adversely affect our production plans and costs and these developments could also adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
given the nature of our business  compliance with environmental regulations is very important to our operations 
to the extent that there are changes in environmental regulations beyond those currently in effect which are applicable to our operations and these changes require further reductions in emissions beyond what our operations are currently required to meet  such developments could require a reduction in our production levels and or significant additional capital expenditures to meet such requirements 
these developments could be expected to also adversely affect our ability to finance any such required capital expenditures and our other capital requirements as well as our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows

reflects restated results as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the nickel industry is highly competitive in all of its key aspects  including the exploration for  and the development of  new sources of supply  the acquisition of deposits  and the processing  distribution and marketing of nickel products 
the level of production and export of primary nickel from the russian federation russia as well as the supply of nickel containing scrap material  together with the continuing relatively limited level of domestic consumption of nickel in russia since the break up of the former soviet union  has had  and could continue to have  a significant impact on the nickel industry s supply demand balance 
while we produce primary nickel  the other type of nickel used in industrial applications is known as secondary nickel  which is also referred to as recycled or scrap nickel 
secondary nickel units are recovered largely from austenitic stainless steel manufacturing and fabricating operations and nickel containing scrap from obsolete facilities and equipment 
in the recent past  secondary nickel has represented between and per cent of the total nickel used in the production of nickel bearing or austenitic stainless steels  with primary nickel accounting for between and per cent of such nickel use 
these percentages can vary based upon relative prices  the availability of scrap and other factors 
to the extent that the supply of such secondary nickel increases  such an occurrence could also adversely affect nickel prices and our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
with the increase in nickel prices experienced in  the nickel industry has seen some substitution of other less costly metals or materials for nickel in certain applications 
any significant increases in such substitution  particularly if such changes represented a permanent shift away from the use of nickel  would be expected to adversely affect nickel demand and our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
highlights the year was one of significant improvement in the world nickel market 
we believe that the increase in the lme cash price for nickel for was principally due to continued strong and growing demand for nickel and nickel containing materials in asia  in particular china  and the continued significant growth in world stainless steel production 
the global nickel market was essentially in balance for as a result of the release into the market of approximately  tonnes million pounds of nickel or about five per cent of total global nickel supply that we understand one leading nickel producer had initially pledged as collateral for a loan 

table of contents we experienced a three month strike at our ontario operations which began june  prior to the strike  all of our principal operations were operating above planned production levels for operating costs continued to represent a major challenge for us in due to a stronger canadian dollar  higher energy costs  increased pension expense  higher costs for purchased intermediates and lower by product credits 
many of these cost pressures are expected to continue in we faced three key production challenges in in addition to the strike in ontario and the ramp up problems experienced when production resumed after the strike in september  lower ore grades in canada  in particular at our manitoba operations  adverse smelter performance at our manitoba operations due to the processing of ores with higher magnesium oxide content  and reaching or exceeding pt inco s expanded production design capacity 
two of these challenges were successfully met 
at our manitoba operations  we modified certain facilities to address the higher magnesium oxide content of this operations birchtree mine ore  resulting in improved concentrate grade with no loss in recoveries 
at pt inco  we produced a record  tonnes million pounds of nickel in matte in  exceeding pt inco s production design capacity of  tonnes million pounds despite completion of a planned furnace rebuild in the first six weeks of the year 
in  improved mining and blending practices raised the ore grade at pt inco to per cent from per cent in furnace throughput at pt inco also improved based on these better ore blending practices and higher grades 
at pt inco we also increased power available to improve throughput by enabling all five hydroelectric generators to feed all furnaces 
we were able to resolve the ramp up issues encountered at our ontario operations following the three month strike and operations were on track in the fourth quarter of we made satisfactory progress on our two development projects in at our voisey s bay project  in march we completed a bankable feasibility study for the mine and concentrator and related facilities currently planned as part of the project s initial phase 
in july  we began construction of the initial phase of the project and construction proceeded on schedule and on budget in canadian dollars in at our goro project  we made good progress on the comprehensive review initiated following suspension of the project in december we currently expect to complete phase two of this review and to announce our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with this project in the third quarter of we significantly improved our financial position in through a number of financings 
we raised million in the capital markets in at attractive interest rates and used the proceeds plus cash on hand to redeem or prepay approximately million in relatively high cost preferred shares and debentures 
through these financings  we significantly reduced our cost of debt and have extended our average debt maturities from to years  with no significant debt securities maturing until beyond the currently planned construction and start up phases of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
the global nickel market reflected favourable fundamentals for nickel producers such as ourselves in as world demand grew by approximately seven per cent from levels to  tonnes despite continued economic weakness in europe and a delayed economic recovery in the united states 
industrial production in asia grew during  led by continued significant growth in china  as well as growth in south korea  taiwan and japan 
the growth in nickel demand in was concentrated in the stainless steel sector  the largest end use of primary nickel 
nickel demand growth in this sector increased by almost eight per cent in  driven by a significant increase in stainless steel production and a decline in the stainless steel scrap ratio 
the world production of stainless steel increased by nine per cent to approximately million tonnes in this growth was due  in part  to increases in production capacity and the start up of several new large scale stainless steel manufacturing facilities around the world 
stainless steel production expanded in all major industrial regions and was particularly strong in china and south korea where new production facilities were commissioned during the year 
nickel demand growth in non stainless steel applications was relatively weak in  as one important end use market  high nickel alloys for the aerospace industry  continued to struggle with new aircraft orders remaining at relatively depressed levels 
however  demand for nickel in plating applications was relatively strong  led by growth in these applications in china  slightly offset by reduced demand for these applications in europe and the united states 

table of contents the growth in world supply of primary nickel in could not keep pace with the demand growth experienced in supply of primary nickel in was adversely affected by the labour disruption at our ontario operations during a three month period beginning june  which resulted in effectively no production from these operations which would normally produce about million pounds of primary nickel per month 
we believe that several other major producers failed to reach their projected production targets due to unexpected maintenance or operational problems 
the shortfall in supply was partially offset by the release of approximately  tonnes into the market during  as discussed above 
in addition  production of ferronickel in australia  new caledonia  colombia and the dominican republic increased in as a result  world primary nickel production increased by  tonnes to  tonnes in world primary nickel supply increased to  tonnes taking into account the release of the  tonne loan collateral mentioned above 
the significant growth in nickel demand during  coupled with the limited supply growth  created an underlying deficit between supply and demand in of approximately  tonnes 
with the release of the  tonne loan collateral referred to above  we believe there was a small surplus in the global nickel market of approximately  tonnes in inventories of nickel on the lme  a physical market i where various metals  including nickel  can be bought or sold for prompt or future delivery and ii representing the principal terminal market for primary nickel in the world  increased slightly during by  tonnes  remaining at a relatively low level of  tonnes at december  as of march   lme inventories totalled  tonnes 
the lme cash nickel price opened the year at  per tonne per pound and extended the gains made in by increasing relatively steadily throughout the year 
we believe that several major events influenced the nickel price during during the first quarter  nickel prices initially rose due to strong demand from the stainless steel industry and a reduction in lme inventories 
however  prices by the beginning of march weakened with the initial release of a portion of the  tonne loan collateral into the market 
during the second quarter  speculation that a strike at our ontario operations could occur followed by the actual strike was a contributing factor in the movement of the nickel price to over  per tonne per pound and  we believe  spurred the release into the market of  tonnes from the  tonne loan collateral position 
the announcement of releases of the remaining tonnage of this collateral position was  we believe  sufficient to cause the lme price to fall below  per tonne per pound at the end of the second quarter 
the extended strike at our operations during the third quarter  accelerating demand and the fall in lme inventories  we believe  caused an increase in the nickel price to above  per tonne per pound for the first time in over three years  prompting  we believe  the release of the balance of the  tonne loan collateral over a relatively short period of time in the third quarter 
the release of the balance of the loan collateral position had little impact on the nickel price  apparently reflecting the belief that strong demand growth would continue and the fact that there was a lack of major new sources of nickel to provide additional supply for at least the next few years 
during the fourth quarter of  we believe that the market perception was that strong supply demand fundamentals were taking hold and that the market would see a significant deficit for several years 
we believe that these factors resulted in the lme cash price by the end of reaching  per tonne per pound  an increase of per cent compared with  per tonne per pound at the end of as of march   the lme cash nickel price declined to  per tonne per pound 
this decline in price early in was  we believe  related to the speed and extent to which prices had increased at the end of and was exacerbated by a lack of liquidity on the lme 
an uncertain global economic environment would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows given the historical correlation between industrial production and demand for primary nickel and the other products we produce 
there can be no assurance that over supply situations that existed in the past in the nickel markets could not reoccur in the future 
any excess supply condition would have an adverse effect on the prices realized by us for our nickel products 
other international economic trends  expectations of inflation and political events in major nickel producing and consuming countries could also adversely affect nickel prices and the prices of other metals produced by us 
these factors are beyond our control and have resulted  and are expected to continue to result  in a high degree of price volatility for nickel and other primary metals produced by us 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the price for nickel or other metals produced by us will not decline significantly from current levels 
a return to the relatively low price of nickel reflected by the lme cash nickel price which prevailed throughout most of and into the first half of when the lme cash nickel price reached a low of  per tonne per pound in december  as a result of the decrease in nickel demand experienced in and the expected increase in nickel supply to be brought into the market from three new australian laterite nickel projects that had been developed  and during a portion of the second half of when the lme cash nickel price was as low as  per tonne per pound in october  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows

highlights the world nickel market strengthened in as demand grew by approximately eight per cent during the year to  tonnes despite continued weakness in certain large segments of the global economy 
during  growth in industrial production continued in china and rebounded in most other major asian economies  excluding japan  while economic recovery in the united states  europe and japan struggled to take hold 
the growth in nickel demand was primarily concentrated in the stainless steel sector 
nickel demand growth in this sector increased by almost per cent  driven by an increase in stainless steel production and a decline in the proportion or ratio of nickel containing stainless steel scrap relative to primary nickel to the total nickel consumed by stainless steel producers 
stainless steel production increased by per cent to approximately million tonnes  with growth experienced in all major industrialized countries of the world except japan where production declined slightly 
this production growth was particularly strong in the united states  up per cent  driven by the opening of a new  tonne per year stainless steel production facility in kentucky and higher production at existing facilities elsewhere in the united states and in taiwan  where production increased by per cent as existing facilities operated at near capacity levels 
growth in primary nickel supply continued in as several relatively new or greenfield projects located in south america and australia continued to increase production to their expected design capacities 
primary nickel production on a global basis increased by  tonnes to  tonnes in the overall increase in nickel supply in came principally from i colombia and venezuela  where new or greenfield projects were completing their ramp up to their design capacities  ii australia  where production increased from the continued ramp up of one project and higher production from certain existing producers  and iii japan  where production in the form of ferronickel rebounded to near capacity levels 
the strong growth in nickel demand during largely offset the growth in nickel production  resulting in an essentially balanced market for as we estimate that the market had a small surplus of approximately previously disclosed figures for were provided on a western world plus china basis where we defined western world as being the world excluding the former east bloc countries russia and other members of the former commonwealth of independent states  china  cuba  bulgaria  the czech republic  slovakia  hungary  poland and romania

inventories of nickel on the lme increased slightly during by  tonnes  remaining at a relatively low level of  tonnes at december  the lme cash nickel price opened the year at  per tonne per pound and increased during the first half of as the economies of certain industrialized countries began to recover from their relatively low fourth quarter levels  ending the first half of the year at  per tonne per pound 
prices declined through the third quarter to the mid  per tonne level as concern over the pace of economic recovery and uncertainty about a potential war with iraq adversely affected the nickel markets

nickel production nickel production decreased by per cent to  tonnes million pounds in  compared with  tonnes million pounds in  reflecting lower production at our ontario operations due to the strike and the ramp up problems noted above  partially offset by higher production at our manitoba operations  the processing of higher volumes of purchased intermediates at both the ontario and manitoba operations and higher ore grades and higher production levels at pt inco 
our results were also negatively impacted by a planned furnace rebuild at pt inco which resulted in lower production for this operation 
finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december   compared with  tonnes at the end of the minimum finished nickel inventories we generally need to run our business and meet customers requirements have historically been about  tonnes  depending upon the required product mix 

table of contents copper production copper production decreased by per cent to  tonnes in compared with  tonnes in copper production in was below our planned target of  tonnes due to lower production at the ontario operations as a result of the strike and ramp up problems noted above 
net sales net sales for to customers increased by per cent from the previous year due to significantly higher average realized prices for nickel which were partially offset by lower deliveries of nickel  platinum  palladium  copper and cobalt  and lower realized prices for certain platinum group metals 
the decrease in deliveries was primarily due to lower production at our ontario operations as a result of the three month strike which was partially offset by higher nickel deliveries from pt inco and our manitoba operations and an increase in the deliveries of purchased finished nickel 
primary nickel sales increased by per cent in from the previous year due to a per cent increase in our average realized price partially offset by an eight per cent decrease in nickel deliveries primarily due to the three month strike at our ontario operations 
our nickel deliveries in represented an estimated per cent share of the world nickel market  compared with per cent in and per cent in our price realizations tend to lag lme cash price changes 
the premiums we realize over the prevailing lme cash price for our specialty or value added and other nickel products are affected by i fluctuations in the lme cash nickel price  ii the effect these fluctuations have on the price we receive for the nickel in matte product produced by pt inco  iii the lag effect that changes in the lme benchmark price have on the pricing of certain of our nickel products  iv how certain of our speciality nickel products are priced and v the mix of our primary nickel products sold in the year 
the average realized price for our primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in  compared with  per tonne per pound in for the january march  period  the lme cash nickel price averaged  per tonne per pound 
the price realizations for our nickel and other metal products generally reflect lme or other metal market prices and  over the longer term  depend principally upon the balance between demand for our primary nickel products in the marketplace relative to supply available from us and our competitors  including for this purpose  secondary or scrap materials containing metals in usable or recyclable form and supplies of other materials which do or may compete as substitutes 
as noted above  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  which competes directly with primary nickel as a source of nickel for use in the production of stainless steel  is particularly important to stainless steel primary nickel demand 
the stainless steel scrap ratio was per cent in  compared with per cent in and per cent in in  copper sales decreased by per cent from the previous year due to a per cent decline in deliveries due primarily to the three month strike at our ontario operations  partially offset by a per cent increase in our average realized price 
sales of precious metals decreased by per cent in due to lower deliveries from decreased production also due primarily to that three month strike

cost of sales and other operating expenses cost of sales and other operating expenses increased by per cent in  reflecting the adverse impact of a strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on our costs incurred in canadian dollars  higher energy costs  higher employment and pension costs  and increased costs for purchased intermediates processed 
in addition  deliveries of purchased finished nickel in increased by per cent primarily due to increases in the purchases of this material to meet customer requirements in the face of the strike at our ontario operations 
the cost of these purchases is based upon lme and other benchmark prices and is included in cost of sales 
operating results for included a pre tax expense of million associated with the three month strike at our ontario operations 
in addition  during the third quarter of our ontario operations experienced a series of unanticipated problems associated with the ramp up of certain of its facilities after the strike 
these problems included outages or curtailments of operations at our ontario operations oxygen plants and acid plant 
these problems resulted in lower than planned production of in process and finished material  including platinum group metals from our own ores in ontario  and an expense of million was incurred during the third quarter of due to this production shortfall 
depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expenses increased by four per cent in primarily due to higher depletion expense at pt inco  partially offset by lower depletion expense at our ontario operations due to the strike 
the increase in depletion expense at pt inco was due to higher production in at december   the net carrying value of property  plant and equipment under construction or development not subject to depreciation or depletion was  million compared with  million in and  million in which consists of amounts for the voisey s bay project totalling  million compared with  million in and  million in  the goro project of million compared with million in and million in and other assets under construction at our operations of million compared with million in and million in 
it is currently expected  assuming that a favourable decision will be made in to proceed with the goro project  that depreciation and depletion for the voisey s bay and goro projects will commence in  in line with the currently projected start of commercial production at these projects 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totalled million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher common share appreciation rights expense in connection with certain share option grants as a result of the significant increase in the price of our common shares in common share appreciation rights expense was million in compared with million in selling  general and administrative expense also included certain expenditures totalling approximately million in both and in support of our goro and voisey s bay projects 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher spending on the hydrometallurgical processing research and development program as part of the initial phase of our voisey s bay project 
exploration exploration expenses totalled million in compared with million in the increase is primarily due to higher exploration activities in new caledonia 
currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments represented primarily the effect of exchange rate movements on the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  principally post retirement benefits  accounts payable and deferred income and mining taxes  into us dollars 
unfavourable currency translation adjustments of million in were due to the significant strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during these periods 
the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate was at year end and at year end  representing approximately a per cent appreciation in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on a year to year basis 
interest expense interest expense for was million compared with million in interest paid in was higher due to the increase in our outstanding debt levels during the year 
however  this increase was offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with our projects under development and by lower interest rates on our outstanding debt for compared with  taking into account our interest rate swaps 
interest expense excluded capitalized interest of million in compared with million in we expect that our interest payments will increase to approximately million in  with approximately million of that amount expected to be expensed and million expected to be capitalized as part of our goro and voisey s bay projects 
at december   approximately per cent of our long term debt reflected interest rates that were subject to periodic adjustments based on market interest rates

goro project suspension costs in  we incurred expenses of million in connection with the on going care and custody costs associated with the construction site at our goro project while the comprehensive project review was being conducted during these expenses were partially offset by a gain of million which we recorded on forward currency contracts which had been entered into to hedge certain of the project s capital costs expected to be incurred in euros and other currencies 
these contracts became ineffective since they no longer matched the original timing of expenditures due to delays in project expenditures during with the expected completion of the second  or phase two  of the comprehensive review of the goro project in the summer of  we 
table of contents currently expect to be in a position to report on the results of the second phase in the summer of  including an updated capital cost estimate for the project and project schedule and whether  and if the decision is favourable  the terms and conditions under which  we would proceed with the project  and the additional effect  if any  that the results of this review could have on our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
other income  net other income increased to million in  compared with million in  due to gains of million realized from the sale or transfer of shares and other interests contributed to or received in conjunction with strategic and other collaborations relating to our primary metals operations  the receipt of a milestone payment of million under the terms of sale reached in of a non core exploration property and net gains of million in connection with derivative positions in metals intended to meet future customer requirements 
in addition  currency hedging gains of million were realized on the closing out of certain forward currency contracts as a consequence of the goro project suspension 
these gains were partially offset by a loss of million on the may  redemption of our convertible debentures due and lower interest income as a result of interest received on a tax refund being lower during compared with the interest on tax refunds received during income and mining taxes income and mining taxes for included a benefit of million resulting from a reduction in the canadian federal tax rate  partially offset by a million charge for an increase in the future tax rates in the province of ontario 
we also benefitted from favourable tax rulings and other decisions on tax matters from canadian and other jurisdictions concerning the tax treatment of certain prior period transactions in the amount of million as well as the favourable impact of net non taxable gains and higher earnings at pt inco  which are taxed at a relatively lower rate than earnings in other jurisdictions 
partially offsetting these tax benefits was the accrual for additional tax expense of million due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
minority interest minority interest increased to million in compared with million in our minority interest represents primarily the respective minority shareholders interests in the earnings of pt inco  inco tnc limited  jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd 
and goro nickel sa this increase in relative to was due primarily to the higher earnings at pt inco as a result of higher average realized prices for and higher deliveries of nickel in matte produced by pt inco 
nickel unit cash cost of sales since this measure captures our key costs of production and the impact of prices for our by products  nickel unit cash cost of sales represents a key performance measurement that management uses to manage our costs and operations 
nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits  representing a calculation equal to the total of all cash costs incurred to produce a unit of nickel before the deduction of contributions from by products sold divided by inco source nickel deliveries  increased to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits increased to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in the increase in nickel unit cash cost of sales both before and after by product credits in was due to the unfavourable effect of the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar on our costs incurred in canadian dollars  higher energy costs at pt inco and our ontario operations  higher employment and pension costs  higher costs for purchasing and processing larger volumes of purchased intermediates  the ramp up problems experienced at our ontario operations after the three month strike discussed above  and in addition  in 
table of contents the case of nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits  lower contributions from by products  primarily resulting from lower deliveries of platinum group metals 
a reconciliation of our nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits to cost of sales under canadian gaap is shown in the table reconciliation of nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits to canadian gaap cost of sales under non gaap financial measure below 
it is currently expected that at least some of the principal factors which have caused increases in nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits for will continue to adversely affect such nickel unit cash costs of sales into as a result of changes in certain assumptions and actual experience of plan assets as well as certain legislative and regulatory requirements referred to under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources below  we currently expect that pension expense will increase slightly from the level of million to approximately million in and  depending upon the future performance of our pension plan assets and other related factors  including changes in certain exchange rates  in particular the canadian dollar  this expense is expected to remain at least at that level until at least allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts represents three per cent and six per cent of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
in  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased slightly from million at december  to approximately million at december  the majority of this allowance relates to changes in the commercial relationships with one of our principal customers that had filed for bankruptcy protection in late march as a result of this customer s bankruptcy  such allowance increased by million as at december  this amount remained in the allowance as at december  we have no current expectation of any significant increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our past history of collection 
energy costs and relative advantages energy costs are a significant component of production costs in the nickel industry since nickel production is very energy intensive  especially with respect to the costs of processing lateritic ores such as those processed at our pt inco operations 
we enjoy relatively low energy costs because of substantial production from our canadian sulphide ores  which generally consume only about one fifth of the energy required to process lateritic ores 
in addition  low cost energy is available from our hydroelectric facilities in ontario and at pt inco s lateritic mining operations in indonesia  and from purchased hydroelectric power at our manitoba operations 
in  our hydroelectric facilities in ontario generated approximately per cent of our ontario operations electricity requirements  and pt inco s megawatt hydroelectric generating facility at larona together with its megawatt hydroelectric generating facility at balambano generated virtually all of pt inco s electrical requirements 
the balambano facility has been able to generate power consistently above its design capacity due to improved water management practices and higher reservoir levels and other related factors than were assumed in developing its original design capacity 
in  energy costs at our ontario and manitoba operations were approximately per cent of total cash production costs  compared with per cent for pt inco 
the availability of captive hydroelectric power decreased cash energy costs at pt inco by about per cent in  per cent in and per cent in relative to the energy costs that would have been incurred by pt inco if its operations were dependent on fuel oil as the sole source to meet its energy requirements 
intermediates segment our intermediates segment comprises the mining and processing operations of pt inco in indonesia where nickel in matte  an intermediate product  is produced and sold primarily into the japanese market 
net sales by pt inco of nickel in matte were million in compared with million in this increase in relative to was due to increased deliveries as a result of higher production rates and higher realized prices 
pt inco s deliveries of nickel in matte totalled a record  tonnes in compared with  tonnes in and  tonnes in the increase in compared with was due to higher production 
pt inco s net realized price for nickel in matte in averaged  per tonne per pound compared 
table of contents with  per tonne per pound in and  per tonne per pound in the selling price of pt inco s nickel in matte is determined by a formula which is based upon the lme cash price for nickel 
all of pt inco s production is sold in us dollars under long term contracts to us and sumitomo metal mining co  ltd 
nickel in matte production at pt inco increased by per cent to a record  tonnes in from  tonnes in  reflecting the processing of higher grade ore in compared with and higher production rates 
in addition  production at pt inco was adversely affected by a furnace rebuild 
cost of sales increased per cent for compared with due to the increased production volumes and higher costs due to increased consumption of fuel oil as a result of the higher production rates and higher prices paid for fuel oil to operate its dryers  kilns and its other oil fired facilities 
fuel oil costs were up per cent in from fuel oil represented about per cent of pt inco s costs of production of nickel in matte in compared with per cent in in addition  pt inco incurred additional costs for equipment rentals  employment and maintenance costs to achieve its higher production rates in development projects segment our development projects include the voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project currently under development in the province of newfoundland and labrador and the goro nickel cobalt project in new caledonia 
compared with earnings summary our results reflected a net loss of  million  or per share per share on a diluted basis in  compared with net earnings of million  or per share per share on a diluted basis in results for included  before consideration of income and mining taxes  non cash asset impairment charges of  million to reduce the carrying value of our voisey s bay project and certain other assets  a charge of million relating to the temporary suspension of certain development activities and other actions concerning our goro project  as discussed under results of operations compared with goro project suspension costs below  interest income of million associated with a tax refund and unfavourable non cash currency translation adjustments of million 
our results also reflected higher average realized prices for nickel  increased deliveries of inco source nickel and platinum group metals  higher other income and reduced interest expense  partially offset by lower realized prices for platinum group metals and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
our results included a non cash deferred tax benefit of million  and favourable currency translation adjustments of million before taxes 
the tax benefit was due to the revaluation of deferred income and mining tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
nickel production nickel production increased by one per cent to  tonnes in from  tonnes in this increase was primarily due to the decision to operate our ontario operations in without any planned maintenance shutdown 
nickel production in was  however  below the planned target of  tonnes 
nickel production was affected during the second half of by certain technical problems experienced at our manitoba operations in blending purchased nickel feed from australia with manitoba source ores  including ores with relatively high magnesium oxide levels  and maintenance and equipment problems at certain mines at our ontario operations 
the maintenance and equipment problems experienced were resolved during the first half of finished nickel inventories were  tonnes at december  compared with  tonnes at the end of copper production copper production decreased by four per cent to  tonnes in from the previous year 
copper production in was below the planned target of  tonnes 
the decline was due to production and mechanical difficulties at our ontario operations 

table of contents net sales net sales to customers increased by five per cent in from the previous year due to higher realized prices for and deliveries of nickel and higher deliveries of platinum group metals  partially offset by lower realized prices for platinum group metals 
primary nickel sales increased by per cent in from the previous year due to a per cent increase in the average realized price and a one per cent increase in deliveries 
total deliveries of nickel were higher in due to higher demand for our products  primarily in the stainless steel industry 
our nickel deliveries in represented an estimated per cent share of the world market  compared with per cent in the average realized price for our primary nickel products  including intermediates  was  per tonne per pound in compared with  per tonne per pound in copper sales decreased by six per cent in from the previous year due to a two per cent decline in our average realized price and a three per cent decline in deliveries 
sales of precious metals decreased by per cent in due to lower realized prices  partially offset by higher deliveries from increased production 
costs and expenses other income cost of sales and other operating expenses cost of sales and other operating expenses decreased by million  or three per cent  in this decrease was primarily due to lower energy costs and lower deliveries of purchased nickel to customers  partially offset by higher employment  supplies and services expenses 
depreciation and depletion depreciation and depletion expenses decreased by three per cent in from the previous year primarily due to lower depletion expense at pt inco resulting from the reduced production attributable to a planned rebuild of a furnace and related facilities which was completed during the first quarter of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in from the previous year  primarily due to increased staffing  support and other expenses related to the advancement of our goro and voisey s bay projects  higher accruals for share appreciation rights expense under our stock compensation plans  increased ontario capital taxes and higher legal fees relating primarily to certain outstanding tax matters and litigation 
currency translation adjustments currency translation adjustments of million in primarily represented the translation of canadian dollar denominated liabilities  principally accounts payable  deferred income and mining taxes and post retirement benefits  into us dollars 
the change of million from was due to a strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during  whereas in there was a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
interest expense interest expense was million in compared with million in and excluded capitalized interest of million in and million in on debt incurred to finance the development of the voisey s bay and goro projects 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt in relative to and increased capitalized interest on debt incurred to finance the development of the voisey s bay and goro projects 

table of contents asset impairment charges on june   we announced that we would be undertaking a review of the net carrying value of our voisey s bay project in view of the statement of principles entered into with the government of the province of newfoundland and labrador on that date and other arrangements with key stakeholders that would enable the development of that project to proceed 
we had noted on a number of occasions in our public filings and other documents that such events  if and when they were to occur  might require a significant reduction in the carrying value of the voisey s bay project and in the related deferred income and mining tax liability and in shareholders equity 
this review  which was completed in july  included an analysis of the key assumptions which we utilized in evaluating this net carrying value on a quarter to quarter basis relating to a number of important factors  including our best assessment of the expected cash flows from the project  how the development of voisey s bay  taking into account the agreements which have been reached  fits within our overall long term development plans and updated mining and other cost assumptions 
as a result of this review  we recorded a non cash charge of  million  net of deferred income and mining taxes of million  in the second quarter of in addition  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income and mining taxes of million  in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying values of certain plant  equipment and other assets to their estimated net recoverable amounts based on an evaluation of their recoverability 
the principal component of this charge related to capitalized exploration and development costs of the victor deep exploration project at our ontario operations that  as a result of the development of the deposits covered by our voisey s bay projects  would probably not be put into production 
the balance of this charge consisted primarily of reductions to certain redundant plant  equipment and non core assets as well as an additional provision for losses relating to certain receivables and other assets arising from our commercial relationships with one of our principal customers that had filed for bankruptcy protection in late march in the first quarter of we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million  net of income and mining taxes of million  for losses associated with certain receivables and other assets as a result of this bankruptcy filing 
goro project suspension costs in early september  the goro project experienced temporary labour disruptions by personnel associated with certain project construction subcontractors 
as a result of these disruptions  a decision was made to curtail certain activities at the project s site to enable us  contractors  subcontractors and other interested parties to develop procedures to avoid future disruptions 
over the september november period  a number of procedures were put in place as part of a phased resumption of certain of the project activities that had been curtailed 
during this period  we also initiated an update of the status of certain key aspects of the project  including the necessary permitting  capital cost estimate  project schedule and organization 
work on certain critical parts of the project  including engineering  continued during this update process 
on december   we announced that we would be undertaking a comprehensive review of the goro project 
this action had been based upon information from the project s principal firms providing project engineering  procurement and construction management services that we had received that  if confirmed  would indicate an increase in the capital cost for the project in the range of to per cent above the then current capital cost estimate of  million 
as a result of the temporary suspension of certain development activities and other actions which had been taken by year end during this review process  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge comprised million relating to the cancellation or termination of certain outstanding contractual obligations  to accrue for demobilization costs and to reduce the carrying value of certain assets relating to the project  partially offset by currency hedging gains of million on certain forward currency contracts 
these contracts  which had been entered into to reduce exposure to exchange rate changes associated with certain planned project expenditures to be incurred in certain currencies  were closed out in early january since they no longer matched the timing of such expenditures due to their expected deferral as a result of the review being undertaken 

table of contents other income  net other income increased by million in  primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents in  compared with  interest income of million associated with a tax refund and gains realized from the sales of securities 
income and mining taxes in  the effective income and mining tax rate of relief was per cent  compared with per cent in in  income and mining taxes included a deferred tax benefit of million due to the revaluation of deferred income and mining tax liabilities for reductions in future tax rates by the provinces of ontario and manitoba 
excluding this benefit  the effective tax rate in was lower than the effective rate of per cent in the decrease was primarily due to the impact of the asset impairment charges  a portion of which was not deductible for tax purposes  lower mining taxes and lower foreign tax rate differences  partially offset by lower resource and depletion allowances 
minority interest minority interest of million in represents principally the respective minority shareholders interests in the earnings of pt inco  inco tnc limited  jinco nonferrous metals co  ltd 
and goro nickel sa the increase in minority interest in from the previous year was due primarily to the higher earnings of pt inco  partially offset by million relating to the goro project suspension costs referred to above 
nickel unit cash cost of sales nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits increased slightly to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in this increase was due to higher operating expenses  principally employment  services and supplies expenses  partially offset by lower energy costs at pt inco due to lower consumption of and prices for fuel oil 
nickel unit cash cost of sales after by product credits increased by seven per cent to  per tonne per pound in from  per tonne per pound in  primarily due to lower realized prices for palladium  copper and cobalt  and higher nickel unit cash cost of sales before by product credits  partially offset by higher deliveries of precious metals 
a reconciliation of our nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits to cost of sales under canadian gaap is shown in the table reconciliation of nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits to canadian gaap cost of sales under non gaap financial measure below 
allowance for doubtful accounts in  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase of million was as a result of one of our principal customers filing for bankruptcy protection in late march excluding this change  our allowance was million at december  and energy costs and relative advantages in  our hydroelectric facilities in ontario generated approximately per cent of our ontario operations electricity requirements  and pt inco s hydroelectric generating facility at larona and its newer hydroelectricity facility at balambano generated virtually all of pt inco s electricity requirements 
in  energy costs at our ontario and manitoba operations were approximately per cent of total cash production costs  compared with per cent for pt inco 
the availability of captive hydroelectric power decreased cash energy costs at pt inco by about per cent in and about per cent in relative to the energy costs that would have been incurred had pt inco s sole source of energy been fuel oil 

table of contents intermediates segment net sales of nickel in matte by pt inco were million in compared with million in the increase in compared with was due to a modest increase in deliveries and higher realized prices 
net realized prices for nickel in matte in averaged  per tonne per pound compared with  per tonne per pound in pt inco s nickel in matte production in declined to  tonnes compared with  tonnes in  reflecting the rebuild of one of pt inco s furnaces and related facilities during cost of sales increased per cent in compared with due to the increased deliveries and higher production costs 
increased costs in relative to were due to additional overburden stripping costs and drilling associated with the additional mining requirements to meet pt inco s planned production and an increase in supplies and services costs 
cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared with operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in totalled million  which represented a significant decrease from the million in net cash provided by operating activities in during  increased cash was required for working capital due to higher accounts receivable  higher inventories and lower income and mining taxes payable in compared with the prior year  with this increased cash requirement being partially offset by higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to significantly higher selling prices for our finished nickel products and  to a lesser degree  due to higher deliveries of our finished nickel products in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of inventories were higher at the end of compared with due to higher volumes of both finished and in process nickel on hand at the end of the year  as well as higher costs 
the higher costs were due  in part  to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in  higher costs for the post retirement benefits we provide  higher energy costs as a result of the increased utilization rates and costs for natural gas and heavy oil and higher costs for purchased intermediates during the fourth quarter of given that these intermediates are priced based upon lme and other benchmark prices 
income and mining taxes payable declined during as a result of higher tax payments during the year  the majority of which payments related to taxes paid of million in respect of accounts payable and accrued liabilities were significantly higher at the end of as a result of the increases related to the accrual for stock appreciation rights  the accrual for estimated remediation costs for certain former industrial sites in the united states and the impact of the strengthening of the canadian dollar because a significant portion of our accounts payable is denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result of the timing of our normal tax payments  tax payments totalling approximately million in respect of are expected to be made by the end of the first quarter of versus million in we have had in effect for a number of years defined benefit pension plans principally in canada  the united states and the united kingdom 
each of the jurisdictions in which these plans are located has legislation and regulations which  among other statutory requirements  cover the minimum contributions to be made to these plans to meet their potential liabilities as calculated in accordance with such legislation and regulations 
based upon the value of the assets in these plans  as determined pursuant to applicable provincial legislation and regulations in canada and other factors to be taken into account under such legislative or regulatory requirements  we  in accordance with such applicable legislation or regulations  increased our contributions  including voluntary contributions  to such plans to a level of million for  up from million in  and our pension expense increased to million for from million in we currently expect that our pension contributions will increase to approximately million in at least and and pension expense will increase to approximately million for at least and since the liabilities associated with these pension plans are affected by changes in certain exchange rates  mostly the canadian dollar  changes in such exchange rates could also significantly affect the level of these contributions and pension expense for future years

to provide liquidity for our operations  we have committed credit facilities which aggregated million as of year end all of these credit facilities were undrawn as of year end these facilities are provided by a group of lenders under separate agreements where the terms of each agreement are substantially the same 
except for four facilities totalling million in commitments  the facilities include revolving commitments from days to four years 
the four facilities totalling million in commitments have only revolving periods  which expire either in june  june or june the respective revolving period of all of the facilities may be extended for an additional day period at the discretion of the respective bank under the particular facility  subject to the approval of lenders representing  in the aggregate  at least per cent of the total aggregate commitments under the facilities  and any amounts outstanding at the maturity of the revolving period are repayable at that time 
the revolving periods for the facilities currently expire on dates ranging from june  to june   with million of these facilities expiring on june  while we do not currently expect that we will not be able to renew these facilities when they expire we cannot predict what  if any  changes in the interest rates or other terms and conditions of such facilities might be required to obtain their renewal 
the borrowings under these facilities may be made in canadian dollars in the form of prime rate loans or bankers acceptances or in us dollars in the form of us base rate loans or london interbank offered rate libor loans 
borrowing under these facilities bear interest  when drawn  at a rate which varies based on the type of borrowing and our credit ratings at the time of borrowing 
if a significant portion of these facilities could not be renewed on acceptable terms to us  this development could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to meet our financing requirements for our existing operations and development projects  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
each credit facility provides that  so long as advances are outstanding  we will be required to maintain a tangible net worth  as defined  of not less than billion and a ratio of consolidated indebtedness  as defined  to tangible net worth  as defined  not to exceed at december   such tangible net worth was billion and the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to tangible net worth was there can be no assurance that future material adverse developments would not result in a breach of these covenants 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants  the lenders would have the right to declare a default and require all then outstanding loans to be repaid and pursue the various remedies available to them under the credit facilities  including declining to make any new loans under such facilities 
any such action by the lenders could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our financing requirements for our existing operations and development projects  and our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
none of these facilities have any covenant which would require any acceleration or prepayment of outstanding balances if our credit ratings on outstanding debt securities were downgraded or there were a significant decline in our earnings  cash flows or in the price of our publicly traded common shares or other equity securities but a downgrade in rating would increase the interest rate payable on borrowings under the facilities and  conversely  an upgrade in the rating would decrease the interest rate payable on borrowings 
the credit rating agencies rate our outstanding debt securities  which were rated as investment grade as of march   according to criteria they utilize for such purposes 
these criteria include  among others  our profitability  balance sheet and interest coverage ratios  and future business plans and prospects 
accordingly  our credit ratings are dependent upon a number of factors  including the views of the credit rating agencies on the nickel industry s supply demand balance and the long term price of nickel and our ability to continue to be one of the low cost producers of primary nickel and generate cash flows from operations 
any significant downgrade in our current credit ratings could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our access to the capital markets  the terms under which we can borrow funds on a short term and long term basis and accordingly  on our liquidity 
our total debt as a percentage of our total debt plus shareholders equity as of december for the years indicated is set forth in the following table december total debt as of total debt plus shareholders equity we currently believe that our level of cash and cash equivalents as of december   together with currently projected cash to be provided by our operations  available cash from our unused lines of credit and access to international capital markets  will be more than sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements at least for and these requirements include ongoing cash needs for our operations as well as the cash required to finance currently planned expenditures on sustaining and other capital projects  including our voisey s bay and goro projects 
as discussed above  our required capital expenditures are very significant over the period given the current spending plans for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project and assuming that we reach the decision in the summer of to move forward with the goro project 
our liquidity is affected by a number of key factors  including decreases in the amount of  and a change in the timing of  our production outlook at our existing operations as well as the timing of completion of our goro and voisey s bay projects 
reference is made to risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties pt inco  risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties risks associated with  and importance of  future low cost nickel projects and risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below for detailed discussions of these factors and their impact on our liquidity 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes as at december  certain of our contractual obligations and other identified commercial commitments for the periods specified less than after total year years years years millions long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations post retirement benefit obligations asset retirement obligations other long term liabilities and contractual obligations total these purchase obligations are largely related to our goro and voisey s bay projects with the balance comprising routine orders to purchase goods and services at our current operating locations 
amounts included in post retirement benefit obligations in the table above represent the various contractual funding requirements for our pension plans in and include a planned voluntary contribution to be made in excess of statutory or regulatory requirements 
the obligatory funding requirements for our pension plans are actuarially determined and are subject to future uncertainties  including the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate on pension obligations  each of which may change over time 
the amounts included in asset retirement obligations represent our present legal obligations for closure and related costs at all our existing operating mines and non operating mines and properties based upon the closure plans applicable to those mines and properties 
the contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
table of contents set forth in the table above include our commitments for the goro and voisey s bay projects  as noted under outlook below  as of december  except for these commitments  this table does not include our expected capital expenditures over the next five years and thereafter since such expenditures do not represent contractual obligations or commercial commitments 
we currently estimate that our existing operations require  on an annual basis  in the range of approximately million of capital expenditures to sustain their operations and to meet current environmental regulations and similar requirements at our currently planned production and or utilization levels for these operations 
the capital expenditures for the initial phase of our voisey s bay project and our goro project will be dependent on a number of factors  including  in the case of the goro project  the results of the second phase of the comprehensive review process for the goro project referred to under results of operations compared with goro project suspension costs above  the availability of certain financing from the french government and the acquisition  as discussed under outlook goro project below  of an interest in the goro project by one or more parties 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million to secure a portion of our closure costs related to the closure of three mines in ontario 
these letters of credit have a term of one year and will automatically renew without any action by either us or the party who issued the letters of credit until the earlier of i us having complied with the terms of the closure plans covering these mines  as filed with the ontario government  or ii funds from such letters of credit being utilized by the ontario ministry of northern development and mines  the ministry responsible for overseeing such closure plans  to perform any rehabilitation work if inco does not meet its requirements with respect to such closure plans 
we have also provided  in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  letters of credit or similar forms of financial assurance to secure future closure costs associated with our voisey s bay project and certain other operations or projects in north america and elsewhere which currently have  or are expected to have  fairly extended useful lives 
during  we had discussions with representatives of the province of manitoba regarding what amount of financial assurance might be required for our manitoba operations in the future under recently enacted regulations 
it is currently expected that discussions with representatives of the province of manitoba in will result in an agreed level of and timeline for when financial assurance for these operations would be required 
we currently cannot predict what amount of financial assurance will be required but we do not believe that it will have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
in connection with our acquisition of diamond fields resources inc  we assumed an obligation to pay to a company retained by diamond field resources inc to provide certain exploration and other services an annual royalty amounting to three per cent of the net proceeds received from the sale of ores  metals and other minerals produced from our voisey s bay project  after deducting certain costs associated with the production and sale of the ores  metals and minerals produced 
we have not incurred any such royalty payments to date since the voisey s bay project is not yet in production 
we are also committed to pay a quarterly production royalty to the indonesian government in respect of our nickel ore production in indonesia 
the royalty is determined based on the nickel or cobalt  as applicable  content of the ore and ranges from to per kilogram contained in the ore  based on certain assumptions with respect to the market price of nickel 
during the years ended december   and  we paid royalties to the indonesian government amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
we are required to make certain periodic payments in connection with the use of our mining properties and processing facilities  including payments for our mining licences  leases  occupation and surface rights 
during the years ended december   and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  in such payments 
with respect to any mandatory redemption requirements over the period  reference is made to i the discussion below under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared to financing activities relating to the special contingent conversion right that holders of certain of our convertible debt have and ii note to our consolidated financial statements for information on the redemption provisions of certain long term debt 

table of contents there are no significant long term contractual arrangements with any related parties that create or result in any obligations that are not on an arm s length  negotiated basis 
compared with operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  up from million in this increase was due primarily to higher earnings  excluding asset impairment and other non cash charges  and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities and income and mining taxes payable 
net tax refunds totalled million in  compared with net tax payments of million in investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher planned capital expenditures  mainly in respect of our voisey s bay and goro projects 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in increased to million from million in principally as a result of the two debt offerings discussed below 
on may   we issued and sold through an underwritten public offering in the united states million aggregate principal amount of notes due the net cash proceeds of million received from this sale  after commissions and other expenses  were used to finance certain capital expenditures relating to existing operations and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures for development projects 
on september   we issued and sold through an underwritten public offering in the united states million aggregate principal amount of debentures due the net cash proceeds of million received from this sale  after commissions and other expenses  were used to fund capital requirements to sustain existing operations and for general corporate purposes  which we indicated at the time could include the purchase or redemption of outstanding securities other than common shares and funding capital expenditures for development projects 
holders of our zero coupon convertible notes lyon notes due march  had a special conversion right  exercisable on april   giving them the right to convert the then accreted value of their lyon notes totalling approximately million into common shares at the then market price of such shares 
on april   none of the holders of the lyon notes elected to exercise their right to convert the lyon notes into common shares 
subsequent special conversion rights may be exercised on march in each of  and if holders were to exercise these rights  we have the right to satisfy this special conversion feature by delivering cash in lieu of common shares and it is our current intention to satisfy any future conversions and the related accreted value of the lyon notes in cash 
preferred dividends totalling million were paid in each of the years and on the preferred shares series e in accordance with the terms of those shares 
dividends paid to minority interest shareholders were million in each of and at december   cash and cash equivalents totalled  million  up significantly from million at december   reflecting increased net cash provided by operating activities and a significant portion of the aggregate net proceeds of million received from the sales of debt securities in the second and third quarters of total debt at december  was  million  up million from million at the end of  reflecting the two debt offerings in 
table of contents risks and uncertainties the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook and future prospects 
market risk we define market risk as being the risk of potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
given the nature of our business and operations  the areas of highest market risk or exposure for us are nickel prices and  to a lesser extent  our prices of other metals and commodities that we produce or purchase representing what we refer to as our metals and commodities risk  foreign currency exchange rates representing what we refer to as our foreign exchange risk and interest rates representing what we refer to as our interest rate risk  all of which are discussed below 
in the case of our metals and commodities risk  we sell our products at prices based on world market prices and purchase fuel oil and other supplies at market prices since these supplies are essentially commodities which can be purchased from a large number of available sources 
in addition to the two australian sources of intermediate products referred to under overview above  we have a limited number of sole source suppliers of critical materials or services  including electricity in canada and other locations 
while the prices for our primary nickel and other metals produced are based largely on  and sold in  us dollars  we are subject to foreign exchange risk because we incur a substantial portion of our costs and expenses in currencies other than the us dollar  in particular the canadian dollar 
we are exposed to additional foreign exchange risk and are also exposed to interest rate risk because  to the extent that we fund our operations and capital expenditures primarily through long term and short term borrowings  these borrowings are primarily in us dollars 
based upon past movements of certain foreign currency exchange rates  as described below  and our current expectations of continued volatility in such exchange rates for  we believe that the potential near term impact on future earnings and cash flows with respect to a change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
based upon recent past movements in interest rates  as described below  and our current expectations of changes in interest rates in  we currently believe that the potential near term impact of such changes on future earnings will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the metals and commodity risks relating to nickel and  to a lesser extent  other metals produced by us  given the significance of price realizations to us of such metals  are expected to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we have engaged in transactions to reduce to a significant degree the impact of certain of these market risks to which we are exposed on our earnings and cash flows 
we have established policies and procedures governing the use of derivative instruments to address certain market risks 
these policies and procedures are intended to reduce some of the uncertainties associated with the market risks specific to our business and operations and reduce the effect of market fluctuations relating to the metals we produce and supplies of products and services we need for our operations on our earnings and cash flows 
we only use derivative instruments based on an economic analysis of the underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse effects on future earnings and cash flows due to fluctuations in metals and commodities prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates will be offset by proceeds from  and changes in the fair value of  the derivative instruments 
we do not  however  hedge our exposure to all market risks and do not hedge our exposure to any market risk in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flows 
we have had in place an internal risk management committee for a number of years 
this committee is comprised of senior financial and marketing executives and chaired by our chief executive officer 
this internal committee oversees our hedging activities  whereby we use derivative instruments to reduce market risks 
the risk management committee s oversight includes reviewing compliance with our risk management policies authorized by our board of directors 
the risk management policies set forth the responsibilities of the internal risk management committee  its membership and conduct  reporting requirements  controls  maximum hedging limits and related authorizations delegated by our board of directors 
under our risk management policies  hedging activities are restricted by maximum limits which are specifically approved by our board of directors 
the maximum limits are usually tied to a maximum percentage 
table of contents of forecast annual production volume or annual requirements  in the case of supplies or currencies  as the case may be for current and future years  up to five years 
maximum limits are as follows for nickel year per cent of forecast annual production  year per cent  year per cent  copper  platinum  palladium and gold years and per cent of forecast annual production  years to per cent  supplies such as oil  natural gas and electricity year per cent of forecast annual requirements  year per cent  years to per cent  and foreign currency year per cent of forecast annual requirements  years and per cent  years and per cent 
to the extent that we hedge for certain metals other than nickel and for supplies and foreign currencies  we have historically hedged at levels below these limitations absent specific circumstances where we believe that hedging up to or close to such limits would be appropriate 
in the case of metals  other than nickel  produced by us  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments to fix minimum realized prices and  in the case of nickel  as discussed below  we have entered into formal sales or purchase contracts to hedge certain sales to our customers or purchases by us from suppliers of intermediate products 
in addition  interest rate swaps may  pursuant to our annual financing plan approved each year by our board of directors  be entered into annually to change maximum amounts of indebtedness  in the case of up to million  subject to increases in this maximum relating to specific financings  from fixed to floating rate debt or floating to fixed rate debt at rates not to exceed those covering authorized debt securities and maximum of hedges  in the case of up to million  may be entered into to fix rates on a short term basis in anticipation of a financing 
in addition to a quarterly review by our internal risk management committee  for each quarter all hedging activities and hedge positions are reviewed with and reported to our audit committee 
our internal audit group is also responsible for examining internal controls  trade execution and monitoring  reporting and compliance with the risk management policy annually 
metals and commodities risk we are subject to metals and commodities risk because we sell our products and purchase fuel oil and other supplies or services at prices for the most part effectively determined through trading on major commodity exchanges  in particular the lme and the new york mercantile exchange 
the prices offered on these exchanges generally reflect the global balance of supply and demand for the particular metal or commodity but are also influenced in the short term by such factors as investment funds flow  speculative activity in the particular commodity and currency exchange rates 
the price of nickel  our principal product  represents the major factor influencing our results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
the selling prices for our primary nickel products are generally based on the lme cash nickel price 
however  certain of our products are customarily sold at a premium over the lme cash price  particularly special products such as nickel powders and foams 
the markets for our products have been  and are expected to continue to be  cyclical in nature and prices have been and are expected to continue to be volatile 
however  because we are one of the largest producers and marketers of primary nickel in the world  we have chosen  subject to certain limited exceptions as discussed below  not to hedge or otherwise attempt to mitigate to any significant degree the risk of fluctuations in the price of nickel 
we review this policy from time to time and may choose to increase the currently limited use of derivative instruments to reduce such risks in the future 
in the case of other metals produced by us  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments to fix minimum realized prices 
we do enter into lme forward purchase contracts which are substantially offset by fixed price customer contracts in order to more fully expose us to nickel price risk 
we also enter into lme forward sales contracts to minimize nickel price risk associated with purchased nickel inventories of intermediates and finished nickel products 
in respect of these types of hedges  at december  we had outstanding lme forward contracts to purchase  tonnes of nickel during the to period at an average price of  per tonne per pound and lme forward contracts to sell  tonnes of nickel during at an average price of  per tonne per pound 
while we have  from time to time  utilized derivative instruments to hedge the price of copper we realize  we did not utilize any such instruments covering our copper production in or 
table of contents depending on market conditions  we enter into precious metals hedging contracts with various financial counterparties 
these contracts  in the form of swap contracts whereby we simultaneously sell at a fixed price and buy the same quantities for the same maturity dates at a floating price  are intended to provide certain minimum price realizations in respect of a portion of our future production of such metals 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of palladium during under the swap contracts  we receive a fixed price of per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of platinum in aggregate over the period from to under these swap contracts  we receive fixed prices ranging from to per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding swap contracts to exchange payments on  troy ounces of gold in aggregate during and under these swap contracts  we receive fixed prices ranging from to per troy ounce and pay a floating price based on monthly average spot prices 
at december   we had outstanding put option contracts  giving us the right but not the obligation  to sell  troy ounces of platinum at an average price of per troy ounce at various dates over the to period  and sold call option contracts  giving the buyer the right  but not the obligation  to purchase platinum at an average price of per troy ounce during the same time period 
at december   we also had outstanding put option contracts  giving us the right  but not the obligation  to sell  troy ounces of gold at an average price of per troy ounce at various dates during  and sold call option contracts  giving the buyer the right  but not the obligation  to purchase gold at an average price of per troy ounce during the same time period 
we use fuel oil swap contracts to hedge the effect of fuel oil price changes in respect of a portion of our energy requirements in indonesia 
under these contracts  we receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed and a floating price for fuel oil 
at december   we had entered into swap contracts with financial institutions to exchange payments on  tonnes of fuel oil in aggregate during and under the swap contracts  we pay fixed prices averaging per tonne for fuel oil and receive a floating price based on monthly average spot price quotations 
reference is made to note to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning our derivative instruments  including how the fair value of such instruments has been determined 
once our development projects begin commercial production  we will become a significant producer of cobalt 
when that occurs  we could be affected by the highly competitive market for cobalt that currently exists and is expected to continue to exist 
cobalt sold to customers is currently sold either on a fixed price basis using annual contracts for customers in certain industries or on the basis of prices as quoted in the metals bulletin and platts  which are recognized metals industry publications that publish cobalt and other metal prices 
such published prices are generally accepted as representing the benchmark or market price indicator for cobalt 
cobalt  like nickel and copper  has historically been subject to significant price volatility and we currently expect that such volatility will continue 
the financial analyses undertaken by us in support of the substantial investment to be made with respect our development projects has been based upon a long term price of cobalt of per kilogram per pound 
if realized cobalt prices  as well as realized prices for the other metals to be produced by these projects  were to be below the long term prices assumed by us  the expected financial returns from  and expected cash and other costs for  these projects would be adversely affected 
at december   none of our currently planned nickel or copper production is covered by or subject to derivative contracts 
at december   we had entered into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our planned precious metals production over varying periods up to three years 
outstanding derivative contracts for platinum cover per cent  per cent and per cent of planned platinum production in  and  respectively  for palladium the derivative contracts cover per cent of planned palladium production in and for gold the derivative contracts cover per cent and per cent of planned gold production in and  respectively 
each derivative contract matures in  or  indicated above for the planned production to which it relates 
we currently expect to produce precious metals from our estimated proven and probable ore reserves at our ontario operations for a period in excess of twenty years  a period that extends well beyond the maturity of our current derivative contracts covering precious metals 

table of contents foreign exchange risk by virtue of our international operations  we incur costs and expenses in a number of foreign currencies other than the us dollar 
the exchange rates covering such currencies have varied substantially in the last three years 
a substantial portion of our revenue is received in us dollars since the price of nickel and other metals we produce are generally referenced in us dollars  while a significant portion of our costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and between the us dollar and certain other currencies gives rise to foreign currency exposure  either favourable or unfavourable  which have materially affected and are expected to continue to affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our primary foreign exchange risk is to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we reduce  from time to time  the impact of this risk by entering into forward currency contracts and foreign currency options 
however  these activities do not eliminate the potentially significant adverse effect that exchange rate fluctuations could have on our results of operations or financial condition 
at the end of  these contracts took the form of forward contracts which establish a fixed exchange rate for the canadian dollar and forward currency contracts that establish a fixed price for the future purchases of the euro and australian dollar covering future capital and other expenditures relating to the goro project 
the purpose of the forward currency contracts is to hedge i a portion of future canadian dollar production costs and ii future canadian dollar capital expenditures relating to our voisey s bay project 
the purpose of the euro and australian dollar forward currency contracts is to hedge a portion of the future construction costs of the planned production facilities for the goro project in new caledonia assuming we decide to proceed with this project 
as discussed under results of operations compared with goro project suspension costs above  certain of these forward currency contracts relating to our goro project were closed out in we are  to a substantially lesser extent  also subject to fluctuations in the value of the indonesian rupiah relative to the us dollar as a result of our operations in indonesia 
this impact is reduced by the fact that a significant portion of pt inco s costs and revenues are effectively denominated in us dollars 
because of the limited nature of this exposure  we do not customarily hedge the value of the rupiah against the us dollar and no such financial instruments were in effect at december  at december   we had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase aus 
million and million euros at average exchange rates of and  respectively  during the purpose of these contracts  as discussed above  is to hedge a portion of the future construction costs of the planned production facilities for the goro project in new caledonia assuming a decision is made to proceed with the project 
in respect of our currency contracts to hedge against the foreign exchange risks associated with the goro project  total gains in the amount of million were recorded in as income due to forward currency contracts that became ineffective due to the deferral of a portion of the originally planned expenditures for this project 
at december   we had outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average exchange rate of during the purpose of these contracts is to hedge a portion of the future construction costs of the planned facilities for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project 
at december   the outstanding contracts represented approximately six per cent of the total expected spending in canadian dollars for the related assets 
for the period from january  through march   we entered into additional forward currency contracts for the voisey s bay project 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into additional forward currency contracts in respect of our voisey s bay project in the future 
at march   we had  in aggregate  outstanding forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average rate of  representing per cent of the total expected capital expenditures in canadian dollars for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project 
we also had outstanding at december   forward currency contracts to purchase cdn 
million at an average exchange rate of during  the purpose of these contracts is to reduce the risk that the eventual us dollar cash flows relating to a portion of our future canadian production costs will be adversely affected by an appreciation of the canadian dollar 
we have experienced periods where the us dollar has been relatively strong in relation to the canadian dollar for example  in and  more recently  when the us dollar has been relatively weak in relation to the canadian dollar for example  in 
historically  the positive correlation between the canadian dollar and 
table of contents metal prices has resulted in higher profit margins for us during periods when the canadian dollar has been relatively strong against the us dollar 
therefore  while a stronger canadian dollar has historically led to higher cash operating costs in us dollar terms  the historical accompanying increase in metal prices has resulted in higher profit margins 
conversely  historically when the canadian dollar has weakened relative to the us dollar we have experienced lower cash operating costs in us dollar terms and the historical accompanying decrease in metal prices has resulted in lower profit margins for us 
due to this correlation and the historical responsiveness of nickel prices to cyclical supply demand factors  we do not currently anticipate that the impact of fluctuations in the canadian dollar will affect the quantities of our estimated proven and probable ore reserves given how we determine the metal prices and exchange rates we use in estimating these proven and probable ore reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that the historical correlation between the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar and metal prices will continue and if it fails to do so our estimates of proven and probable ore reserves could be adversely affected by a significant strengthening of the canadian dollar compared with the us dollar 
to the extent that we would use other expected metal prices and exchange rates for our estimated proven and probable ore reserves  these estimates could change significantly 
while we use the us dollar as the functional currency in our canadian operations  we are required  for income tax purposes  to report income subject to canadian tax in canadian dollars 
we have a number of long term debt obligations denominated in currencies other than canadian dollars 
fluctuations in the value of the relevant foreign currencies in relation to the canadian dollar can give rise to capital gains or losses for canadian income tax purposes on the repayment of any such foreign currency denominated long term debt obligations 
since the us dollar is both our functional and reporting currency  no gains or losses on the settlement or marking to market of us dollar based obligations representing the primary dollar denomination of our long term debt obligations is reported in computing income reported in our consolidated financial statements 
for reporting purposes  we reflect the canadian taxes potentially payable on the settlement of our non canadian dollar denominated debt in computing our long term deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrealized gains and losses and as a current tax expense for realized gains and losses 
no taxable event in respect of the debt occurs until the debt is settled by payment or other form of discharge for canadian tax purposes 
should a fluctuation in the value between the canadian dollar and the relevant foreign currencies result in us being subject to reporting a capital gain for canadian income tax purposes when a debt were repaid  we would report as either a current tax expense in respect of realized gains  or a deferred tax expense in respect of unrealized gains  for the canadian income taxes payable in respect of such a gain 
this increase in our tax provision may distort our effective tax rate  since no such foreign currency gain would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates results from investing and borrowing activities undertaken to manage our liquidity and capital requirements 
we generally have used fixed rate debt to finance long term investments  while variable rate debt has been used to meet working capital requirements and related requirements on a more near term basis 
at december   taking into account our interest rate swaps discussed below  approximately per cent of our total debt  or million  was subject to variable interest rates 
based upon the level of floating or variable rate debt at december   the impact of a per cent change in interest rates  or basis points  would change interest expense by about million over a full year 
as noted under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources compared with above  we may be required to raise additional debt in the future and  accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes in interest rates in the future despite any interest rate swaps we might then have in effect 
as at december   we had an outstanding interest rate swap of a notional principal amount of million on our debentures due  whereby we receive a fixed rate of interest of and pay a floating rate at over month libor 
we also had an interest rate swap of a notional principal amount of million on our notes due  whereby we receive a fixed rate of interest of and pay a floating rate at over month libor 

table of contents counterparty risk our interest rate swaps  metals hedging and foreign currency risk management activities expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such arrangements 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support derivative instruments subject to credit risk but mitigate this risk by dealing only with counterparties that we believe  based upon an assessment of each such counterparty s financial history and experience  to be financially sound and  accordingly  we do not anticipate a loss for non performance by any counterparty with whom we have a commercial relationship 
environmental risk environmental legislation and regulations affect nearly all aspects of our operations worldwide 
such legislation and regulations apply to us along with other companies in the mining and metals industry 
these types of legislation and regulations require us to obtain operating licences  permits and other approvals and impose standards and controls on activities relating to mining  exploration  development  production  closure and the refining  distribution and marketing of nickel and other metal products 
environmental assessments are required before initiating most new projects or undertaking significant changes to existing operations 
in addition to current requirements  we expect that additional environmental regulations will likely be implemented to protect the environment and quality of life  given issues of sustainable development and other similar requirements which governmental and supragovernmental organizations and other bodies have been pursuing 
some of the issues currently under review by environmental regulatory agencies include i further reductions in  or requiring enhanced stabilization of  various emissions  including sulphur dioxide  metal and greenhouse gas emissions  ii additional mine reclamation and restoration  and iii more restrictive water  air and soil quality and waste treatment and disposal 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard of the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica relating to asset retirement obligations 
this standard significantly changed the method of accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to earnings 
in addition  the asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the asset s carrying value and depreciated over the asset s useful life 
the estimate of the total liability for asset retirement obligations has been developed from independent environmental studies  which include an evaluation of  among other factors  information available at that time with respect to closure plans and closure alternatives  the anticipated method and extent of site restoration using current costs and existing technology  and compliance required by presently enacted laws  regulations and existing industry standards 
the total liability for asset retirement obligations represents estimated expenditures associated with closure  progressive rehabilitation and post closure care and maintenance 
potential recoveries of funds from the future sale of assets upon the ultimate closure of operations have not been reflected in the estimate of the total liability or related annual provision 
future changes  if any  to the estimated total liability  as a result of changes in requirements  laws  regulations and operating assumptions may be significant and would be recognized prospectively as a change in accounting estimate  when applicable 
although the ultimate amount to be incurred is uncertain  the total liability for asset retirement obligations in respect of our worldwide operations to be incurred primarily after cessation of operations was estimated to be million at december  based upon certain discount rates and timing with respect to when these costs would be expected to be incurred applied in accordance with the new accounting standard previously discussed 
changes made in to mining regulations in the province of ontario require us to provide letters of credit or other forms of financial security to fund our future reclamation and restoration costs  which are not expected to be incurred for many years  if we were to no longer meet certain minimum investment grade credit ratings for our outstanding publicly traded debt securities 
although our debt securities are currently rated investment grade  they were rated below investment grade in recent times and there can be no assurance that this situation will not reoccur 
if we are not able to maintain the minimum investment grade credit ratings  it is currently estimated that letters of credit or other forms of financial security associated with the currently estimated costs of the eventual future closure of our mines and other facilities in ontario would have to cover a significant portion of such closure costs 
due to the closure of three mines in ontario  in we were required under such mining regulations to provide letters of credit in the amount of million to secure these near term closure costs as 
table of contents discussed below 
in addition  we are subject to certain indonesian regulations which require us to provide security for the reclamation of land areas that have been mined 
in the case of our manitoba operations  in we submitted closure and reclamation plans for all our operations in that province 
we expect that  based upon regulations in the province of manitoba  we will be required to provide some form of financial security for our future reclamation and restoration costs in that province 
however  it is not currently expected that these costs with respect to our manitoba operations for manitoba s recently submitted closure plan beyond what has been included in the million consolidated liability referred to above and for our indonesian operations and or such financial security to be provided for our manitoba operations will be of a material amount 
these potential costs might not be incurred until many years in the future 
if these requirements for letters of credit or other forms of financial security had to be satisfied  they could have an adverse effect on the amounts available for borrowing by us under our credit facilities 
in february  the ontario government issued a control order that requires us to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by per cent at our ontario smelting operations by the end of we are currently moving forward with an investment of approximately million in fluid bed roaster off gas scrubbing technology intended to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions to the new levels mandated by this new control order by the end of as part of the control order  we will also be required to i reduce ground level concentrations of sulphur dioxide  ii continue research into the technology and economics of further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions and iii report annually to the ontario ministry of the environment and the public on the progress of this research program 
the control order calls for a final report on achieving the additional reductions to be submitted by december  we do not currently expect that compliance with the annual sulphur dioxide emission levels from our smelter operations or ground level concentration levels as set forth in the control order will have any significant effect on our costs  operating procedures or annual production of nickel and other primary metals from our ontario operations 
in february  the province of ontario issued a discussion paper covering proposals for further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions by non ferrous smelting operations  including our operations 
the federal government of canada has also recently designated for further regulation certain sulphur dioxide and particulate emissions from copper smelting operations such as those we have in ontario 
to this end  the canadian federal government has proposed  on an informal basis  certain initiatives which would be applicable to metals processing operations in canada  including us  that would have the effect of requiring operators such as us to prepare and submit a plan outlining measures to be taken to reduce these emissions to meet specified levels 
while we do not currently believe that these initiatives will be put into effect  if they did come into effect as proposed they would require us to commit to material additional capital expenditures and or significantly reduce our production of nickel and certain other metals by as early as while we are not able to determine the effect  if any  of these recent developments and significant future changes in regulatory emission limits and other environmental laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and ultimate form that such changes may take  any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million to secure a portion of our closure costs related to the closure of three mines in ontario 
these letters of credit have a term of one year and will automatically renew without any action by either inco or the counterparty until the earlier of i inco having complied with the terms of the certified closure plans or ii funds from such letters of credit being utilized by the ontario ministry of northern development and mines  the ministry responsible for overseeing such closure plans  to perform rehabilitation work if we did not meet the requirements with respect to such closure plans 
we are required to submit annual updates on changes to the closure plans  including any decommissioning and rehabilitation work completed during the previous year 
we have also provided letters of credit or similar forms of financial assurance to secure future closure costs associated with our voisey s bay project and certain other operations or projects in north america and elsewhere which currently have  or are expected to have  fairly extended useful lives 
canada signed and ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change kyoto protocol in december the kyoto protocol calls for significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide  and nationwide ceilings on such emissions 
in november  the federal government of canada released an initiative to address certain causes of climate changes 
the 
table of contents specific requirement of this initiative is also to limit the discharge of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
neither the kyoto protocol nor this other initiative has as yet established what the specific allocation of reductions among various sources of greenhouse gases would be 
in august  the federal government of canada released certain principles covering the kyoto protocol intended to be used to implement the objective of having the oil and gas  thermal energy and mining and manufacturing sectors reduce greenhouse gases by certain specified limits 
while the precise impact on our operations in canada and the operations of others who provide energy or other products or services to us is uncertain at this time  we anticipate that compliance with these initiatives could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and costs 
in  the danish environmental protection agency  as part of the authority granted to it under certain environmental regulations of the european union commission  published draft risk assessment reports  including certain conclusions concerning potential human health hazards associated with nickel metal and certain soluble nickel compounds  including nickel sulphate  nickel chloride and nickel nitrate 
this agency determined  based on certain animal studies  that soluble nickel is a reproductive toxin and has proposed certain product labeling requirements as a result of this determination 
it has also assessed certain other environmental issues 
in addition  based upon these draft reports and taking into consideration certain studies  this agency has proposed that soluble nickel be classified under its hazard classification system as a known human carcinogen 
during  the european union commission released draft sections of their risk assessment focussing on the characterization of certain forms of nickel and the related human health assessment 
this risk assessment is currently expected to be completed in the study of the socio economic effects of such risk assessment also moved forward in before any such proposed classification could come into effect  a number of regulatory and administrative steps would have to be completed 
if this proposed classification were to come into effect as currently proposed  it could result in use restrictions and other requirements which could have a material adverse impact on certain producers and end users of the forms of nickel covered by such classification and on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the european union commission also in proposed a directive on air pollution which includes target limit values for nickel since nickel is considered by this commission to be a possible carcinogenic pollutant 
member states of the european union will have until to achieve the target limit values  after which more stringent binding limit values may be considered 
the technical and socio economic feasibility of meeting such limits are currently being considered by the european union commission and those industries that would be affected  including nickel producers 
further changes in environmental laws  the restrictions on our discharge of greenhouse gases as a result of canada s program to comply with the kyoto protocol and similar developments that may be imposed  new information on existing environmental conditions and other events  including legal proceedings brought based upon such conditions or an inability to obtain necessary permits  could require increased accounting reserves or compliance or other expenditures or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
other changes in environmental legislation could have a material adverse effect on product demand  product quality and methods of production and distribution 
the complexity and breadth of these issues make it extremely difficult to predict their future impact on us 
we anticipate capital expenditures and operating expenses will increase in the future as a result of the implementation of existing and new and increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  liability for clean up costs  damages and the loss of important permits 
there can be no assurance that we will at all times be in compliance with all environmental regulations or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we may also be subject to claims from persons alleging that they have suffered significant damages as a result of the environmental impact of our operations  including facilities that have ceased to operate for many years 

table of contents other risks and uncertainties pt inco our investment in pt inco at book value as of december  totalled million 
in addition  a lender to pt inco currently has the right  under certain circumstances  to require one of our wholly owned subsidiaries to purchase approximately million in debt extended to pt inco by that lender 
for  pt inco s production is expected to represent about of our total planned production 
in  to meet pt inco s cash shortfalls attributable principally to the increase in the capital cost of the new hydroelectric facilities which were part of pt inco s expansion project  the relatively low nickel prices  and constraints on pt inco s production attributable to then reduced hydroelectric power generation caused by below average rainfall  we advanced million to pt inco 
these advances have since been repaid 
to the extent that pt inco would experience cash shortfalls in the future  particularly if there were to be a significant decline in primary nickel demand and nickel prices  we may again conclude that it would be necessary to advance cash to pt inco in order to meet pt inco s cash needs 
the uncertain political situation and security concerns in indonesia  primarily as a result of the ongoing economic  political and social problems facing that country  could adversely affect pt inco s ability to operate 
while there has been no indication that the government of the republic of indonesia is considering currency controls  nationalization of certain properties or facilities or other similar actions  regional and local governmental authorities have sought to take greater control of the development of their resources and these or other political developments  including  but not limited to  the possibility of disruptions in pt inco s operations arising out of the actions of non governmental organizations or community activist groups  could have a material adverse effect on pt inco s  and our overall nickel production levels  business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
risks associated with  and importance of  future low cost nickel projects as part of our strategy to be the world s lowest cost and most profitable nickel producer  we have continued our efforts to develop new low cost sources of nickel 
following the completion of the pt inco expansion project in late  we have focused  as discussed above  on future projects to commercialize our goro nickel cobalt project and our voisey s bay nickel copper cobalt project 
a number of risks and uncertainties are associated with the development of these projected low cost sources of nickel and other metals  including political  regulatory  design  construction  labour  operating  technical and technological risks  uncertainties relating to capital and other costs and financing risks and  in the case of goro  risks related to the possible future transition to independence of new caledonia 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties referred to above  there are certain issues that must be resolved to enable the commercial development of each of these projects to proceed 
for the goro project  we still need to receive the necessary environmental and operating permits  complete the second phase  or phase two  of our comprehensive review focusing on the project schedule  capital costs  scope  execution plan and other key aspects of this project and develop an acceptable updated capital cost estimate to enable us to reach a decision as to whether or not to proceed with the project as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below and  as further discussed below  arrange the required financing  including obtaining certain financial support from the government of france and other direct or indirect financial assistance under other government sponsored programs and bringing in a partner for the project  in each case on acceptable terms 
in the case of our voisey s bay project  certain preliminary work on site during the second half of was completed and the start of commercial development of the project began essentially in july construction and other work on site was carried out as planned in as part of the current schedule to achieve commercial production in we have not received all of the necessary construction and operating permits we will need for this project 
while we currently anticipate that we will be able to obtain all such remaining permits on a timely basis  any failure to obtain  or delay in the issuance of  such permits could adversely affect the construction or start up of the project 
in addition  we will need to continue to meet the terms and conditions under the definitive agreements covering the development of the voisey s bay project reached in october between the government of newfoundland 
table of contents and labrador and us  including the construction of a demonstration plant to test hydrometallurgical processing technologies expected to be completed and in operation in depending upon the levels of cash flows we are able to generate  we may also need to secure financing for the completion of the development of the three phases of the voisey s bay project on acceptable terms 
in connection with raising the significant financing which may be required for the commercial development of the goro and voisey s bay projects  we currently expect that  in order to be able to meet such financing needs  we could be required to borrow additional funds and or issue additional debt and or equity or arrange other forms of financing and or enter into strategic or other arrangements 
our current plans for development of goro include obtaining at least approximately million in tax advantaged financing under an existing french legislative program and certain additional direct or indirect financial assistance under other government sponsored programs 
our current plans also contemplate reaching an agreement under which a japanese consortium to be led by sumitomo metal mining co  ltd 
would acquire up to a per cent interest in goro and assume  subject to certain limitations  the obligation to fund their pro rata share of the capital costs of the goro project 
there can be no assurance that these financing and investment arrangements will be completed or that we will be able to raise additional required funds on acceptable terms when financing is needed for either project 
as discussed under uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates below  while we have certain potential new mine development projects at our existing operations in canada  as well as additional resources that could be developed in indonesia  in addition to the voisey s bay and goro projects  if sufficient new low cost sources of nickel are not developed by us on a timely basis  we currently believe that our overall nickel production  particularly at our manitoba operations  could decline beginning as early as  and our unit cost of production could increase significantly with any material decline in mine production from our ontario and manitoba operations if such operations were not significantly restructured 
these developments could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates a decrease in the amount of and a change in the timing of our production outlook for the metals we produce  in particular nickel  will directly impact the amount and timing of cash flows 
a per cent reduction in the amount of consolidated planned production of all metals produced would decrease cash flows estimated for by approximately million based on metal prices and costs at december  the actual impact of such a decrease on cash flows would depend on the timing and extent of any changes in prices and costs 
in the case of our canadian and united kingdom operations  the time from initial production to collection of cash from the sale of nickel products produced by these operations is approximately weeks  while the time between production of copper and cash collection from copper sales is about weeks 
the production of most of our precious metals requires the transfer of precious metals containing materials to our acton refinery in the united kingdom and the processing time at that facility generally results in cash collection taking about weeks from first production of such materials in our ontario operations 
in the case of pt inco  the time between nickel in matte production  refining of that intermediate product through our asian refineries and collection of cash from the sale of such refined products is approximately weeks 
a change in these cash flows that would occur due to production shortfalls or labour disruptions would result in delays in cash flows and using such cash to reduce debt levels and may require additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures  including for our development projects  in the future 
in addition  a number of these and other developments or events  including changes in credit terms  product mix  demand for our products and production disruptions  could make historic trends in our cash flows lose their predictive value 
the level of production and capital and operating cost estimates relating to our goro and voisey s bay projects and other projects  which are used in establishing ore mineral reserve estimates and for determining and obtaining financing and other purposes  are based on certain assumptions and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
it is very likely that actual results for our voisey s bay and goro projects will differ from our current estimates and assumptions  and these differences may be material 
in addition  as discussed below  experience from actual mining or processing operations may identify new or unexpected conditions which could reduce production below  and or increase capital and or operating costs above  our current estimates 
if actual 
table of contents results are less favorable than we currently estimate  our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely impacted 
goro in september  at the time our goro project was experiencing certain labour disruptions  we initiated a review of the status of certain key aspects of the project  including the necessary permitting  capital cost estimate  schedule and organization 
work on the project was generally curtailed over the september november period but work on certain critical parts of the project  including engineering  continued during this initial review 
in early december  we announced that we would be undertaking a comprehensive review of the goro project 
the comprehensive review was commenced in response to information we received from the principal firms then providing project engineering  procurement and construction management services that  if confirmed  would indicate an increase in the capital cost for the project in the range of to per cent above the then current capital cost estimate of  million 
the objective of the comprehensive review was to assess all information on our goro project  including the various cost estimates and trends  and determine what changes in the capital cost estimate and the project could be made to maintain the project s economic feasibility 
as a result of the temporary suspension of certain development activities and other actions which had been taken by year end during this review process  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge was comprised of pre tax expenses of million relating to the cancellation or termination of certain outstanding contractual obligations  to accrue for demobilization costs and to reduce the carrying value of certain assets relating to the project  partially offset by currency gains of million as a result of the ineffectiveness of certain forward currency contracts that had been entered into for hedging purposes 
as part of the comprehensive review  we also evaluated various contractual and other arrangements covering construction and other work relating to the goro project and implemented certain actions to suspend or terminate certain of those contractual arrangements 
as the comprehensive review of the goro project that began in december moved forward during  it evolved into two phases 
the first or initial phase  which was completed in july  focused on the identification of issues that had resulted in  or created  actual or potential increases in capital costs and how those issues could be addressed and other actions that could be taken to reduce these costs 
on august   we announced the results of the initial phase of the review 
the second phase  or phase two  which began essentially in august  is intended to evaluate further opportunities to reduce costs and develop  among other key deliverables  a new capital cost control estimate  project scope and schedule and execution plan for the project 
while one of our objectives of phase two of our review is to have a capital cost estimate for the project of billion  the conclusion of that review could result in a capital cost estimate higher than this objective 
as of december   we had spent approximately million on the goro project since july  when this project was formally launched 
this amount excludes a current estimate of approximately million that would still have to be spent for equipment  services and other requirements under existing contracts and commitments  and accruals of approximately million relating to such requirements as of december  we currently believe that  based upon the focus on certain potential new approaches to construction as part of  and the expected results of  the phase two review as it moves to completion  we will be required to take additional non cash charges beyond those taken in the fourth quarter of but we cannot predict at this time the amount of such non cash charges and whether they will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
while the key objective of phase two of the review is to have a project that will produce an acceptable rate of return on the investment to be made in this project  if  upon completion of this phase of the review  we were to conclude that the goro project could not proceed or be restructured to meet our rate of return on investment requirements  we currently expect that we would undertake a further evaluation to determine how the project could be restructured to provide an acceptable return on the investment to be made 
depending upon the timing of the completion of such further evaluation  or if that further evaluation did not occur or did not result in achieving an acceptable return  we would likely write off all or a substantial portion of the carrying value of the goro project  approximately million at december   and we would also lose the expected future 
table of contents production from goro 
such a result would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
operations during  as mine production at our manitoba operations transitioned from the thompson mine to the lower grade birchtree mine  we experienced lower mine production 
we continued to experience such lower mine production in and  as this transition continues to move forward  we currently expect to see a continuing decline in mine production in manitoba in and expect to see further declines in future years 
we have recently been relying upon  and expect that we will continue to rely  on an increasing basis  upon the availability of purchased intermediates to maintain manitoba s nickel production at around the  tonne annual level in while we have entered into agreements and other arrangements to purchase intermediates to maintain manitoba s production levels at or near the  tonne annual level for the next few years  until the voisey s bay project produces intermediates in the form of concentrates for further processing at our manitoba and ontario operations  if suppliers of the purchased intermediates were to experience production problems or other disruptions which would adversely affect their supply of such intermediates to us or reduce their shipments of concentrate below our requirements  this could have a material adverse effect on our nickel production  business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
voisey s bay we announced in late march i the results of our bankable feasibility study for the mine and concentrator for the ovoid and adjacent surface deposits and related facilities representing part of the initial phase of the voisey s bay project and ii that we planned to proceed with this initial phase 
based upon the results of the study  the estimated total capital cost for the mine and  tonne per day concentrator and related facilities representing the mine  concentrator and related facilities and infrastructure in the voisey s bay area the mine concentrator project was estimated to be million  including million spent since july on infrastructure and related work 
the million amount represented an increase of million or about per cent over the prefeasibility study estimates for the mine concentrator project 
this estimate included a million contingency 
the initial phase of the voisey s bay project will also involve a research and development program covering hydrometallurgical processing technologies the hydromet r d program for the treatment of the voisey s bay nickel and cobalt containing concentrates to be produced into finished nickel and cobalt product  including a demonstration plant to be constructed in argentia  newfoundland 
in march of  the hydromet r d program was expected to cost approximately million or about per cent above the initial estimate for this program 
it is possible that the cost of this program may be higher but we cannot currently predict what the increase in such cost will be 
in addition to the mine concentrator project and the hydromet r d program  the initial phase will include handling facilities to be constructed at our canadian operations for the nickel and cobalt containing concentrates to be processed over the period once the mine concentrator project and the demonstration plant are in operation  at an estimated cost of million  and an exploration program at an estimated cost of million 
the total capital cost estimate for all four parts of the initial phase of the voisey s bay project is million  or about per cent above the original estimate of million 
the engineering firm retained to complete the study indicated that it believed that the capital cost estimate was within a range of plus per cent and minus per cent of the million figure to be spent on a going forward basis for the mine concentrator project 
given that we currently expect that a significant portion of these costs will be incurred in canadian dollars  we have entered into canadian dollar hedges for approximately per cent of the total expected capital expenditures in canadian dollars for the related assets  including cdn 
million of hedges at an average exchange rate of which had been entered into as at march  the million estimate assumed a canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate of approximately cdn 
to 
at exchange rates in effect at march   taking into consideration the forward currency contracts noted above  this estimate would be million 
to the extent that this currency exposure is not hedged at exchange rates equivalent to this assumed rate  then this capital cost estimate could rise  adversely affecting the projected returns on our investment in this project 

table of contents construction risks and technological risks the mine  processing plant and related infrastructure required for development of the goro and voisey s bay projects have not yet been constructed and no commercial mining has commenced 
while construction of the initial phase of the voisey s bay project began in and certain necessary construction and other permits have been obtained in respect of the goro and voisey s bay projects and detailed exploration and related studies with respect to the goro project and a portion of the voisey s bay project have been completed based on significant surface exploratory drilling  extensive investigations of certain of the mineralization delineated to date  construction and mine plans  and production and cost estimates  we are not currently in a position to predict when all of the required approvals would be in place for us to develop either project and  in the case of the goro project  when construction  beyond the million in limited interim construction work we currently plan to complete in early during phase two of our review of that project  would be restarted given the current timetable for the completion and results of such phase two as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties uncertainty of production and capital and other cost estimates above  currently being undertaken  and  in the case of the voisey s bay project  when construction will be completed 
depending on the severity of winter conditions and other factors applicable to the voisey s bay project  a period of approximately months from site mobilization will be required to complete construction of the initial phase after all necessary approvals and permits have been secured 
after completion of certain preliminary work on site during the second half of  construction and related work  including site mobilization  for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project began in july and  as discussed above  we met our targets for construction work to be completed in unforeseen conditions or developments could arise during the construction period for either project which could delay or prevent completion  and or substantially increase the cost of construction of the necessary facilities and infrastructure to develop the goro and the voisey s bay projects 
such events may include  without limitation  shortages of equipment  materials or labour  delays in delivery of equipment or materials  labour disruptions  political events  local or political opposition  civil disturbances  litigation  adverse weather conditions  unanticipated increases in costs  natural or man made disasters  accidents and unforeseen engineering  technical and technological  design  environmental  geological or geotechnical problems 
any delay in construction would delay the production of nickel and other products from the goro and or the voisey s bay projects  and the expected significant source of revenue for us that production from these projects would represent 
any such delay could also materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our goro project will involve the application of new processing and other technologies and  depending upon the results of the hydromet r d program we plan to conduct for our voisey s bay project  as described above  that project could also utilize new processing and other technologies to produce one or more refined or finished nickel products 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will be successfully developed and applied on a commercial basis or that the costs associated with and or the timing of their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on the timing of the start up of commercial production  the capital and or operating costs for either or both projects and on other factors impacting the profitability of these projects 
these events could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
governmental regulations in addition to environmental regulations referred to above  the mining and metals industry in canada operates under federal  provincial and municipal legislation  regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as land tenure  limitations on areas in which mining can be conducted  production rates  income and other taxes and the export of ore and other products  as well as other matters 
our operations in indonesia  the united kingdom  new caledonia and in other countries outside canada are also subject to various environmental and other applicable laws and regulations and governmental interventions  some of which are similar to those in canada and all of which are subject to change 
the mining and metals industry is also subject to regulation and intervention by governments in such matters as control over the development and abandonment of mine sites including restrictions on production and possible expropriation or cancellation of contract and mineral rights 
before proceeding with major projects  including significant changes to existing operations  we must obtain regulatory approvals 
the regulatory approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact 
table of contents assessments and public hearings  among other things 
in addition  regulatory approvals may be subject to conditions  including the obligation to post security deposits and other financial commitments 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays and abandonment or restructuring of projects and increased costs  all of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flows 
in addition  such regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and the implementation of new regulations or the modification of existing regulations affecting the mining and metals industry could increase our costs and have a material adverse impact on business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with all applicable statutes or regulations at all times or that steps to bring us into compliance would not materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
reference is made to risks and uncertainties environmental risks above 
capital requirements and operating risks as discussed under cash flows  liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments above  each of our two current principal primary metals business units  the canadian and united kingdom operations and pt inco  has required  and is expected to continue to require  certain levels of investment to sustain their current levels of production 
for  as discussed under outlook planned capital expenditures and production below  we currently forecast capital expenditures totalling approximately  million for  covering sustaining capital for our current primary metals business units as well as planned expenditures for our goro and voisey s bay projects and other development projects 
this total amount assumes a level of capital expenditures for our goro project of million  which may be higher or lower depending upon the results of the second phase of the review process referred to under results of operations compared with goro project suspension costs above and assuming that we decide to proceed with the project in the summer of  and other developments  and million for the initial phase of our voisey s bay project 
to meet such capital expenditures requirements for and at least until given the current projected expenditure for our two development projects  we must generate sufficient internal cash flows and or be able to utilize available financing sources 
in addition  our mining operations and processing and related infrastructure facilities are subject to risks normally encountered in the mining and metals industry 
such risks include  without limitation  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  labour disputes  changes in laws  technical difficulties or failures  late delivery of supplies or equipment  unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures  cave ins  pit wall failures  rock falls  unanticipated ground  grade or water conditions  flooding  periodic or extended interruptions due to the unavailability of materials and force majeure events 
such risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or producing facilities  personal injury  environmental damage  delays in mining or processing  losses and possible legal liability 
any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining or processing operations could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the wholesale electricity markets in ontario were deregulated for a portion of and as a result we experienced fluctuations in some of our electricity costs at the ontario operations 
depending upon future changes in the regulatory environment for these markets  we could experience future fluctuations in such costs 
we have from time to time experienced adverse production and production cost trends at our operations in canada and elsewhere and could experience similar adverse trends in the future 
labour relations collective agreements with unionized hourly production and maintenance workers at our ontario operations ended on may  we were not able to negotiate new collective agreements by that date and these workers went on strike  with the strike lasting until august  when new collective agreements expiring on may  were entered into by the company and the local unions representing these workers 
this strike had a material adverse effect on our production of nickel  copper and certain other metals and results of operations  profitability and cash flows for a three year collective agreement with our unionized office  
table of contents clerical and technical employees at our ontario operations remains in effect until march  while preliminary negotiations covering a new collective agreement with these employees have been held  we cannot predict whether a new agreement will be entered into without a labour disruption 
we do not believe that such a disruption would have an adverse effect on production at our ontario operations 
on september   a new three year collective agreement with our unionized workers at our manitoba operations was successfully negotiated 
our pt inco subsidiary entered into a new two year collective labour agreement with its union in january which expires in december while there were no significant problems in reaching this latest agreement with pt inco s labour force  with the increased potential for actions of non government organizations and other activist groups  the current uncertain economic and political situation in indonesia and the general increase in labour activism in that country  there can be no assurance that such activism will not adversely affect pt inco s ability to successfully operate 
any disruption in pt inco s operations as a result of labour issues or other issues may adversely affect its operations and could materially adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
at goro  we currently have two unions representing some of our employees 
in early september  goro experienced labour disruptions by personnel associated with certain project construction subcontractors 
as a result of these disruptions  the decision was made in late september to curtail certain activities at the project s site to enable the project company  goro nickel sa  contractors  subcontractors and other interested parties to develop procedures to avoid future disruptions 
a number of procedures were put in place prior to the start of the comprehensive review in early december and we have been seeking to complete the implementation of these and other procedures as part of the negotiation of labour  site or other  accords to help minimize any such disruptions in the future 
through an employer s association  of which we are the controlling member  we negotiated a collective agreement effective september covering the construction of the first phase of the voisey s bay project 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain positive relationships with our employees at our operations in canada and elsewhere or that new collective agreements will be entered into without work interruptions as in the case of the three month strike at our ontario operations in we could also be adversely affected by labour disruptions involving third parties who may provide us with goods or services at our operations in canada and elsewhere 
for example  as discussed above  our goro project experienced labour disruptions by certain employees of the project s construction subcontractors 
strikes and other labour disruptions at any of our operations and lengthy work interruptions at our goro or voisey s bay projects could materially adversely affect the timing of completion and the cost of either project  as well as our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
uncertainty of ore reserve estimates our reported ore reserves as of december  are estimated quantities of proven and probable ore that  under present and anticipated conditions  can be legally and economically mined and processed by the extraction of their mineral content 
we determine the amount of our ore reserves in accordance with the requirements of the applicable securities regulatory authorities and established industry practices 
to the extent that we are required by regulatory authorities to change the metal prices  expenditures and other assumptions we use in preparing these estimates  then these estimates could change significantly 
the volume and grade of reserves actually recovered and rates of production from our present ore reserves may be less than geological measurements of the reserves 
furthermore  market price fluctuations in nickel  other metals and exchange rates  and changes in operating and capital costs may in the future render certain ore reserves uneconomic to mine and result in significant reductions in our reported estimates of proven and probable ore reserves 
no assurance can be given that the indicated amount of ore will be recovered or that it will be recovered at the rates anticipated by us 
our ore reserve estimates are based on limited sampling and  consequently  are uncertain because the samples may not be representative of the entire orebody 
as more knowledge and understanding of the orebody is obtained  the reserve estimates may change significantly  either positively or negatively 

table of contents sensitivities our financial results are sensitive to  among other things  changes in prices for nickel and other metals  the canadian us dollar exchange rate and interest rates 
our financial results are also affected by changes in the indonesian rupiah us dollar exchange rate  but to a lesser extent since pt inco s revenues and many of its expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we have changed our methodology to calculate the impact on our basic net earnings per share of a per cent change in the market risk exposures that we believe have the most significant impact on our net earnings 
based on this methodology  the following table shows the approximate full year impact of a per cent change in our principal market risk exposures on our basic net earnings per share based on planned deliveries of inco source metals and after taking into consideration our principal derivative instrument positions as of december  these market risk exposures have been selected as management believes they have had  and are currently expected to continue to have  the most significant impact on our net earnings per share impact on basic net earnings sensitivities as of december  change per share metals nickel per pound copper per pound cobalt per pound platinum per troy ounce palladium per troy ounce energy fuel oil per bbl natural gas per mm btu currencies us per cdn cents us per indonesian rupiah per thousand cents share appreciation rights per share canadian gaap basic net earnings per share 
each sensitivity assumes other factors are held constant 
as indicated in the table above  the most significant sensitivities in terms of the effect on our basic net earnings per share are nickel prices and the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
cash expenditures for our development projects will be incurred primarily in canadian dollars for our voisey s bay project and in australian dollars and euros for our goro project 
although changes in these currencies will affect the ultimate carrying value of the related assets in us dollar terms  they will not have any impact on our earnings until such projects are fully developed and have achieved commercial start up when they will be subject to depreciation in accordance with our depreciation policy reference is made to note to our consolidated financial statements 
a per cent change in each of the value of the australian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar as at december  would change currently planned capital expenditures for the goro project  assuming that a decision to proceed with the project is made in the summer of  by million and million  respectively  after taking into consideration outstanding derivative contracts as at december  a per cent change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar at december  would change planned capital expenditures for the voisey s bay project by million after taking into consideration outstanding derivative instruments as at december  after taking into consideration the additional forward currency contracts entered into during the january  to march  period in respect of the voisey s bay project  a per cent change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar at december  would change planned capital expenditures for the voisey s bay project by million

each sensitivity assumes other factors are held constant 
while the sensitivity analyses presented in the tables above represent our best estimate of the impact of specified assumed changes in the identified market risk scenarios  actual results could differ from those reflected 
the sensitivity analyses presented are subject to various limitations and uncertainties which may affect the impact on basic net earnings per share 
these sensitivity analyses have been prepared based on a change of per cent in the market rates or prices at december  and the impact on basic net earnings per share has been determined based on discrete changes in the identified risks 
if there are changes in two or more of the identified risks  the above impact on basic net earnings per share may not accurately reflect the actual impact on our net earnings per share 
these sensitivity analyses also include assumptions relating to our then projected operations during in the case of the sensitivity analyses as of december  and during in the case of the sensitivity analysis as of december  as we are affected and influenced by changes in the business and economic environments in which we operate  the changes reflected in the sensitivity analyses above may be different or may prove to be inaccurate  including in relation to their impact on basic net earnings per share 
the most significant assumptions which may be affected relate to levels of production  consumption rates  forecasted costs of production  tax rates and deliveries 
these sensitivity analyses provided are not intended to fully reflect the net market risk exposures since certain exposures would encompass events that are uncertain or could not be foreseen 
some of these events are outlined in our discussion above on risks and uncertainties affecting our business 
for example  with respect to metal prices  extended declines in prices  particularly nickel prices  due to unusual economic developments or other unforeseen events would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  unusual or irrational actions by competitors could  for example  change the nickel market supply demand relationship and other factors fundamental to our business causing declines in metal prices 
in addition  significant and prolonged increases in energy prices and or the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would have a material adverse effect on our costs of production  results of operations and financial condition 
there are also a wide range of other uncertainties in the business environment that could result in material limitations with respect to the accuracy of the sensitivity analyses for net market risk exposures  including cost inflation  relations with our employees  avoidance of major accidents at our producing locations  and the average grades of ore mined and the certainty of estimated proven and probable ore reserves at our operations 
unanticipated changes in environmental laws and regulations could also result in limits on production and or significantly increased capital spending to meet such changes

we entered into new swap arrangements in to manage the entire amount of the interest rate risk associated with our debentures due and our notes due off balance sheet financing arrangements in addition to the derivative instruments referred to under risks and uncertainties above  the off balance sheet financing arrangements we currently have in place involve accounts receivable securitized financing arrangements in the united states and japan with unrelated entities under which up to approximately million in eligible receivables may be sold by us to these entities at any time 
under these accounts receivable financing arrangements  a significant deterioration in our credit rating and or accounts receivable being sold could give the purchaser of such receivables the right not to renew the arrangements 
we have accounted for these securitizations as asset sales since their inception but have recorded where relevant any loss retention reserves with respect to the sale 
as at december   the aggregate amount of receivables sold was million 
we do not currently believe that our liquidity would be substantially reduced if these arrangements were not available to us 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our ongoing evaluation of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our consolidated financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by us 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting 
table of contents policies include inventories  property  plant and equipment  depreciation and depletion  asset impairment  asset retirement obligations  future employee benefits and income and mining taxes 
inventories we have substantial investments in inventories of finished metals and in process stocks 
the levels of finished metals inventories are generally driven by customer requirements and servicing commitments by our global marketing organization 
in process inventory levels are generally a function of operating requirements and include raw materials in transit 
inventories are costed based on average costs to produce  including all direct costs incurred through to the applicable stage of production such as labour and materials  depreciation and depletion  as well as an allocated portion of overheads 
the costing of metals produced at our ontario operations is primarily to establish values for metals in inventory and cost of sales 
copper and nickel are treated as co products and share expenses pro rata based on pounds produced unless a plant is specifically used for the upgrading of only one metal or the other 
common costs costs that are not separately identifiable to one metal incurred by nickel and copper mined are apportioned between the metals on the basis of tonnes of metal produced through the common mine and mill processes 
once expenditures are required to further finish a particular metal  all such expenditures are assigned to that metal 
the remaining metals cobalt and precious metals are by products and incur expenses only when some specific steps are taken towards their recovery 
co product costing for copper is used because of the significant quantities of copper contained in the ores at our ontario operations 
we do not have significant quantities of stockpiled ore on hand due to the integrated nature of our operations 
in addition  we do not use leach pads as a processing method at any of our operations 
property  plant and equipment canadian gaap contains an apparent conflict in the treatment of mineral rights with respect to balance sheet classification 
cica  business combinations  defines such assets as intangible assets  while cica  property  plant and equipment  defines acquired mineral rights as property  plant and equipment 
we have interpreted the adoption of cica and its companion statement  cica  goodwill and other intangible assets  in a manner that has led us to conclude that we are not required to change how we account for such mineral rights under canadian gaap 
in the united states  sfas no 
 business combinations  which is consistent with cica  requires that under united states gaap mineral rights are classified as intangible assets 
this matter has been referred to the emerging issues task force eitf of the united states financial accounting standards board for its consideration 
there can be no certainty as to the conclusions the eitf will reach  nor as to whether the apparent conflict under canadian gaap will be resolved 
for canadian gaap  we have classified such assets  less the related accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  as property  plant and equipment  net on our consolidated balance sheet 
the only significant mineral rights that have a carrying value on our balance sheet relate to the voisey s bay deposits acquired in for united states gaap purposes  with respect to this acquisition  the carrying value has been reclassified from property  plant and equipment to intangible assets on the balance sheet and comprises a gross carrying value balance of  million in and there is no impact on the amortization of the portion of the intangible asset value assigned to the estimated proven and probable ore reserves until commencement of mine production currently estimated to start in with respect to the portion of the intangible asset value assigned to the remainder of the deposit  the difference between the carrying value and the residual value is being amortized on a straight line basis over the period until estimated proven and probable ore reserves are established and underground development and mining are expected to commence 
this results in a pre tax annual charge to net earnings of million under united states gaap 

table of contents exploration properties we use a multi stage process to advance an exploration property from initial exploration through to the point of a development decision 
the initial stage or reconnaissance assessment includes a review of available information  mapping  initial drilling and possibly down hole geophysical surveys 
if no mineralization is intersected or low grade mineralization is intersected with limited potential  the program is stopped 
the second stage proceeds if mineralization is discovered of sufficient width and grade to indicate economic potential 
when sufficient drilling has been conducted  a geological model is constructed and the first estimate of the potential tonnage and grade is made 
scoping conceptual studies for engineering financial evaluations are also done 
this allows an initial order of magnitude evaluation to be completed 
if this initial evaluation is positive  further exploration work and infill drilling is conducted to provide sufficient information to establish a mineral resource estimate at the inferred classification 
this stage may take from one to three years depending on the depth of the deposit 
the third stage encompasses a preliminary feasibility assessment 
based on the geological model and geophysical information  certain areas are selected to carry out detailed drilling to assess the short range variability in the geometry and grade of the mineralization 
bench scale milling tests are also carried out as further infill drilling and a detailed geological model is then constructed for the deposit 
simulation models are also developed to assess mining method alternatives and grade control methods 
this process allows the selection of the mining method and processing design 
estimation of the mineral resources is performed and the development plan is finalized 
a preliminary feasibility study is then completed along with financial evaluations and estimates of ore reserves 
this stage usually takes two to three years to complete 
if the preliminary feasibility study is positive  work would then progress to the final stage where a final feasibility study is prepared 
this would involve detailed infill drilling of areas where initial production would occur  metallurgical pilot plant testing  geotechnical testing and modelling  construction of the final geological model and block models  layout of work places  detailed costing  financial evaluation and estimated ore reserves 
this final stage usually takes from one to two years 
the overall process can take from about four to ten years 
however  many factors impact the actual length of time required 
for example  open pit and laterite deposits near existing facilities take the shortest time  with sulphide deposits near existing facilities  generally in the mid range and new or greenfield projects  which require new facilities are in the longer time range 
in addition  the timing of commencement of the work can be impacted by the need for ore for production requirements 
exploration properties that contain estimated proven and probable ore reserves  but for which a development decision has not yet been taken  are subject to periodic review for impairment in accordance with our company s accounting policy when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying value may not be recoverable 
depreciation and depletion expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and depreciated using the declining balance or straight line method at rates sufficient to depreciate such costs over the estimated future lives of such facilities or equipment 
these lives do not exceed the estimated operating mine life based upon estimated proven and probable ore reserves unless we believe the asset can be utilized in another facility after the mining operations have ended 
costs relating to our operating mines include the cost of building access ways  shaft sinking and access  lateral development  drift development  ramps and infrastructure development 
all such costs are amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the orebody based on the anticipated production from our twenty year mine plan 
a per tonne amortization rate is estimated based on the net book value of the mine  anticipated capital costs to access the relevant estimated proven and probable ore reserves in our mine plan and estimated production from such estimated proven and probable ore reserves in our mine plan 
the amount of estimated proven and probable ore reserves at our operating mines is in excess of that currently anticipated to be produced in our present mine plan 
the calculation of the units of production rate of amortization and  accordingly  the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different 
table of contents from current forecasts of production based on estimated proven and probable ore reserves and forecast future capital expenditures 
this would generally be the case where there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating proven and probable ore reserves 
these factors could include i an expansion of estimated proven and probable ore reserves through exploration activities  ii differences between estimated and actual cash costs of mining  due to differences in grade  metal recovery rates and foreign currency exchange rates from those assumed  and iii differences between actual commodity prices and the commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of proven and probable ore reserves 
such changes in reserves could similarly impact the useful lives of assets depreciated on a straight line basis  where those lives are limited to the life of the mine 
the expected useful lives used in depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations are determined based on applicable facts and circumstances  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of useful lives and no assurance can be given that actual useful lives will not differ significantly from the useful lives assumed for purpose of depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations 
for united states gaap purposes  amortization of the deferred mine development costs is calculated on a unit of production basis over the estimated proven and probable ore reserves which relate to the particular category of development  either life of mine plan or area specific 
no future development costs are taken into account in calculating the amortization charge 
life of mine plan development comprises capital expenditures that will be utilized in the extraction of all the estimated proven and probable ore reserves in the current detailed mine plan 
these expenditures are predominantly incurred up front and in advance of any ore extraction or in advance of major expansions 
the types of development included in this category include ore haulage shafts  initial decline  ore passes  ventilation and chutes and underground ore crusher cavities and are intended to be used for the extraction of all ore within the current mine plan 
these costs are amortized on a unit of production basis over the total estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
area specific development costs  which are amortized over estimated proven and probable ore reserves for which no further capital is required  consist of capital expenditures to provide access to various areas within the mine to allow the extraction of ore to commence 
the types of development costs that are within this category include access and perimeter drives  ventilation drives and rises  and progressive declining subsequent to initial contact with the ore body 
these costs are amortized on a units of production basis over the estimated proven and probable ore reserves that can be currently accessed without future capital development costs being incurred 
ongoing mine development costs that provide access to ore for less than two years production are expensed as incurred 
for united states gaap purposes  we have restated pt inco s depreciation and depletion expense for the amortization of deferred mine development costs and changed the amortization of other assets from a unit of production to a straight line method over the lesser of the asset s useful life up to years in respect of mine and mobile equipment  the lesser of the asset s useful life and the term of the current contract of work that expires in in respect of roads  bridges and process plant buildings and equipment  and  in the case hydroelectric facilities  the lesser of the asset s useful life up to years 
for united states gaap purposes we have restated our depreciation and depletion expense for to conform to united states gaap described above 
as a result of this change  certain balance sheet accounts as of january  were restated as follows the deficit increased by million  property  plant and equipment increased by million  minority interest increased by million  and deferred income and mining taxes decreased by million 
the effect of the change in methodology was a decrease to depreciation and depletion expense of million in million 
the cumulative effect was a decrease to our net earnings of million  or cent per share  in  which is shown as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
for  the impact would have been a decrease in depreciation and depletion expense of million 

table of contents effective january   we will adopt for canadian gaap purposes the depreciation and depletion method described above for united states gaap purposes 
we are evaluating what impact this change will have on our consolidated financial statements and whether we are able to retroactively apply this change although applicable pronouncements indicate that it is to be applied prospectively 
had this method been applied beginning january   net earnings for and would have increased by million and million  respectively 
impairment we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows 
future cash flows are estimated based on estimated quantities of recoverable minerals  expected commodity prices considering current and historical prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  cash costs of production  capital and reclamation costs  all based on detailed life of mine plans 
the term recoverable minerals refers to the estimated amount of nickel or other commodities that will be obtained from proven and probable ore reserves and all related mineral interests  after taking into account losses during ore processing and treatment 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  which include inherent risks and uncertainties 
the assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period  the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups  taking into consideration movements of intermediate products to ensure the utilization of available capacity across our operations 
all assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows 
we periodically review our equity method investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the carrying amount is other than temporary 
in making this determination  we consider a number of factors related to the financial condition and prospects of the investee  including i a decline in the valuation of the equity investee for an extended period of time  ii an inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the equity investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment  and iii the period of time over which we intend to hold the investment 
if the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  the carrying value is written down to fair value 
in situations where the fair value of an investment is not evident due to a lack of a public market price or other factors  we use our best estimates and assumptions to arrive at the estimated fair value of such investment  based on future cash flows of the equity investee and other relevant factors 
as significant judgment is required in assessing these factors  it is possible that changes in any of these factors in the future could result in an other than temporary decline in value of an equity investment and could require us to record an impairment charge to operations in future periods 

table of contents there were no impairment losses on long lived assets recorded in in  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of  million as follows millions voisey s bay project victor deep project ontario write off of accounts and notes receivable write down of production assets other total the impairment loss with respect to the voisey s bay project was determined using the following assumptions a revenue assumptions for purposes of estimating future cash flows were based on the same commodity prices and exchange rates used to estimate proven and probable ore reserves at the end of as follows nickel per pound lme cash nickel price  copper per pound  cobalt per pound reduced from per pound used for ore reserves at the end of and a long term us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate of b the estimated production of nickel and copper concentrates were based on a concentrator operation capable of producing concentrate sufficient to refine on average million pounds of nickel per year 
initial processing of the nickel concentrate has been assumed to be done at the our ontario and manitoba operations for a period of years while hydrometallurgical processing facilities are developed and built in the province of newfoundland and labrador 
thereafter processing has been assumed to occur at these new hydrometallurgical facilities  c these production levels were based on initial production from the currently established estimated proven and probable ore reserves followed by production from underground sources where it has been assumed that estimated proven and probable ore reserves would be established by the start of underground mining currently anticipated to occur in  estimates of the quantity of ore and its grade that may be contained in such underground sources  the cost of mining such ore and the capital cost of mine development are subject to considerable uncertainty  and d the cost of operations were developed based on the definitive agreements entered into by us with the province of newfoundland and labrador that established the project scope  tax regime applicable to the project and the size and nature of the production facilities  among other things 
operating costs for mining and processing operations were developed based on our experience in mining and processing similar ores at our ontario and manitoba operations 
where production processes called for the use of new technology  cost estimates were developed by our technical personnel involved in the development of the process technologies 
estimated costs associated with the impacts and benefits agreements entered into between us and two aboriginal groups were also taken into consideration in developing the overall cost of operations 
the estimated proven and probable ore reserves for the voisey s bay project were based on a feasibility study prepared in and have been supported by additional exploration work and evaluations since that time 
subsequent to the impairment evaluation  we completed a bankable feasibility study for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project that includes construction of an open pit mine and concentrator  a port and related infrastructure development 
construction of the initial phase of our voisey s bay project is well underway as described above 
asset retirement obligations our mining operations involve activities that have a significant effect on the area surrounding such operations 
we estimated our ultimate reclamation and closure costs including those that we expect to incur during operations would total million 
effective january   we adopted cica  accounting for 
table of contents asset retirement obligations 
cica requires that we record the fair value of our estimated asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation is incurred 
these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income 
the accounting estimates related to reclamation and closure costs are critical accounting estimates because i we will not incur most of these costs for a number of years  requiring us to make estimates over a relatively long period  ii reclamation and closure laws and regulations could change in the future or circumstances affecting our operations could change  either of which could result in significant changes to our current plans and future costs  iii calculating the fair value of our asset retirement obligations requires management to assign probabilities to projected cash flows  to make long term assumptions about inflation rates  to determine our long term credit adjusted  risk free interest rates and to determine market risk premiums that are appropriate for our operations over long periods of time  and iv given the magnitude of our estimated reclamation and closure costs  changes in any or all of these estimates could have a material impact on our profitability and or our financial condition 
to calculate the fair value of these obligations  we discounted the projected cash flows at our estimated credit adjusted  risk free interest rates which ranged from two per cent to eight per cent for the corresponding time periods over which these costs would be incurred 
the inflation rates and discount rates we used to calculate the fair value of our asset retirement obligations are critical factors in the calculation of future value and discounted present value costs 
we estimated the cash flows for asset retirement obligations assuming the most likely set of outcomes 
in general  given the nature of our business and specificity of our assets  there are very restrictive ways in which to retire our assets and conform to the applicable environmental regulations including closure and related requirements 
therefore  in such instances  a range of likely outcomes was not used because multiple approaches to retire our assets were not appropriate 
we applied a market risk premium to the total obligations to reflect what a third party might demand to assume our asset retirement obligations 
the market risk premium was based on market based estimates of rates that a third party would have to pay to insure its exposure to possible future increases in the value of these obligations 
significant and difficult judgements by management are required in arriving at these estimates and  as noted above  changes in the estimates could have a material impact on our profitability 
in addition  there are certain environmental issues pertaining to former industrial sites that were retained by us relating to former businesses that had been sold by us 
in determining whether a liability exists in respect of these environmental issues  we apply the criteria for liability recognition set forth in applicable accounting standards 
we regularly review the status of environmental issues to determine whether a liability should be established or an additional liability recognized with the corresponding charge to our earnings 
future employee benefits and costs pension expense is determined separately for each of our pension plans and other post retirement arrangements based on the principles outlined in both canadian and united states accounting standards 
assets are valued using a market related value  determined based on the current market value and the market values in the previous four years that is  with an averaging of experience gains and losses over the five year period 
the expected return on assets assumption is based on current bond yields  an expected equity risk premium and an allowance for expected value added as a result of active management  where applicable 
for  the long term rate of return on assets assumption has been reduced from per cent to per cent 
this long term rate of return on assets assumption is reviewed on an annual basis 
liabilities are determined as a present value of future anticipated cash flows using a discount rate based on corporate aa bond yields at the valuation date and an inflation expectation consistent with the corporate aa bond yield curve 
differences between the estimated future results and actual future results are amortized to the extent that the cumulative experience gain or loss is in excess of the permitted per cent corridor under canadian gaap over the expected average remaining service life of the active members earsl 
this per cent corridor  as defined by canadian gaap  represents per cent of the greater of the post retirement benefits obligations and the fair value of plan assets 
the return on assets assumption and the discount rate  salary and inflation assumptions used to value the liabilities are reviewed annually and are determined based on a consistent 
table of contents framework from year to year 
the most significant risk is that the assumptions will prove to be either too high or too low in the long term 
it is reasonable to assume that there will be a significant variation between the assumptions which are set within the framework of a long term commitment and actual experience in any one year 
over the long term  cumulative pension expense is expected to produce an appropriate reflection of the costs associated with the pension program 
the expense for other post retirement benefits or non pension benefits is based on a similar methodology and similar determination of the liability value 
the discount rate used is the same as that determined for the pension obligations 
the inflation rate assumed for medical costs is based on our history of healthcare spending 
the assumption for the ultimate health care trend rates relates to the overall economic trends 
with this reasoning  the ultimate trend rate is comprised of the assumed inflation rate  real gross domestic product growth of per cent to per cent and health care expenditure growth rate at a slightly higher rate over the long term 
we currently estimate that a per cent increase or decrease in the return on assets assumption would result in a corresponding million decrease or increase  in annual pension expense 
changes to the return on assets assumption would have no significant effect on funding requirements  as our contributions are primarily determined based on the applicable canadian regulatory solvency funding requirements that is  the windup valuation 
under this valuation methodology  liabilities for solvency valuation are based on market bond yields and the excess of liabilities over assets must be amortized over a five year period 
we estimate that a per cent increase or decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a corresponding million decrease or increase in annual pension expense 
as we are currently contributing substantially more than the minimum requirements under certain applicable pension standards legislation and we currently plan to continue to do so over at least the next few years  long term bond yields would need to decline by more than one per cent from current levels to require any increase in contributions 
income and mining taxes the provision or relief for income and mining taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
the objectives of accounting for income and mining taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in determining both the current and future components of income and mining taxes  we interpret tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions as well as make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities 
if our interpretations differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as anticipated  the provision or relief for income and mining taxes could increase or decrease in future periods 
in estimating deferred income and mining tax assets  a valuation allowance is determined to reduce the future income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
this valuation allowance for amounted to million  comprising i million in respect of non capital losses available to goro nickel sa  ii million in respect of net capital losses available in the united states and united kingdom  and iii million in respect of unrealized capital losses arising from the write down of certain investments and other assets 
in  the valuation allowance was million  comprised of i million in respect of non capital losses for goro nickel sa  ii million in respect of net capital losses in the united states and united kingdom  iii million in respect of unrealized capital losses arising from the write down of certain investments and other assets  and iv million in respect of accrued unrealized foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated long term debt 
in  the valuation allowance amounted to million  representing i million in respect of net capital losses available in canada  the united states and united kingdom  and ii million in respect of capital losses for accrued unrealized foreign exchange losses on foreign currency denominated long term debt 
these valuation allowances have been provided for as it is more likely than not that these non capital and net capital losses will be realized for tax purposes in the future 
in each year  the amount of the valuation allowance reduces the future income tax assets and effectively increases the amount of the net deferred income tax liabilities and  accordingly  the provision for income and mining taxes on the earnings statement 
additional information regarding our accounting for income and mining taxes is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting changes effective january   we adopted  retroactively as a change in accounting policy  a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of earnings per share 
this new standard  which is consistent with united states gaap  changed the method in which diluted earnings per share are calculated 
the effect of this change is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
also effective january   we adopted  retroactively as a change in accounting policy  a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of stock based compensation and other stock based payments 
this new standard  which substantially conforms to united states gaap  requires either the recognition of a compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments to employees or  alternatively  the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share data as if stock based compensation had been recognized in earnings 
the effect of this change is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
also effective january   we adopted  retroactively  a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of interim financial statements 
as a consequence  we changed our accounting policy  for interim reporting purposes only  in connection with the timing of recognizing the costs associated with the planned annual shutdown of operations for maintenance 
previously  these costs were expensed evenly over the year whereas under the new standard such costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the effect of this change is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also adopted  for united states reporting purposes  certain united states standards relating to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  the effect of adopting these standards is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a new standard of the cica in respect of foreign currency translation  which conforms substantially to united states gaap  that eliminates the deferral and amortization of currency translation adjustments related to long term monetary items with a fixed and ascertainable life 
the effect of adopting this standard is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted new standards of the cica in respect of business combinations and goodwill for canadian reporting purposes 
these standards conform substantially to new united states standards  which we also adopted for united states reporting purposes commencing in the first quarter of also effective january   we adopted a new united states standard in respect of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for united states reporting purposes 
the adoption of these standards had no significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective july   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new standard that amended existing authoritative pronouncements relating to the accounting for the extinguishment of debt 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective december   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new interpretation that clarifies the requirements for disclosure of certain types of guarantees 
the interpretation also requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
effective december   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes  a new interpretation that addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities and provides guidance with respect to the disclosure of such entities 
there was no significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of the adoption of this interpretation 

table of contents effective january   we adopted  for united states reporting purposes commencing in the first quarter of  a new standard relating to the accounting for costs associated with the exit from or disposal of a business 
this standard requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred provided that such fair value can be reasonably estimated 
an exception applies for certain one time termination benefits that are incurred over time 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  effective january   for canadian and united states reporting purposes we adopted new standards in respect of accounting for asset retirement obligations 
these standards  which are substantially identical  require that a liability for retirement obligations be recognized when incurred and recorded at fair value 
the effect of adopting these standards is described in note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   for canadian and united states reporting purposes  we changed the accounting for stock based compensation from the intrinsic value method to one that recognizes in earnings the cost of stock based compensation based on the estimated fair value of new stock options granted to employees in and in future years 
the effect of this change in accounting policy is described in note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard of the cica in respect of the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which substantially conforms to united states gaap 
the adoption of the new standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we will be adopting new accounting guidelines issued by the cica in respect of hedging relationships for canadian reporting purposes 
the new guidelines will be applied commencing with hedging relationships outstanding on january  we do not anticipate that the new guidelines will have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   we will adopt cica  generally accepted accounting principles 
cica describes what constitutes canadian gaap and its sources 
we are currently evaluating how this standard will be implemented and what impact the adoption of this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook we continue to pursue our goal of being the world s most profitable nickel producer through our three part strategy of maintaining strong low cost operations focused on high margin production  pursuing profitable growth and enhancing our strong global marketing position  including the development and sale of value added products 
our two major development projects  goro and voisey s bay  are currently expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
operations at our manitoba operations  we expect to continue to see lower ore grades in however  we expect marginally higher production in manitoba in due to increased production from this operations birchtree mine and certain concentrator modifications  which will partially offset the lower grades  and despite a planned rebuild of one of this operation s two furnaces which will result in a single furnace operation for approximately seven weeks during the year 
at our ontario operations  we plan to extend intervals between maintenance shutdowns to months from months and as a result our planned production for is scheduled to increase 
this change is expected to raise production in we also plan to increase purchased intermediates processed at ontario in and 
table of contents shutdown sections of the processing facilities for shorter maintenance intervals rather than stopping production for the normal one month maintenance shutdown 
in addition  our current plan for is to run this operations smelter at  tons per day of furnace feed  above its design capacity 
we produce virtually all of our own platinum group metals from ontario ores and currently expect production of  troy ounces in we are currently developing one orebody  the orebody at coleman and the creighton deep area  to meet our future platinum group metals production targets as we plan to maintain platinum group metals production at the  troy ounces level beyond at pt inco  we plan to enhance mining methods in to minimize dilution while optimizing ore grades and blending to mitigate ore chemistry related delays in the process plant 
in order to keep pace with rising production volumes  we are increasing drilling and mine development at pt inco 
this will include mining material from our new mining area of petea where ore chemistry is amenable to blending with our other sorowako area ores as high quality feed for pt inco s process plant 
initial production from petea is expected to begin at the end of at pt inco  the lack of sufficient low cost power to maximize production remains a bottleneck in its operations 
energy accounted for about per cent of pt inco s total production costs in we plan to increase production by using more costly fuel fired generators 
we also plan to increase wet ore stockpiling  allowing ore to dry out and drain better since every one per cent reduction in water content saves about seven per cent of the fuel used for pt inco s dryers or approximately million in costs per year 
in addition  we are working to combine pt inco s thermal and hydroelectric systems by late to generate about megawatts of power more than each system can produce alone 
we are currently evaluating whether to build a third dam for pt inco to raise its hydroelectric capacity by approximately megawatts to approximately megawatts 
such an additional dam could enable pt inco to produce up to million pounds of nickel in matte annually and lower its costs of production by up to about to per pound 
in ontario  we are taking various measures to control costs  including manpower reductions 
we reduced our sudbury workforce by some people in and currently expect to reduce this workforce by more than people in in addition  we are targeting lower use and cost of supplies and services through global procurement practices like electronic auctions and volume leverage 
our corporate wide objective is to cut controllable costs across our operations by to per cent over the next to months by developing and putting in place new productivity programs and taking other actions to improve the competitiveness of our operations 
we are currently targeting million in cost reductions in planned capital expenditures and production our capital expenditures are currently expected to total  million  including  as discussed above  approximately million for the initial phase of the voisey s bay project  approximately million for the goro project assuming a decision to proceed on this project is made in the summer of and approximately million in sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations  of which about million will be required for environmental measures and about million for existing operations to maximize nickel production  primarily at pt inco 
our nickel production is currently expected to be in the range of  to  tonnes  up substantially from the  tonne level in our nickel production was negatively impacted by the strike at our ontario operations 
we expect our purchases of nickel intermediates to increase by over per cent from levels to approximately  tonnes in this external feed source is expected to represent the source of per cent of planned finished nickel production  up from  tonnes in as discussed above 
we use purchased intermediates to increase the processing capacity utilization of our ontario and manitoba operations  as discussed under risks and uncertainties other risks and uncertainties above  and to maintain nickel production at the manitoba operations at or near its  tonne annual capacity 
while such use is profitable  it does increase our costs  particularly at higher nickel prices since the cost of purchased intermediates is based on prevailing lme prices 
copper production is currently expected to be approximately  tonnes in  up per cent from  tonnes in total production of platinum group metals is expected to increase to  troy ounces in from the strike affected level of  troy ounces 

table of contents nickel market conditions stainless steel demand has grown by almost six per cent annually for more than years  including the past decade  and we have seen no signs that such growth will be slowing down during at least the next few years 
the stainless steel industry  the principal end use market for nickel  has been making significant investments to increase production capacity in an attempt to meet continued demand growth 
demand for stainless steel is currently expected to remain strong over at least the next few years based upon the expected resumption of strong growth in world demand  in particular continued strong demand growth in china 
the combination of china s stainless steel demand growth and nickel demand growth in accounted for more than two thirds of the overall increase in world nickel demand for with most nickel producers operating at or near capacity in and taking into account that there currently exists limited shutdown capacity available to be restarted and with the latest round of expansions to existing production capacity coming to an end  we currently estimate that there will be an insufficient amount of additional nickel supply prior to to meet the expected growth in demand 
nickel demand in is currently anticipated to be relatively strong for several reasons 
first  more than three million tonnes of stainless steel capacity was commissioned in and  with about million tonnes of additional production from this new capacity in these large expansions  in addition to several new projects  are expected to result in higher production of stainless steel in second  chinese nickel demand has continued to grow during the last three years  even when western world economic growth was essentially flat or declining 
for  the projected demand strength in china is expected to be complemented by the emerging economic recovery in the united states and other western world regions 
third  reported nickel inventories  both producer and lme  are at very low levels relative to prior nickel cycles 
these inventory levels at december  represented approximately weeks of demand  which is considered very low 
fourth  the availability of nickel containing stainless steel scrap  as an alternative source of nickel for the stainless steel industry  is not expected to keep pace with demand growth in  due to low levels of such scrap from russia  continued growth in consumption of such scrap by chinese mini mills  and the projected increase in stainless steel production 
non gaap financial measure we have referred to nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits because we understand that certain investors use this information to assess our performance and also determine our ability to generate cash flow for use in investing activities 
the inclusion of these two unit cost measurements  nickel unit cash cost of sales before and after by product credits  enables investors to better understand our year to year changes in production costs using metrics that reflect our key ongoing cash production costs which  in turn  affect our profitability and cash flows 
these measurements capture all of the important components of our production and related costs 
the reason for providing the nickel unit cash cost of sales on the basis of before as well as after by product credits is to allow investors to see the impact on these metrics of changes in copper  cobalt and precious metals contributions which have historically largely been driven by the prices for these metals 
in addition  as discussed above  management utilizes these metrics as an important management tool to monitor cost performance of each of our key operations relative to planned and prior period results 
these measurements are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with canadian gaap
