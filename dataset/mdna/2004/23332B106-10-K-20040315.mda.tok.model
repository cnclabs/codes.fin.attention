item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the financial section of this annual report consists of the following management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  and the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes 
the following section is designed to provide you with a narrative of our financial results and evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
due to various applicable reporting and disclosure rules  a reader may be somewhat overwhelmed by the length and detail required for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  we have included an overview section that is designed to provide you with some perspective about the information contained in this section  as well as a better understanding of the key drivers and concerns of our business 
the purpose of this overview section is to inform the reader about how we generate revenues and what are some of our significant expenses  as well as discuss the status of our business in the context of industry wide trends and explain our management s view of the implication and significance of these trends 
overview our business model is relatively straightforward 
dsp group is a fabless semiconductor company that is a leader in providing chipsets to telephone equipment manufacturers that incorporate our chipsets into consumer products for the residential wireless telecommunication market 
our chipsets incorporate advanced technologies  such as dsp processors  communications technologies  highly advanced radio frequency rf devices and in house developed voice over internet protocol voip hardware and software technologies 
our products include mhz  ghz  dect ghz and ghz chipsets for cordless telephones  bluetooth for voice  data and video communication  and solutions for digital voice recorders dvrs  mp and voip applications and other voice over packet applications 
our current primary focus is cordless telephony as our ghz and ghz products represented over of our total revenues in in november  we transferred our dsp cores licensing business to our then wholly owned subsidiary  ceva  inc  which thereafter combined with parthus technologies plc to form ceva  inc fka parthusceva  fka since the spin off  we are more focused on product sales  and we operate in one business segment 
to eliminate any confusion  our then wholly owned subsidiary  ceva  inc  will be addressed as ceva and ceva  inc 
fka parthusceva  inc will be addressed as parthusceva in the relevant discussions about these entities in this section 
during recent years we have become a worldwide leader in developing and marketing total telephony solutions for a wide range of applications for wireless residential markets 
the key factor that enabled us to grow our business  improve our profitability and increase our market share over the previous years is our ability to combine and integrate our expertise in dsp cores technology with proprietary advanced rf devices  communications technologies and speech processing algorithms 
we believe we were able to penetrate the residential wireless telephony market and increase our market share and customer base by taking advantage of three trends in the market the move from wired to wireless products  the transformation from analog based to digital based technologies for telephony products  and the market acceptance of the change of bandwidth for telephony products from mhz to ghz technologies  as well as the recent move from ghz to ghz technologies 
our focus on the convergence of these three trends has allowed us to offer products with more features  and better range  security and voice quality 

table of contents we believe that due to our continued focus on dynamic and changing market needs and trends  we remain positioned to take advantage of trends in the market  including the convergence and integration of features and technologies into one chipset 
we are responding to this trend by developing and selling a portfolio of system on a chip  short range communication edct  dect  bluetooth  solutions for portable multimedia speech  music  video and still image  and voip applications in consumer electronics and telecommunication products 
our planned future lines of products are intended to integrate video  voice  data and communications technologies  and help us strengthen our position as a leading supplier of multimedia communications products 
products that we are developing in include the dect ghz chipset for the european market  a new chipset that includes video technologies capabilities and a new bluetooth chipset 
on a historical basis  from to  our business produced million of revenues  representing a compounded annual growth rate cagr of 
we also achieved an increase of million in our cash position  after the distribution of million in cash and other related payments to ceva in november more specifically  in  our revenues grew by in comparison to the same period in  reaching a record level of million 
during  we were able to offset the continued decline in average selling prices of our integrated circuits for cordless telephony products by decreasing our manufacturing costs  due to technological improvements  continuing improvements in our yield percentages  especially in our rf products  decrease in costs of wafers and assembly as well as the integration of more semiconductor content in a single system 
as a result  our gross profit increased to a record level of in from in our operating profit increased by in as compared to and reached a level of million  approximately of revenues compared with in during the same period  our operating expenses increased by and reached a level of million  including the write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of teleman multimedia inc in may  which amounted to approximately million 
this increase in operating expenses was mainly a result of our significant increase in research and development expenses  primary attributed to the hiring of new employees and initiation of new research and development projects in the increase in our revenues in was primarily a result of strong demand from both existing and new original equipment manufacturer oem customers  especially in japan and asia pacific  for our ghz and ghz single and multi hand set chipsets 
our revenues in japan and asia pacific increased by and  respectively  in  in comparison to the same period in our ability to offer more integrated features and functions on our chipsets  together with the growth of the wireless residential market  contributed to our significant growth 
during the second quarter of  we moved into the multimedia communications market by acquiring the assets of teleman for a total consideration of million plus transaction expenses 
in addition  we hired engineers that were previously employed by teleman 
teleman  founded in  has developed an advanced silicon platform for video compression and decompression designed to interface with image sensors and panel displays 
the teleman silicon platform supports compression standards such as mpeg  jpeg and h our first line of video products  which is anticipated to be introduced in the fourth quarter of  will enable the compression and decompression of video signals and may be incorporated into a variety of applications 
in we also achieved new design wins with existing oem customers as well as with new oem customers  including the two first design wins for our new dect products targeted for the european market 
we expect to begin shipping these dect products in the second half of 
table of contents we believe that we are now prepared to meet the exciting challenges of the dynamic and evolving markets for short range multimedia communication and home wireless networking by combining our ability to integrate voice  data and video technologies 
we currently expect an increased demand for our existing product lines in and anticipate that the dect and multimedia markets  including video and bluetooth  will drive our growth in and increase our market share in europe 
although we experienced growth historically and were able to increase both revenues and gross margin in  there are several market trends that challenge our ability to continue to grow our business 
our business operates in highly innovative environments  typical mass consumer market  characterized by changing standards and rapid introduction of new products offering improved performance at lower prices 
as part of our overall strategy  we have used our core competencies  global presence and financial strength to keep pace with competition 
however  we believe new developments in the home residential market may adversely affect our operating results 
for example  the rapid deployment of new communication access methods  including mobile  broadband  cable and voip connections  as well as the projected lack of growth in products using fixed line telephony  meaning communication through phones connected to telephone lines  would reduce our revenues derived from  and unit sales of  cordless telephony products  which is currently our primary focus 
our ability to maintain our growth will depend on the expansion of our product lines to capitalize on the emerging communication access methods and on our success in developing and selling a portfolio of system on a chip solutions that integrate video  voice  data and communication technologies in a wider multimedia market 
we are also very dependent on the ability of our oem customers to penetrate the consumer markets with their end products that integrate our technologies 
moreover  the continued growth of our business depends on our ability to deliver state of the art technologies in a cost effective and timely manner 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased the average selling prices of our products 
as a result  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices than we currently anticipate  which may result in lower profits 
we must continue to monitor and control costs  improve operating yields and maintain our current level of gross margin in order to offset future declines in average selling prices 
in addition  in order to increase our sales volume we will need to penetrate the european market with our new line of dect products  which is anticipated to be introduced in the third quarter of for these reasons  we cannot assure you that our business will grow at the previous pace  if at all 
you should not rely upon our past operating results as an indication of future performance 
during  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share 
our total position in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased during by million to a total of million as of december  critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
these accounting principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any given reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including 
table of contents those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns  inventories  investments  intangible assets  taxes on income  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements inventory valuation 
our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
certain events could occur that would materially affect our management s estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
for example  changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby impacting our income tax provision 
carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  and  as a result  significant declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
if our management s estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets that will result in additional income tax expense recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
business combinations  valuation of goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expenses 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires our management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
commencing january   we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of an asset with its carrying value 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires our management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows 
table of contents and other factors to determine the fair value of a respective asset 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
intangible assets 
as a result of our purchase of teleman  we have acquired intangible assets 
the determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates have been based on our business plans for the entity acquired 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
for all other customers  we recognize general reserves for bad debts 
if circumstances change  including higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
issues relating to collectibility have historically been insignificant 
contingencies 
we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  which may result in higher net loss 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the above critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
results of operations during  we increased our revenues and net income generated by our fabless semiconductor business 
we demonstrated year over year growth of in revenues 
our gross profit and operating income increased significantly by and  respectively  as compared to due to an increase in revenues and gross profit we significantly increased our operating income as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  despite a increase in operating expenses 
total revenues 
our total revenues were million in  million in and million in this represents an increase in revenues of in as compared to  and an increase of in revenues in as compared to this increase of in was primarily as a result of strong demand  especially from our oems in japan and asia pacific  for our ghz and ghz single handset products  as well as ghz multi handset products 
the revenue increase was also a result of a significant increase of sales in asia pacific of ghz products that incorporated our chipsets by our new oem customers with well established consumer electronics brands 
our revenues for increased primarily as a result of strong demand for our new ghz 
table of contents single hand set and ghz multi hand set products 
sales of ghz products represented approximately of our total revenues for during both comparable periods we were able to partially off set the decline in average selling price of our products by adding advanced and pioneer features to our products 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our truespeech algorithms 
however  license fees and per unit royalties from truespeech licensees have not been significant to date  and we do not expect them to increase significantly in the future 
as our products are generally incorporated into consumer products sold by our oem customers  our revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer products sold by our oem customers that incorporate our products 
the fourth quarter in any given year is usually the strongest quarter of sales for our oem customers and  as a result  the third quarter in any given year is usually the strongest quarter for our revenues as our oem customers request increased shipments of our products in anticipation of the fourth quarter holiday season 
this trend can be observed from reviewing our quarterly information and results of operations 
export sales  consisting of integrated digital telephony idt speech processors shipped to manufacturers in europe and asia  including japan and asia pacific  represented of our total revenues in  and all export sales are denominated in us dollars 
the following table shows the breakdown of net revenues for the periods indicated by geographic location in thousands year ended december  united states japan europe asia excluding japan total revenues significant customers 
revenues derived from sales through one distributor  tomen electronics  accounted for of our total revenues in as compared to in and in the decrease in as compared to was due to increased volumes of sales in asia pacific that offset the increase in absolute sales figure in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to a greater volume of sales in japan 
the japanese market and the oems that operate in that market are among the largest suppliers with significant market share in the us market for residential wireless products 
tomen electronics sells our products to a limited number of customers 
one customer  panasonic communications co  ltd  has continually accounted for a majority of the sales through tomen electronics 
the loss of tomen electronics as a distributor and our inability to obtain a satisfactory replacement in a timely manner would harm our sales and results of operations 
additionally  the loss of panasonic and tomen electronics inability to thereafter effectively market our products would also harm our sales and results of operations 
revenues from our ghz products represented of our total revenues for the year ended december  we believe that sales of this product line will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our revenues in however  as previously discussed  we believe the rapid 
table of contents deployment of new communication access methods  as well as the projected lack of growth in fixed line telephony  would reduce our total revenues derived from  and unit sales of  cordless telephony products  including future sales of our ghz products 
we believe in order to maintain our growth  we will need to expand our product lines and develop a portfolio of system on a chip solutions that integrate video  voice  data and communication technologies in a wider multimedia market 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in and in each of and the significant increase in our gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to our ability to offset the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products with a greater reduction in manufacturing costs  as a result of technological improvements  continuing improvements in our yield percentages  especially in our rf products  as well as the integration of more semiconductor content in a single system 
furthermore  the reduction in manufacturing costs was partially a result of extensive cost reduction in the testing portion of our manufacturing process that was implemented by our testing team  as well as a result of reduction of our raw materials costs 
however  we cannot guarantee that our ongoing efforts in cost reduction will be successful or that they will keep pace with the anticipated continued decline in average selling prices of our processors 
our gross margin may decrease in the future due to a variety of factors  including the continued decline in the average selling prices of our products  our failure to achieve the corresponding cost reductions  roll out of new products in any given period and our failure to introduce new engineering processes 
our gross margin reflects the sale of chips and chipsets that have different margins 
thus  changes in the mix of products sold also will impact our gross margin 
moreover  penetration of new competitive mature markets  such as the european dect market  could require us to reduce sale prices and harm our gross margin 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the increase in was primarily attributed to increased salary expenses  mainly due to a greater number of research and development employees  increased allocated facilities expenses  increased depreciation and maintenance expenses of our development software tools and increased project material expenses 
as of december   we had research and development employees  as compared to as of december  the increase was also attributed to expenses incurred by our korean subsidiary  established in connection with the teleman acquisition  which began its operations during the second quarter of research and development expenses for also included expenses in the amount of million related to the amortization of workforce and patents acquired from teleman in may and an expense of approximately million related to accelerated depreciation of software tools mainly the cad design tools 
as our research and development team is working on various projects simultaneously and continuing to grow  we anticipate our research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in as compared to the decrease in as compared with was primarily attributed to the decrease in expenses related to voip projects  as well as the devaluation of the new israeli shekel nis compared to the us dollar 
a significant portion of our research and development team is located and employed in our israeli development center 
as a result  we experienced a decrease in engineers payroll expenses denominated in nis of our research and development employees employed by our israeli subsidiary  partially offset by greater use of subcontractors and semiconductor mask work expenses incurred in connection with the introduction of new products 

table of contents research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the decrease in percentage in as compared to resulted mainly from higher level of revenues in research and development expenses consist mainly of payroll expenses to employees involved in research and development activities  expenses related to tape out and mask work  subcontracting and engineering expenses  depreciation and maintenance fees related to equipment and software tools used in research and development and facilities expenses associated with research and development 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily attributed to higher levels of salary expenses  mainly due to a greater number of application support employees  increased facilities expenses associated with sales and marketing  and expenses incurred by our european subsidiary located in scotland  which began its operations in the beginning of sales commissions paid to our representatives and distributors were approximately the same in absolute dollars for both and because the increase in commissions  due to increased revenues in  was offset by lower average commission rates 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributed to higher levels of commissions due to higher revenues 
the higher sales commissions in as compared to were partially offset by lower payroll expenses denominated in nis for our sales and marketing employees employed by our israeli subsidiary due to a decrease in the value of nis in comparison to the united states dollar 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the decrease in percentage in as compared to and the decrease in as compared to were both due to an increase in total revenues for both periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of sales commissions to our representatives and distributors  payroll expenses to direct sales and marketing employees  trade show expenses and facilities expenses associated with sales and marketing 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and increased slightly to million in from million in the increase in was attributed mainly to the fact that for all periods prior to november we allocated a portion of our payroll  accounting  legal and other costs included in our general and administrative expenses to the dsp cores licensing business  and these expenses were included under discontinued operations in our financial statements in and the increase in general and administrative expenses in was mainly due to higher bonus payments to our employees  which were partially offset by lower expenses 
the lower expenses in were due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisition of voicepump  in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which statement we adopted in january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in general and administrative expenses consist mainly of payroll for management and administrative employees  expenses related to investor relations  accounting and legal costs  as well as facilities expenses associated with general and administrative activities 

table of contents in process research and development write off 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a non recurring expense item in the amount of approximately million related to the write off of in process research and development associated with the teleman acquisition 
this amount represented research and development expenses related to technologies that did not reach technological feasibility and for which there was no future alternative use  as determined on the acquisition date 
aborted spin off and other expenses 
during the first quarter of  we recorded two unusual expense items in the amount of approximately million 
an expense of approximately million was recorded related to the planning for an initial public offering of our dsp cores licensing business  which did not occur 
those expenses were comprised mainly of legal and accounting services rendered in additionally  an expense of approximately million was recorded to reflect the write off of all of our investment in messagebay  a private company that develops software 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net  was million in  million in and in the decrease in interest and other income  net of interest expense  in as compared to and in as compared to  was a result of overall lower market interest rates in both periods 
the decrease in as compared to was also attributed to our lower levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the beginning of due to the distribution of million in cash to ceva as part of the separation and distribution of assets in connection with the transfer of our dsp cores licensing business to ceva in november interest and other income for the year ended included capital gain in the amount of million 
in may  we sold the remaining  shares of the common stock of tower semiconductor ltd 
for an aggregate of million 
as a result  we recorded a capital gain in the amount of we no longer have any equity interest in tower semiconductor 
impairment of available for sale marketable securities 
during the second quarter of  our management s evaluation indicated that the decline in value of our ordinary shares of audiocodes ltd 
was other than temporary 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 we realized a loss on our investment in audiocodes in the amount of million  which was recorded as impairment of available for sale marketable securities in our unaudited consolidated statements of income for the six months ended june  and included as such in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  impairment of available for sale marketable securities in also included the decline in value of our investment in equity securities of tower semiconductors ltd 
and tomen corporation  which were assessed to be other than temporary  and amounted to  and  respectively both recorded in the fourth quarter of 
provision for income taxes 
our tax provision for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we recorded a tax benefit which decreased our tax liability related to our investment in audiocodes in the amount of million due to the impairment of such investment 
thus  the provision for income taxes presented in the financial statements amounted to  in  and  we benefited for federal tax purposes from foreign tax holiday and tax exempt income in israel 
dsp group ltd  our israeli subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status by the israeli government with respect to six separate investment plans 
approved enterprise status allows for a tax holiday for a period of two to four years and a reduced corporate tax rate of for an additional six or eight years  on each investment plan s proportionate share of taxable income 
the tax benefits under these investment plans are scheduled to expire starting through to 
table of contents discontinued operations 
on april   we entered into a combination agreement with ceva and parthus technologies plc pursuant to which we agreed to affect a combination of ceva with parthus 
on november   we contributed our dsp cores licensing business and the operations and related assets and liabilities of such business to ceva and distributed all of the ceva common stock we held to our stockholders 
immediately afterwards  parthus was acquired by ceva in exchange for the issuance of additional shares of ceva common stock and a new company  parthusceva  was formed 
in anticipation of the consummation of these transactions  as of june   we began to report the statements of income of our dsp cores licensing business as discontinued operations 
our financial statements for the years ended december  and were presented to reflect the operations of ceva as discontinued operations 
our financial statements for previous years included the dsp cores licensing business that was transferred to parthusceva 
the assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows of the dsp cores licensing business were carved out from our financial statements and were presented as discontinued operations 
the consolidated financial statements have been carved out using the historical basis of the assets and liabilities and historical results of operations related to the dsp cores licensing business 
additionally  the discontinued operations for previous years included allocations of certain of our corporate headquarters assets  liabilities and expenses relating to the dsp cores licensing business 
the net income from discontinued operations included the costs directly attributed to the dsp cores licensing business  including charges for shared facilities  functions and services used by the dsp cores licensing business 
such costs included research and development costs  and sales and general and administrative expenses 
such allocations and charges were based on either a direct cost pass through or a percentage of total costs for the services provided based on factors such as headcount or the specific level of activity directly related to such costs 
our statements of income for included the results of operations of ceva from the beginning of the year until the date of the spin off of the dsp cores licensing business  which was november  net income derived from our dsp cores licensing business was million for the months ended october   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in total revenues for the dsp cores licensing business 
our total revenues for the dsp cores licensing business were million for the months period of  as compared to million for the year the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to i lower licensing revenues for the dsp cores licensing business  ii lower per unit royalties from some of the license agreements for the dsp cores licensing business primarily due to volume pricing  and iii lower technical support and other revenues primarily attributed to the provision of fewer technical support and related services for the dsp cores licensing business  primarily as a result of the slowdown in the global wireless and cellular markets 
our results of operations for the year ended december  included an amount of  related to the disposal of assets and liabilities  net  of our dsp cores licensing business after the separation 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
we generated and million of cash and cash equivalents from our operating activities during and  respectively  as compared to million during our net income in  excluding the non cash effect of in process research and development write off and capital gain in was million 
our net income in  excluding the impairment of securities and one time expense items was million 
the calculation of net income for both periods excluded the related tax effect 
the increase in net income in as compared to was off set by the increase of million in accounts receivables partly off set by an increase in accrued compensation and benefits 
our accounts receivables increased to million as of december   representing days of sales outstanding  which was in line with our customers payment terms 
the increase in cash provided by our operations during as compared to was primarily due to higher volume of revenues and an increase in gross margin which resulted in a significant increase in our gross profit which was slightly offset by an increase in our operating expenses 
the combination of these factors resulted in an increase in operating income in in addition  the increase in cash from operating activities resulted from an increase in income taxes payable as well as from an increase in accrued expenses and other accounts payable 
this increase in was partially offset by an increase in inventory as well as a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits in in comparison to our inventory increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in inventory was primarily attributed to our higher levels of sales and production during  as well as from changing our manufacturing procedures from a turn key solution to work in progress utilizing subcontractors to test  assemble and pack the integrated circuits 
investing activities 
we invest excess cash in marketable securities of varying maturity  depending on our projected cash needs for operations  capital expenditures and other business purposes 
in  we purchased million of investments classified as held to maturity marketable securities  as compared to million in and million in in addition  million of our investments in marketable securities matured in as compared to million in and million in as of december   the amortized cost of our held to maturity marketable securities was and their stated market value was million  representing an unrealized gain of million 
our capital equipment purchases amounted to million in  million in and million in and were mainly for computer hardware  software and software tools used in engineering development  engineering test and lab equipment  leasehold improvements  vehicles  and furniture and fixtures 
in addition  we are committed to pay an additional million during for software tools we have purchased during as part of our acquisition of teleman s assets in may for an aggregate consideration of million in cash  including transaction costs of approximately million  we paid an aggregate of million during the year we are obligated to make two additional payments of million each on may  and may  
table of contents in addition  in january  we purchased  ordinary shares of an independent wafer manufacturer company  tower semiconductor ltd 
for million 
in and in  we sold  and  of tower semiconductor s ordinary shares for approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in a capital gain of million 
during we collected approximately million from customers of the dsp cores licensing business  a business that was transferred to ceva in november this amount was included under cash received from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  included cash distributed to discontinued operations in the amount of approximately million 
this amount represented the net cash transferred to the dsp cores licensing business during that period 
our available for sale marketable securities amounted to million as of december  during january  we sold  shares of audiocodes ltd 
ordinary shares for an aggregate amount of million  resulting in a capital gain of approximately million and cash flows of approximately million 
financing activities 
during  we received million upon the exercise of employee stock options and through purchases pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  as compared to million during and million during we can not predict cash flows from options exercises in future periods 
as part of our spin off of the dsp cores licensing business  in  we transferred to ceva million in cash and paid million in cash to the israeli tax authorities  these amounts were recorded as a dividend in our statements of cash flows as part of our financing activities 
in march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
in july  our board authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares of our common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
during the year  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for an aggregated purchase price of million 
we did not make any repurchases in pursuant to our share repurchase program  approximately  million shares of our common stock remain authorized for repurchase 
at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million  and marketable securities of approximately million 
our working capital at december  was approximately million  and our backlog as of december  was million 
as we generate most of our cash flows from our operating activities  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  cash deposits and marketable securities and our forecasted positive cash flows for future periods  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for both the short and long term 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new 
table of contents markets 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all

interest rate risk 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments  except for hedging of foreign currency exposures discussed below 
we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure since we do not have any financial obligation and our financial assets are measured on a held to maturity basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as a significant part of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and do not expect to incur significant gains and losses in however  due to the volatility in the exchange rate of the nis versus the us dollar  we decided to hedge part of the risk of a devaluation of the nis  which could have an adverse effect on the expenses that we incur in the state of israel 
for example  to protect against an increase in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from salary payments denominated in nis during  we instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
these option contracts are designated as cash flow hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and are all effective as hedges of these expenses 
for more information about our hedging activity  see note to the attached notes to consolidated financial statement for the year ended december
