item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of alabama national as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
the accounting and reporting policies of alabama national conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general financial service industry practices 
the historical consolidated financial statements of alabama national and the five year summary of selected financial data derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of alabama national are set forth elsewhere herein 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data and the other financial information included in this annual report 
executive overview the purpose of this section is to provide a brief overview of additional detail about the income statement and balance sheet is provided in the pages following this summary 

table of contents income statement alabama national reported a increase in net income for over levels  with diluted earnings per share growing from to 
the increase in net income is higher than the increase in diluted earnings per share because alabama national issued additional shares of stock during to acquire millennium bank and through the exercise of stock options by option holders 
the two components of revenue for alabama national net interest income and noninterest income both grew in over levels  with the growth in noninterest income being much greater 
noninterest income includes mortgage banking  securities brokerage and trust services  investment services  insurance services  and service charges and other fees associated with traditional retail and commercial banking 
noninterest income grew million  or during the areas of largest growth included mortgage banking up million  investment services up million  and securities brokerage and trust revenue up million 
mortgage banking and investment services revenue both benefited in from the decline in interest rates 
the rate decline led to strong demand by mortgage customers  including refinances of existing mortgages and mortgages originated to finance home purchases 
in the investment services division  the rate decline led to rapid repayment and calls of many securities owned by alabama national s customers  leading to demand from those customers for the purchase of new securities to replace the ones that were repaid or called 
net interest income grew million  or  in despite a reduction in the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
the federal reserve s actions to reduce interest rates resulted in a decline in earning asset yields that exceeded the decline in liability costs 
as a result  the spread between the rate earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and the rate paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities compressed during the year 
alabama national was able to grow net interest income during in spite of this reduced spread due to its growth in earning assets and liabilities 
on the expense side  alabama national s noninterest expenses grew million  or 
some of this growth in noninterest expenses was associated with the expansion of the number of branch offices and associated personnel and other operating expenses associated with that expansion  including the millennium acquisition 
a portion of the expense growth was also due to increased commission based compensation expenses caused by increased revenue in the investment services division  the mortgage banking division  and the securities brokerage and trust division 
balance sheet alabama national s balance sheet expanded during  with total assets growing million or over december  levels 
the largest categories of asset growth occurred in loans and leases up million and securities up million 
deposits grew million during the year 
in june   alabama national completed the acquisition of millennium bank of gainesville  florida 
this acquisition increased total assets  loans  and deposits by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
asset quality alabama national reported net charge offs of million  or of average loans and leases  down from s million of average loans and leases 
nonperforming assets at december  were million of period end loans and leases and foreclosed property  down from year end s million of period end loans and leases and foreclosed property 
potential problem loans fell to million at december  from year end s million 
as a result of these factors and management s assessment of the inherent risk in the loan and lease portfolio  alabama national s provision for loan and lease losses declined from million in to million in 
table of contents selected bank financial data alabama national s success is dependent upon the financial performance of its subsidiary banks the banks

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates alabama national s accounting policies are critical to understanding the results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies utilized by alabama national are discussed in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning on page f herein 
some of the more complex technical accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the valuation of reported assets and liabilities  including associated revenues  expenses  and disclosure 
the following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations 
allowance for loan and lease losses alabama national records estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios as an allowance for loan and lease losses 
the methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan and lease losses involve significant judgments to be made by management 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses include judgments about credit worthiness of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  and the impact of current events  conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses ultimately confirmed by alabama national may be different than management s estimates provided in the consolidated financial statements 
for a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses  see note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
mergers and acquisitions alabama national s growth in business and profitability over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions 
prior to july  certain of alabama national s acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests business combination method of accounting 
effective july   alabama national adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which allows only the use of the purchase method of accounting 
for purchase acquisitions  alabama national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
income taxes the calculation of alabama national s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of alabama national s overall business strategy  management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration 
this analysis includes evaluating the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on alabama national s overall tax position 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits alabama national is the sponsor of two defined benefit pension plans that have been frozen with regard to future benefit accruals and also offers postretirement benefit plans to employees 
the calculation of obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
actuarial valuations and the determination of future market values of plan assets are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s benefit plans 
stock based compensation alabama national uses a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation costs 
compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized over the related service period 
accounting for stock based compensation requires the use of an option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and the expected dividends on it  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s stock based compensation awards 
other there are other complex accounting standards that require alabama national to employ significant judgment in interpreting and applying certain of the principles proscribed by those standards 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  determination of whether a financial instrument or other contract meets the definition of a derivative in accordance with sfas no 
 the accounting for a transfer of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 and the determination of asset impairment  including when such impairment is other than temporary

results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  net income per diluted share increased to for the year ended december   as compared to recorded for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income increased slightly by million and interest expense decreased million 
the increase in net interest income is attributable to a decrease in the interest rate paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities and a million increase in average loans to billion during  from billion in during  alabama national was able to continue to decrease the rates paid on deposits as time deposits originated in higher interest rate environments matured and repriced at the current lower rates 
alabama national was able to absorb the effects of falling rates on its earning assets by continued robust growth in its earning assets  particularly loans 
the increase in average loans is a result of continued strength in many of the economies in the markets served by alabama national 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset and management continues to emphasize steady loan growth 
during  alabama national also experienced substantial growth in its securities portfolio 
average securities totaled million in  compared to in average interest bearing liabilities increased million  to billion in despite the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  interest expense decreased million during 
table of contents all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during the largest increase was in average time deposits 
during  the average balance of time deposits increased million  to billion in  compared to billion in interest bearing transaction accounts also increased by million during alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the net interest margin for was negatively impacted by federal reserve bank rate reductions of basis points in the fourth quarter of and also by the additional basis point reduction during the second quarter of alabama national was able to immediately pass along much of the rate reductions to interest bearing transaction accounts  but time deposits can only reprice to current rates at maturity 
in addition  the spread above noninterest bearing deposits declines with any rate reduction because the cost of this liability category does not change but the yield on earning assets reduces with such a rate reduction

alabama national recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of million during  compared to million in management believes that both loan loss experience and asset quality indicate that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an adequate level  although there can be no assurance that economic or regulatory factors will not require further increases in the allowance 
alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of period end loans and leases excluding loans held for sale was at december   compared with at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  alabama national experienced net charge offs of million in  equating to a ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases of  compared with net charge offs of million in  equating to a ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases of

noninterest income  including net securities gains and losses  increased million  or  to a record million in  compared with million in the revenue recorded by the investment services division  securities brokerage and trust division and mortgage division were all record amounts for alabama national 
total revenue for the investment services division increased million  or  to million in  from million in total revenue earned from the mortgage division increased million  or  to million in  from million in the securities brokerage and trust division experienced a revenue increase of million  or  to million in  from million in the commissions generated by the insurance division totaled million in  compared with million recorded in service charges on deposit accounts increased by million  or  to million in  from million in earnings on bank owned life insurance totaled million in  compared with million in noninterest expense increased million  or  to million in  compared with million during for a detailed discussion of these income and expense categories  see noninterest income and expense 
because of an increase in pre tax income  income tax expense was million in  compared to million for the effective tax rate for was  compared to for these effective tax rates are impacted by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation 
the effective rate in is higher than due to higher pre tax income without a corresponding increase in income items not subject to federal or state taxation 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during 
table of contents net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income decreased by million and interest expense decreased million 
the increase in net interest income is attributable to a decrease in the interest rate paid on deposits and a million increase in average loans to billion during  from billion in the increase in average loans is a result of continued management emphasis on loan growth and continued strength in some of the economies in the markets served by alabama national 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset 
alabama national also experienced growth in its securities portfolio that contributed to the increase in net interest income in average securities totaled million in  compared to in average interest bearing liabilities increased million  to billion in despite the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  interest expense decreased million during all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during average time deposits increased million  to billion in  compared to million in the interest rate paid on time deposits decreased basis points to in also  average interest bearing transaction accounts and savings and money market deposits increased a combined million while the rate paid on these types of accounts decreased basis points 
alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the increased net interest margin during is due to alabama national s ability to reprice most of its time deposits at lower rates during the federal reserve bank reduced rates repeatedly during  causing the rates paid on time deposits originated in higher interest rate environments to be significantly above current rates 
as those time deposits matured  the funds either moved into transaction type deposit accounts or into other time deposit accounts at the lower current rates 
the result is that the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points while the rate earned on earning assets decreased by only basis points

table of contents alabama national  through two of its subsidiary banks  sponsors two defined benefit pension plans 
each of these plans has been frozen with regard to future benefit accruals and participation by new employees 
during  due to the current interest rate environment and poor performance of the equity markets  the discount rate and expected return on plan assets were lowered by management 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets were and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively for due to these changes  the pension plans obligations exceeded the fair value of the plan assets and alabama national chose to fully fund the obligations and contributed million to the plans 
as of december   the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected and accumulated benefit obligation for each pension plan

income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in net income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  compared to million during net interest income the largest component of alabama national s net income is its net interest income the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support its assets 
net interest income is determined by the yield earned on alabama national s earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets represents alabama national s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates the following table depicts  on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods indicated  certain information related to alabama national s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities

table of contents during  alabama national experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or  to million  compared with million in net interest income increased primarily due to a decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and an increase in the volume of average earning assets outstanding 
during  as time deposits originated in higher interest rate environments matured  alabama national was able to reprice these time deposits at current market rates  which were lower due to the federal reserve bank s rate reductions during the fourth quarter of and second quarter of as a result  during the average rate paid on time deposits was  as compared to s average rate of 
each category of interest bearing liabilities experienced a decrease in the average rate during as compared to  resulting in an overall decrease of basis points in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities from to the federal reserve bank s rate reductions also impacted the yield earned on interest earning assets 
the average yield earned on earning assets decreased basis points to during  compared to during the average yield earned on loans decreased basis points to  but this decrease in yield was offset by an increase in average volume such that interest income from loans increased million  despite the decreased yield 
the net interest margin for was negatively impacted by accelerated repayment on securities owned by alabama national  as the securities being repaid were at higher interest rates than the rates earned on federal funds sold and new securities purchased 
the average yield earned on securities owned by alabama national decreased by basis points to in  from in during the fourth quarter of  the net interest margin was  which was an increase over the second and third quarters of management anticipates the net interest margin to remain near current levels absent any rate changes by the federal reserve or significant changes in the general interest rate environment 

table of contents analysis of changes in net interest income the following table sets forth  on a taxable equivalent basis  the effect which varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates had on changes in net interest income for and for purposes of this table  changes that are not solely attributable to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate on a pro rata basis

the principal monitoring technique employed by alabama national is simulation analysis  which technique is augmented by gap analysis 
in simulation analysis  alabama national reviews each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments 
these projected behaviors are based upon management s past experiences and upon current competitive environments  including the various environments in the different markets in which alabama national competes 
using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs  the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income 
alabama national also periodically verifies the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models 
see market risk 

table of contents another technique used by alabama national in interest rate management is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities  selling securities available for sale or trading securities  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
alabama national evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing  and sources and prices of off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk 
alabama national uses computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios 
the modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time 
the following table illustrates alabama national s interest rate sensitivity at december   assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid  respectively  based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities 
interest sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands  except ratios december  within one month after one through three months after three through twelve months within one year one through three years greater than three years total a s s e t s earning assets loans and leases securities trading securities interest bearing deposits in other banks funds sold total interest earning assets l i a b i l i t i e s interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits funds purchased short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans of million excludes investment in equity securities with a fair market value of million excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing 
includes treasury  tax and loan accounts of million 
table of contents alabama national generally benefits from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap a positive number and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive a negative number 
as shown in the table above  alabama national is asset sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout the one year time frame  although it is liability sensitive during the three through twelve month period 
alabama national is also asset sensitive during the one through three year time frame and liability sensitive in the greater than three years period  although it remains asset sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout all periods 
the current asset sensitive position is similar to the year end interest sensitivity analysis 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
for this and other reasons  management relies more upon the simulation analysis as noted above in managing interest rate risk 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk alabama national s earnings are dependent  to a large degree  on its net interest income which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
alabama national s market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in its lending  investing and deposit gathering activities 
alabama national seeks to reduce its exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing its interest rate risk 
management relies upon static gap analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which quantifies  to a large extent  the degree of market risk inherent in alabama national s balance sheet 
gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates 
simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from basis points below adjusted in the current period due to historically low interest rates to basis points above the current prevailing rates 
management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources 
with respect to the primary earning assets  loans and securities  certain features of individual types of loans and specific securities introduce uncertainty as to their expected performance at varying levels of interest rates 
in some cases  prepayment options exist whereby the borrower may elect to repay the obligation at any time 
these prepayment options make anticipating the performance of those instruments difficult given changes in prevailing rates 
at december   mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of million  or of total assets  and essentially every loan and lease  net of unearned income  totaling billion  or of total assets  carried such prepayment options 
management believes that assumptions used in its simulation analysis about the performance of financial instruments with such prepayment options are appropriate 
however  the actual performance of these financial instruments may differ from management s estimates due to several factors  including the diversity and financial sophistication of the customer base  the general level of prevailing interest rates and the relationship to their historical levels  and general economic conditions 
the difference between those assumptions and actual results  if significant  could cause the actual results to differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
deposits totaled billion  or  of total assets at december  since deposits are the primary funding source for earning assets  the associated market risk is considered by management in its simulation analysis 
generally  it is anticipated that deposits will be sufficient to support funding requirements 
however  the rates paid for deposits at varying levels of prevailing interest rates have a significant impact on net 
table of contents interest income and therefore  must be quantified by alabama national in its simulation analysis 
specifically  alabama national s spread  the difference between the rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  is generally higher when prevailing rates are higher 
as prevailing rates reduce  the spread tends to compress  with severe compression at very low prevailing interest rates 
this characteristic is called spread compression and adversely affects net interest income in the simulation analysis when anticipated prevailing rates are reduced from current rates 
management relies upon historical experience to estimate the degree of spread compression in its simulation analysis 
management believes that such estimates of possible spread compression are reasonable 
however  if the degree of spread compression varies from that expected  the actual results could differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
the following tables illustrate the results of simulation analysis used by alabama national to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased the specified amounts from current rates 
due to the current low interest rate environment  alabama national has elected to model interest rate decreases of and basis points 
this would equate to federal funds rates of and  respectively 
as of year end  management did not prepare a scenario that decreased current rates by basis points so the comparable scenario is not available for the current rates paid on interest bearing accounts cannot decrease below zero  yet rates earned on loans can experience a decrease in the falling rate scenarios  and the interest rate spread would therefore compress 
as noted above  however  management does not anticipate having the ability to reduce liability costs as successfully as if it were to experience a rate cut of a greater magnitude 
as also noted above  this model uses estimates and assumptions in both balance sheet growth and asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates 
because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model used to derive this market risk information  the actual results of the future impact of market risk on alabama national s net interest margin may differ from that found in the tables

table of contents provision and allowance for loan and lease losses alabama national has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan and lease portfolio including timely identification of potential problem credits 
on a monthly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this review and analysis is based on the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets and a review of historical statistical data  current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans and leases  the existence and effect of concentrations of credit  and changes in national and local economic conditions for both alabama national and other financial institutions 
management also considers in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses the results of regulatory examinations conducted for each bank  including evaluation of alabama national s policies and procedures and findings from alabama national s independent loan review department 
the provision for loan and lease losses decreased by million  or  to million in  from million in the decreased provision expense during is attributable to a reduction in net charge offs during and also a reduction in total nonperforming assets 
during  net charge offs decreased million  or to million  compared to million in as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  a million decrease from year end levels 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on alabama national s past loan and lease loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan and lease losses  at its current level  adequately covers alabama national s exposure to loan and lease losses 
while management believes that it has established the allowance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that in the future alabama national s regulators or its economic environment will not require further increases in the allowance 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that alabama national will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through a specific reserve allocation which is a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan and lease losses on alabama national s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate level as determined by management

accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
in addition to consideration of these factors  alabama national has a consistent and continuing policy of placing all loans on nonaccrual status if they become days or more past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest which is accrued on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both

potential problem loans a potential problem loan is one that management has concerns regarding the borrower s future performance under terms of the loan contract 
these loans are current as to principal and interest  and accordingly  they are not included in the nonperforming asset categories

nbc securities expanded its retail investment platform in with the addition of several registered representatives and the opening of several new offices during the year and s continued revenue increase reflected this expansion 
asset management fees recorded by the trust department of nbc and nbc securities also increased during as a result of an increase in the total assets managed by these divisions 
nbc securities also benefited from increased customer demand for fixed rate annuity products during and the decrease in interest income in both and is due to decreased margin loan activity during each year

in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in alabama national s market areas  and for alabama national in particular  to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 

table of contents the principal component of alabama national s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at year end  this category totaled billion and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to billion  or of the total loan portfolio at year end residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  commercial mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december  increases in both of these categories of loans are primarily the result of alabama national s expertise in and appetite for these commercial and residential real estate loans 
in addition  the general economic conditions in alabama national s markets  which generate such lending opportunities  are partially responsible for this growth 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  alabama national s focus on the home construction market and strong commercial construction activity in markets it serves led to this increase 
consumer loans  lease financing receivables and margin loan balances were relatively flat from december  as compared with year end totals 
the repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for alabama national 
the following table sets forth alabama national s loans maturing within specific intervals at december  loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates amounts in thousands december  one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial consumer predetermined rates floating rates maturing after one year but within five years maturing after five years the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
securities securities  including securities classified as held to maturity or investment securities and available for sale  represent a significant portion of alabama national s earning assets 
securities averaged million during  compared with million during  an increase of million  or 
growth in the securities portfolio is generally a function of growth in funding sources net of lending opportunities 
during  as loan demand experienced a relative decrease as compared with recent years  alabama national had excess liquidity with which to purchase securities 
management attempts to maintain earning asset growth commensurate with its funding growth and with its overall growth plans 
during  alabama national experienced increasing liquidity and a reduction in its rate of loan growth and increased the size of the securities portfolio through purchases 
at december   the securities portfolio totaled million  including securities held to maturity with an amortized cost of million and securities available for sale with a market value of million

at december   mortgage backed securities consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations had a carrying value totaling million 
these mortgage backed securities include million classified as investment securities and million classified as securities available for sale 
management expects the annual repayment of the underlying mortgages to vary as a result of monthly repayment of principal and or interest required under terms of the underlying promissory notes 
further  the actual rate of repayment is subject to changes depending upon the terms of the underlying mortgages  the relative level of mortgage interest rates  and the structure of the securities 
when relative interest rates decline to levels below that of the underlying mortgages  acceleration of principal repayment is expected as some borrowers on the underlying mortgages refinance to lower rates 
when the underlying rates on mortgage loans are comparable to  or in excess of  market rates  repayment more closely conforms to scheduled amortization in accordance with terms of the promissory note with additional repayment as a result of sales of homes collateralizing the mortgage loans constituting the security 
accordingly  management generally expects repayment of the collateralized mortgage obligations over a one to three year period  and repayment of the pass through mortgage obligations over a two to four year period 
these periods have shortened considerably due to the current interest rate environment 
other attributes of securities are discussed in interest sensitivity and market risk 
short term investments alabama national utilizes overnight investment of funds in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell to ensure that adequate liquidity will be maintained  while at the same time minimizing the level of uninvested cash reserves

this small dollar amount reflects management s policy of limiting positions in such securities to reduce its exposure to market and interest rate changes

borrowed funds borrowed funds include five broad categories  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan balances  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  borrowings from a third party bank  and junior subordinated debentures 
because of a relatively high loan to deposit ratio  the existence and stability of these funding sources are critical to alabama national s maintenance of short term and long term liquidity 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent both an input of excess funds from correspondent bank customers of alabama national as well as a cash management tool offered to corporate customers 
at december   these funds totaled million  compared with million at december  this balance will vary greatly depending on the liquidity of the downstream correspondent banks of alabama national and the excess cash of its corporate customers

liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring alabama national s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of an entity to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  alabama national will not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
increased liquidity in typical interest rate environments often involves decreasing profits by investing in earning assets with shorter maturities 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of certain securities within the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
assets included in alabama national s consolidated statements of condition contribute to liquidity management 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  alabama national s primary source of immediate liquidity  averaged million during and were million at december   and averaged million during and were million at december  if required in short term liquidity management  these assets could be converted to cash immediately 
cash received from the repayment of investment securities and loans provides a repetitive source of cash that contributes to

the federal home loan bank provides secured and unsecured credit lines to all of alabama national s banks totaling approximately million as of year end at december   advances under these lines totaled million  including million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
long term liquidity needs are met through alabama national s deposit base approximately of alabama national s deposits at december   are considered core deposits  and the repayment of loans and other investments as they mature 
alabama national is able to manage its long term liquidity needs by adjusting the rates it pays on longer term deposits  long term borrowings and the amount and mix of longer term investments in its portfolio 
one of the banks  nbc  has pledged approximately million in loans to the federal reserve bank of atlanta as collateral for a discount window credit facility  which management views as a backup liquidity facility 
at december   nbc had access to approximately million under this facility  with no outstanding borrowings 
alabama national  as a stand alone corporation  has more limited access to liquidity sources than its banks and depends on dividends from its subsidiaries as its primary source of liquidity 
alabama national s liquidity is diminished by required payments on its outstanding short term debt and junior subordinated debentures 
the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions  which may  but are not expected to  have a material negative impact on the liquidity available to alabama national 
see note to the alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning at page f 
if circumstances warrant  alabama national s short term liquidity needs can also be met by additional borrowings of approximately million representing the unused portion of alabama national s credit facility with an unrelated bank

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin states that if a business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest 
table of contents entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
due to significant implementation concerns  the fasb modified the wording of fin and issued fin r in december fin r deferred the effective date for the provisions of fin to entities other than special purpose entities spes until financial statements are issued for periods ending after march  spes are subject to the provisions of either fin or fin r as of december  management has evaluated the company s investment in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in limited liability partnerships involved in low income housing development lihtc and trust preferred securities structures because these entities or transactions constitute alabama national s primary fin and fin r exposure 
management determined that alabama national is not the primary beneficiary of the lihtc investments and accordingly the partnerships were not consolidated 
alabama national s interest in these partnerships as of december  totaled  during  alabama national also analyzed the impact of fin and fin r on certain trusts of alabama national and determined that certain trusts created by the company to issue trust preferred securities would require deconsolidation due to the provisions of fin and fin r 
accordingly  as of december  alabama national was required to deconsolidate these trusts 
this deconsolidation required alabama national to record junior subordinated debentures payable to trusts of  eliminate the guaranteed beneficial interest in subordinated debentures of  and record alabama national s investment in the trusts of  in other assets 
in july  the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter instructing bank holding companies to continue to include the trust preferred securities in tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes until further notice 
the federal reserve intends to review the regulatory implications of any accounting treatment changes and  if necessary  provide further appropriate guidance 
however  there can be no assurance that the federal reserve will continue to allow institutions to include trust preferred securities in tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
currently  other than the impact described above from the deconsolidation of the trust preferred securities  the adoption of fin and fin r did not have a material impact on alabama national s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
interpretive guidance relating to fin and fin r is continuing to evolve and alabama national s management will continue to assess various aspects of consolidations and variable interest entity accounting as additional guidance becomes available

impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as alabama national and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on alabama national s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
see interest sensitivity and market risk 
industry developments certain recently enacted and proposed legislation could have an effect on both the costs of doing business and the competitive factors facing the financial institutions industry 
alabama national is unable at this time to assess the impact of this legislation on its financial condition or results of operations
