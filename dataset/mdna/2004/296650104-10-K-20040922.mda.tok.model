item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook during fiscal year  while net sales increased  new orders received by the company did not keep pace with backlog relieved 
thus  while the sales backlog of approximately million at june  gives the company a solid base of future sales  the company anticipates that the reduction of backlog may result in a reduction of sales during fiscal management also anticipates a concurrent reduction in costs 
management believes that existing customers have been delayed in placing orders for additional products  but anticipates that new orders will be received in the current calendar year which should result in a significant increase in backlog 
many potential orders are currently being discussed and negotiated with our customers 
in addition to the backlog  the company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs 
based on management s communications with customers  the company expects to receive substantial orders for spare parts on the various types of transmitters which are already in service  a number of contracts for further development and manufacture of power supplies  transformers and additional contracts for pre engineered hardware 
we expect these contracts to substantially increase sales in years beyond the outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies  transformers  and subassemblies 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above  many of which are subject to allocations of the united states defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally 
results of operations net sales for fiscal years ended june   and  were   and  respectively 
the increase in net sales in as compared to  is the result of increased transmitter component shipments on two of the company s products 
in fiscal  the company continued to realize the benefits of increased business with existing customers and continued to establish new customer relationships 
enhanced customer relationships and the quality of our products have provided for the continued increase in sales that has occurred over the last five years 
the sales backlog at june   as discussed above includes significant orders for land and shipboard high voltage radar power supply transmitters  industrial power supplies  and contracts to manufacture certain customer products in accordance with pre engineered requirements 
the increase in net sales in as compared to was the result of increased shipments of small transformers  certain power supplies  and shipments made on build to print orders 
the primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix 
the gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher than with respect to the products which are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production 
in any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts  has a significant impact on gross profit and net income 
for fiscal years ended june   and gross profits were   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit between  and was predominately due to an increase in net sales and favorable product mix 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
management continues to evaluate the company s workforce to ensure that production and overall execution of the backlog orders and additional anticipated orders are successfully performed 
employment at june  was people compared to people at june  net income for fiscal  was  or 
and 
per share  basic and diluted  respectively  compared to  or 
per share  both basic and diluted  for fiscal the change in net income per share was due to increased sales and improved gross profit offset primarily by one loss contract and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
net income for fiscal  was  or 
per share compared to net income of  or 
per share for fiscal the increase in net income per share was due to decreased expenditures made on engineering development contracts  higher sales and favorable product mix 
the decrease in engineering development expenditures occurred naturally as the related programs moved from the engineering design phase into the production phase of the associated contracts 
the increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or as compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees  insurance costs and administrative salaries 
the increase in professional fees was attributable  in part  to legal fees incurred relating to the review conducted by the american stock exchange following the company s annual meeting in november and the implementation of corporate governance modifications  including the amendment of the corporate by laws 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended june   an increase of  or as compared to the prior year 
this increase is mainly attributable to an increase in insurance premiums and increased selling expenses 
other income for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal due to lower dividend and interest income 
the company does not believe that there is significant risk associated with its investment policy  since at june  all of the investments are primarily represented by short term liquid investments including certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
total other income in fiscal  as compared to declined as expected  as the company sold its higher interest bearing preferred securities  and interest rates continued to decline 
the effective income tax rate was in  in  and in the effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the foreign exportation benefit the company receives on its foreign sales 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business  and during the past three fiscal years  the company  when possible  has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments 
the company did not borrow any funds during the last three fiscal years 
management has available a  line of credit to help fund further growth or working capital needs  if necessary  but does not anticipate the need for any borrowed funds in the foreseeable future 
the company s working capital as of june   and was   and  respectively 
during  and the company repurchased   and shares  respectively  of its common stock from the company s employee retirement plan and trust esop and in other open market transactions  for a total purchase price of   and  respectively 
under existing authorizations from the company s board of directors  as of june   management is authorized to purchase an additional  of company stock 
the table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal year indicated net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used provided by investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in net income  the timing of the collection of accounts receivable  purchases of inventory  receipt of progress payments  level of sales and payments of accounts payable 
net cash used provided by investing activities changed in fiscal due to slightly lower additions of plant and equipment and the purchase of short term investments 
the increase in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to the increase in the amount of dividends paid during as compared to the company believes that the cash generated from operations and when necessary  from existing cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to meet its long term funding requirements for the foreseeable future 
management believes that the company s reserve for bad debts of  is adequate given the customers with whom the company does business 
historically  bad debt expense has been minimal 
during fiscal year and  the company expended  and  respectively  for plant improvements and new equipment 
the company has budgeted approximately  for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal management presently anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations 
the company has entered into standby letters of credit agreements with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
contingent liabilities on outstanding standby letters of credit agreements aggregated approximately  at june  the company does not expect to fund any of the amounts under the standby letters of credit 
the company has an operating lease for a month which expires june  critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts 
revenue recognition and estimates a significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts 
generally revenues on long term fixed price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion 
percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales  estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule 
contract costs include material  subcontract costs  labor and an allocation of overhead costs 
the estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract 
given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above  it is possible that materially different amounts of contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used  based on changes in circumstances  in the estimation of cost at completion 
when a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined  changes are reflected in current period earnings 
other matters an employee retirement plan and trust esop was established for the eligible non union employees of the company  effective as of july  the esop used the proceeds of a loan from the company made on june  to purchase  shares of the company s common stock for approximately  and the company contributed approximately  in to the esop  which was used by the esop to purchase an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
each year the company makes contributions to the esop  which are used to make loan interest and principal payments 
with each loan and interest payment  a portion of the common stock is allocated to participating employees 
as of june   there were  shares allocated to participants 
dividends attributable to allocated shares were likewise allocated to the participants accounts  whereas the dividends on unallocated shares were used toward the loan repayment  thus reducing the company s required contribution
