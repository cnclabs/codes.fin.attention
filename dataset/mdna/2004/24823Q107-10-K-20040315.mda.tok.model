item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted therapies for cancer 
our portfolio of product candidates includes therapeutic vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  small molecules and pro drugs to treat a wide range of cancers 
the product candidates most advanced in development are therapeutic vaccines designed to stimulate a patient s immune system for the treatment of cancer 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge  a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations  clinical trial expenses and marketing expenses 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop systems that support commercialization 
we anticipate that we will not generate revenue from the sale of commercial therapeutic products in the near future 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations with revenue received from collaborations  milestone payments and license fees from our current or future collaborators and our available cash resources 
the timing and level of funding from our existing or future collaborations will fluctuate based upon the success of our research programs  our ability to meet milestones and receipt of approvals from government regulators 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of increased research and clinical trial activity 
clinical costs may grow at a faster rate compared to research and preclinical expenses as we enroll patients into our second phase provenge trial  db 
provenge provenge is our therapeutic vaccine being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer 
prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor malignancy in men in the united states  with over one million men currently diagnosed with the disease 
we are currently conducting a pivotal  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trial of provenge  db  at more than centers in the united states 
this trial is designed to test provenge in men with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer whose cancer has a gleason score of and less and to confirm results of our first phase trial of provenge that indicated significant clinical benefit in delaying time to disease progression and delaying the onset of disease related pain in this population 
androgen independent prostate cancer is an advanced stage of prostate cancer in which the tumor growth is no longer regulated by androgens  or male hormones 
currently  there are no fda approved therapeutic treatment options for patients with aipc 
the gleason score is the most commonly used prostate cancer scoring system and is considered one of the most important prognostic indicators for prostate cancer 
the gleason score is a measure of the aggressiveness of a patient s tumor and ranges in score from to it is widely accepted within the medical community that gleason scores of and less suggest a better prognosis than gleason scores of and higher 
approximately of androgen independent  and approximately of androgen dependent  prostate cancer patients have a gleason score of and less 
the results from our first phase placebo controlled trial of provenge  d  in men with metastatic asymptomatic aipc were first announced in august comparison of the provenge treated group to the placebo treated group in the overall population showed a benefit in delaying time to disease progression  the primary endpoint of the trial 
although the results of the d trial did not achieve statistical significance for the overall population  p value  these results closely approached statistical significance at p value 
for provenge treated men with gleason scores of and less  however  the results demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in delaying time to disease progression  p value 
for these men  the probability of remaining progression free while on the study was over two times higher than for men treated with placebo 
in addition  six months after randomization  these men had a greater than eight fold advantage in progression free survival compared to men who received placebo of provenge men versus of placebo patients 
in december  we announced additional results from d indicating that  in addition to delaying the time to progression of disease  provenge treatment also delayed the onset of disease related pain in men with gleason scores of and less 
delay in the onset of disease related pain was the secondary endpoint of d  which enrolled patients who did not have cancer related pain at the time of entry into the study 
in men with gleason scores of and less  those receiving treatment with provenge remained pain free significantly longer than those receiving placebo  p value 
in addition  for these men  the probability of remaining free of cancer related pain while on the study was over two and one half times higher than for patients who received placebo 
provenge treatment was generally well tolerated  with most side effects resolving within to hours 
on january   we announced interim survival data from d for men with gleason scores of and less 
based on data accumulated as of december  men with gleason scores of and less receiving provenge had a significant survival advantage  having on average an overall increase in their survival time as compared to placebo log rank p  hazard ratio 
this benefit is reflected by a prolongation in the median survival time in these men receiving provenge by months months versus months 
at months from randomization  the survival rate for provenge treated men in this population is times higher than for men receiving placebo versus  p value 
in june  we received an agreement under a special protocol assessment  or spa  from the fda for db 
the spa provides a binding written agreement with the fda that the design and planned analysis of db will form a basis for a biologics license application  if the trial is successful in meeting its pre determined objectives 
we have also received fast track designation for provenge for metastatic asymptomatic  aipc  for tumors with gleason scores of and less from the fda 
fast track designation allows for a rolling submission of a potential biologics license application with the fda  and ordinarily provides for a priority review 
priority review is defined by the fda as a six month review cycle 
if db is completed as currently planned  the results meet the trial endpoints  and we are successful in completing other necessary tasks  we would expect to submit a biologics license application for provenge in apc we are also conducting phase clinical trials for apc  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of breast  ovarian and other solid tumors 
preliminary results from a trial in breast cancer indicate that apc is showing clinical benefit and targeted t cell mediated immune responses in patients with advanced  metastatic  her positive breast cancer 
we are presently designing phase trials of apc  and expect to commence a phase trial in preclinical research and development programs we have a number of preclinical research and development programs underway 
our collaboration with genentech targets the development of monoclonal antibodies and potentially other products directed against trp p  a cancer specific ion channel 
we have a monoclonal antibody program that targets hla dr and the use of antibodies directed to this target to kill cancer cells that express this molecule as well as additional potential therapeutic vaccines in preclinical development 
as a result of the acquisition of corvas  we obtained its protease activated therapy pact therapeutic platform 
the pact program focuses on exploiting the activity of proteases on the surface of tumor cells 
proteases are enzymes that act as molecular scissors that cleave other proteins 
pact involves the design of synthetic molecules composed of a sequence of amino acids that are selectively recognized by a targeted  cancer associated serine protease 
the peptide moiety is chemically attached to a known cancer chemotherapeutic or cytoxic drug  yielding a pro drug 
this highly targeted approach may reduce damage to normal  healthy tissue through the activation of the pro drug only at the location of the tumor by the tumor specific serine protease 
we also obtained corvas membrane bound serine protease inhibitor preclinical program that focuses primarily on membrane associated proteases that have been implicated in supporting the growth and progression of several types of solid tumors  including prostate  breast  ovarian and colorectal cancers 
our collaboration with abgenix  inc is focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibodies against the membrane bound serine protease  matriptase 
under the terms of the collaboration  abgenix will use its human antibody technologies to generate and select antibodies against matriptase 
both companies will have the right to co develop and commercialize  or  it co development is not elected  to solely develop and commercialize  any antibody products discovered during the collaboration 
both companies will share equally in the product development costs and any profits from sales of products successfully commercialized from co development efforts 
we also have a collaboration with dyax corp 
to discover  develop and commercialize antibody  small protein and peptide inhibitors for two endotheliase enzymes that corvas isolated and characterized 
under the terms of this agreement  both companies will jointly develop any inhibitory agents that may be identified and will share commercialization rights and profits  if any  from any marketed products 
on july   we completed the acquisition of corvas and corvas became a wholly owned subsidiary of dendreon operating as dendreon san diego llc  a limited liability company 
on december   we announced the closure of the san diego operations acquired through the acquisition of corvas 
the closure allows us to focus our resources on optimizing the value of key assets and to obtain future operating efficiencies 
in connection with the closure  we recognized  in reorganization expenses in december  and anticipate recognizing an additional approximately million in the first quarter of unless otherwise indicated  the discussion in this report of the results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and financial condition at december  include the results of operations of corvas  commencing from july  the results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and and the financial condition as of december   include only the historical results of dendreon 
critical accounting policies and estimates cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the amounts are recorded at cost  which approximate fair market value 
our cash equivalents  short and long term investments consist principally of commercial paper  money market securities  corporate bonds notes and certificates of deposit 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization and accretion are included in interest income 
interest earned on securities is included in interest income 
we consider an investment with a maturity greater than twelve months long term and a maturity less than twelve months short term 
impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets required losses from impairment of long lived assets used in operations to be recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments  milestone payments  and personnel supported research funding 
we recognize license revenue from intellectual technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
up front payments up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones revenue is recognized as if the payment was an up front fee 
personnel supported research funding under these agreements  research and development activities are performed by designated full time equivalent personnel fte during a specified funding period 
the fte funding rate is an agreed upon rate comparable to other rates for similar research and development services 
payments received in advance of the research and development activities performed are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the related funding period 
our performance is on a best efforts basis with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success 
license fees non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
product sales revenue from product supply agreements is recorded when the product is shipped  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  amounts are deemed to be collectible and all other obligations under the agreements are met 
grant revenue revenue related to grant agreements is recognized as related research and development expenses are incurred 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the value of acquired ipr d is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and overhead costs 
use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  financing operations  long term service contracts  and other contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
fair value of financial instruments at december   the carrying value of accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities approximates fair value based on the liquidity of these financial instruments or their short term nature 
the carrying value of capital lease obligations approximates fair value based on the market interest rates available to us for debt of similar risk and maturities 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
states that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for a liability for one time termination benefits that are incurred over a period of time 
the standard applies to us for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in december  we announced the closure of our san diego operations recently acquired through our acquisition of corvas 
see note of notes to financial statements for a detailed listing of costs incurred related to the closure of our san diego operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
at the november  meeting  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses revenue recognition for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus is applicable to agreements entered into in our third quarter of  with early adoption permitted 
to the extent that an arrangement is within the scope of other existing higher level authoritative literature that provides guidance regarding whether or how to separate multiple deliverable arrangements into separate units of accounting  the arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with that literature 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
requires accounting policy note disclosures to provide the method of stock option accounting for each year presented in the financial statements and  for each year until all years presented in the financial statements recognize the fair value of stock based compensation 
also  sfas no 
provides two additional transition methods that eliminate the ramp up effect resulting from applying the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
the transition provisions and annual statement disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas the statement is effective with certain exceptions for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  and in october  deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to december  for interests held by public companies in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on may   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity fas no 

the standard requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance could be accounted for as equity  be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
fas no 
represents a significant change in practice in accounting for a number of financial instruments  including mandatory redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with share repurchase programs 
fas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective for us at the beginning of our third quarter of the adoption of fas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue was million in  million in and million in the increase compared with was primarily due to increased kirin license and milestone revenue recognized as a result of our agreement with kirin entered into in november partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to the expiration of our collaboration with the johnson johnson pharmaceutical research and development  llc  or j j prd 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized kirin fte revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase compared to was predominantly due to revenue recognized under our agreement with kirin partially offset by lower j j prd revenue 
in  we expect lower collaborative and license revenue due to the end of our collaborations with kirin 
in november  we announced that we had reached an agreement to license to kirin worldwide patent rights relating to the use of certain hla dr antibodies being developed by kirin for which kirin agreed to pay us million and released its rights to our therapeutic vaccines including our lead product candidate  provenge  in asia and pacific rim countries 
this agreement ends our collaboration with kirin and  we are now able to pursue a collaboration for provenge worldwide 
the million will be paid to us in cash in four installments  of which million was paid in december  and million is to be paid annually for three years thereafter 
we recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of of million related to this agreement  representing the payments received and to be received from kirin  net of a discount of for interest 
in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of monoclonal antibody and potentially other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
we will be jointly responsible with genentech for conducting preclinical and clinical work 
genentech will fund a majority of these expenses for products that reach phase clinical trials 
genentech will also be responsible for all manufacturing of resulting products 
the agreement provides for profit sharing and commercialization in the united states 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term 
genentech will make other option and milestone payments to us upon achievement of product development goals 
during the years ended december  and we recognized revenue of  and  respectively  related to this agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase compared with was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing and clinical trial expenses as well as increased personnel related costs and facilities expense due to the integration of corvas into our operations 
the decrease compared with was predominantly due to reduced clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs during the partial clinical hold from april to october of da  our second phase clinical trial of provenge 
financial data from our research and development related activities is compiled and managed by us as follows clinical programs  and discovery research 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs cancer cardiovascular from our acquisition of corvas indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes  and other employee related expenses including rent  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  our discovery research program costs are not assigned to specific projects 
the aggregate costs of our research and development collaborative agreements include discovery research and clinical efforts where drug technology is developed across our vaccine  monoclonal antibody and small molecule technology platforms 
our collaborative partners enjoy the benefit from the discoveries and knowledge generated across these platforms 
the majority of our collaborative agreements involve an exchange of potential rights in the territories and indications or field of science  as defined in the respective agreements  in exchange for cash payments 
our collaborative agreements track deliverables based on measures around scientific progress to which we and our partners agree on a periodic basis  primarily quarterly 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for sale by the necessary government agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
in october  we licensed rights to telomerase from geron 
we paid a license fee at inception of  shares of our common stock valued at  and we paid geron a second license fee in cash of  in october  the first anniversary of the agreement 
in addition  if we achieve certain milestones  we are obligated to make additional payments to geron 
the first milestone payment is due upon the submission of the first investigational new drug application  or ind  for a product incorporating telomerase and the second is due upon submission of the first biologics license application  or bla  to the fda 
three subsequent milestone payments are due upon submission of the second bla or equivalent  and upon the first and second product approvals  if any 
the agreement may be terminated by us without cause on sixty days written notice to geron 
in  there were no milestone payments due 
in september  dendreon licensed rights to the cea and mn antigens from bayer corporation in two separate agreements 
we paid a license fee upon execution of each agreement  and made milestone payments of  under each of the license agreements in april additional milestone payments will be due at the start of phase clinical trials of products incorporating cea or mn and the first approval for marketing authorization by the fda of such products  if successful 
royalties on sales of any products incorporating cea or mn will be due to bayer if and when commercial sales of such products commence 
preclinical and clinical studies require relatively small amounts of our antigen delivery cassette 
to produce commercial quantities of the antigen delivery cassette for provenge requires that we develop manufacturing processes to permit the production of much larger quantities of that protein 
to assist us to scale up to commercial levels of production of the antigen delivery cassette used in provenge  we contracted with diosynth in march we and diosynth have since agreed to modifications to the original work plan to allow us to progressively designate work to be done in discrete blocks that are negotiated with diosynth at a specified price 
a separate cancellation fee applies in the event that we cancel any such block of work 
certain blocks of work have been agreed upon and are being performed pursuant to the modified agreement and we are discussing additional blocks of work with diosynth 
the modification of the agreement allows us greater flexibility in scheduling the availability of its facilities and personnel 
in light of the results from our first phase clinical trial of provenge  d  and our ongoing phase pivotal clinical trial of provenge  db  we presently intend to continue the work for scale up to commercial level production 
acquired in process research and development 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred an expense of million associated with the write off of the acquired in process research and development ipr d related to the corvas acquisition 
the million of ipr d represents the purchase price allocation to ipr d initially based on an estimate of the fair value of in process technology for projects of corvas that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in  and million in the increase in compared with was primarily due to increased personnel  legal  consulting and administrative expenses  partially due to the integration of corvas into our operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was primarily due to the allocation of rent related to the unoccupied portion of the facility in mountain view  california  from research and development to general and administrative expenses 
in august  we entered into an asset purchase agreement and cell processing agreement with progenitor cell therapy  llp  or pct  by which pct acquired our mountain view  california cell processing operations 
under the terms of the agreement  pct paid fees to us of  in each of and and has assumed operational  lease and personnel obligations for the cell processing facility 
we currently anticipate general and administrative spending to increase over levels due to costs associated with the closure of our san diego operations and increased personnel to support the provenge db clinical trial 
marketing 
marketing expenses decreased to  in from  in  and million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower medical and market research spending  and a reduction in personnel 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower advertising and medical education expenses as a result of the partial clinical hold on our phase clinical trial of provenge  da 
marketing expenses are expected to be higher in than in  as we continue market research and trial recruitment activities associated with provenge 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  and million in the decreases in and were due to the decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
interest income is expected to be higher in than in due to a higher average cash balance and interest to be recognized related to the payment installments of the kirin agreement signed in november interest expense 
interest expense was  in compared to  in and  in the increase compared with was primarily due to interest expense of  related to artisan debt of million acquired as part of our acquisition of corvas 
in september the debt was paid in cash and the accreted interest was paid in stock 
the decrease compared with was primarily attributable to lower average balances of debt associated with capital lease obligations and as a result of the repayment of the transamerica note in february foreign income tax expense 
foreign income tax expense was million  of which is deferred  in  compared with  in and in the amounts in and related to japanese withholding tax on certain payments received and due to be received from kirin 
net operating loss at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future federal taxable income 
if not utilized  the tax net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in the ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before those losses and carryforwards are fully utilized 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange for services 
in we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  related to the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed in the corvas merger 
we also recorded deferred stock based compensation of  related to restricted stock awards granted to members of our management team that vest upon grant and the balance over a two year period 
we recorded an expense of  in in connection with these awards 
we recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing them by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of  in   in and million in we expect amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense to be approximately  and  in and  respectively 
we expect to reverse deferred compensation of approximately  related to terminations in connection with the closure of our san diego facility in the first quarter of we recorded stock based consulting expense of   and  in  and  respectively  related to grants to non employees 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments were million at december  we have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from the sale of our equity securities  cash receipts from collaboration arrangements  interest income earned  equipment lease financings and loan facilities 
in connection with the july  acquisition of corvas we acquired million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses 
in  and  these expenditures were offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators including license fees from kirin in  research and development expense reimbursements from kirin and j j prd  license fees from genentech  and cash received from non refundable  upfront payments and milestone payments received from kirin in we expect net cash used in operating activities to increase in the future as a result of increased research and clinical trial activity  and commercialization activities related to provenge 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
we have an agreement with transamerica  a financing company  under which we have fully financed purchases of million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment 
the terms are from to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year  and we have granted a security interest in all our assets to transamerica 
in january  we entered into a million lease line with ge life sciences and technology financings 
as of december   we had financed  of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment under the ge lease line 
the lease terms are months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year 
this ge lease line expired on june  in november  we entered into a million lease line with ge life sciences and technology financings 
as of december   we had financed  of laboratory  computer and office equipment under this ge lease line 
the lease term is months and bears interest at per year 
this ge agreement will expire on december  we had a tenant improvement allowance of million from the lessor of our primary seattle  washington facility 
as of december   we had committed all of the allowance for laboratory and manufacturing space at this facility 
the improvement allowance bears interest at the rate of per year and is repaid monthly over the length of the original lease 
in  we plan to continue to fund our capital equipment and leasehold improvements through financing facilities 
in june  we entered into a million equity line financing agreement  or equity line facility  with bny capital markets  inc  or cmi  a registered broker dealer  providing for the potential future issuance by us to cmi of shares of our common stock 
under the equity line facility  cmi has committed to purchase  subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions  up to million of our common stock until the expiration of the agreement on june  we may issue common stock under the equity line facility with a value equal to no less than  and no more than million per drawdown period  with each drawdown period lasting from one to five trading days  at our discretion 
cmi is obligated  subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and compliance of the drawdown with specified restrictions  to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount of to the closing price of one share of our common stock on the nasdaq national market or to the actual sales price per share for shares sold by cmi on the trading days during a drawdown period and in the circumstances set forth in the equity line financing agreement 
we may deliver as many separate drawdown notices to cmi as we choose during the term of the agreement  provided that we may not deliver a drawdown notice during any ongoing drawdown period 
we are under no obligation to issue any minimum number of drawdown requests 
if we do not issue at least million of our common stock to cmi under the equity line facility prior to its termination  we will pay cmi  pro rated for issuances prior to the termination 
we also agreed to pay future fees to shoreline pacific  llc  which assisted us as placement agent in this transaction  equal to of each drawdown under the equity line facility 
as of december   we had issued a total of  shares at an average price of under the equity line facility for gross proceeds of  less a total fee of  that included fees paid to shoreline pacific in the amount of of the gross proceeds  a one time administration fee to cmi  and other legal and accounting fees 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement sec file no 
with the sec to sell up to million of our common stock from time to time 
the sec declared this registration statement effective on january  in june  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  or  net of offering costs 
as of december    of common stock can be sold under this registration statement 
from the effective date of the registration statement through december   the proceeds from the offering were used to fund clinical trials  for research and preclinical development activities related to our potential products  for commercialization activities for our therapeutic vaccine product candidates  to increase our antigen presenting cell processing and antigen manufacturing capacity  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
under this registration statement  we may sell our common stock directly to purchasers  to or through underwriters or dealers  through agents  or through a combination of such methods 
we expect that the price for any such shares sold under this registration statement will reflect our negotiations with prospective investors  the market price of our common stock  recent trends in the market price of our common stock  other factors considered material by the prospective investors and  if applicable  any agents or underwriters involved with the sale or sales 
in july  our wholly owned subsidiary  dendreon san diego llc  acquired corvas 
as a result  corvas convertible senior subordinated promissory notes due in the notes became the obligation of dendreon san diego llc  and artisan equity ltd  the holder of the notes  exercised its right to cause the notes to be redeemed pursuant to a change in control provision in the notes 
in accordance with the redemption terms of the notes  we paid the principal of the notes to artisan in cash on september   and elected to pay accreted interest of approximately million on the notes in shares of our common stock 
artisan agreed to accept payment of the accreted interest in shares of our common stock in lieu of cash  provided that  among other things  the resale of the common stock issued in payment of the accreted interest was registered under the securities act 
on october   we filed a registration statement on form s to register the resale of  shares of our common stock by artisan to satisfy the terms of the note permitting payment in shares of our common stock 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on october   and  shares of our common stock were issued to artisan in full payment of the accreted interest 
we have agreed with artisan to prepare and file such amendments and supplements to the registration statement as may be necessary to keep the registration statement effective until the shares are no longer required to be registered for sale by artisan 
on october   we filed a second shelf registration statement sec file no 
with the sec to sell up to an additional million of our common stock from time to time 
the sec declared this registration statement effective on november  on january   we filed an additional shelf registration statement sec file no 
solely to increase the dollar amount of securities registered under our registration statement sec file no

in january  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million or million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations  including interest and unconditional purchase obligations in thousands contractual commitments total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations a other contractual commitments a total contractual commitments a refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to purchase obligations and other contractual commitments 
as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months 
with the proceeds of our public offering in the first quarter of  we anticipate our cash on hand  and cash generated from our collaboration arrangements  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing prior to that time 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of our common stock under the shelf registration statement  should we need them  or are unable to draw down on our equity line facility before its expiration when we need to do so because we cannot meet the required conditions or because we are otherwise restricted by the terms of our agreement with cmi from drawing down for example  each draw down is subject to a minimum floor closing price of  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials 
we may also consider additional financings if market conditions are favorable to enhance our cash and working capital position 
factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have a history of operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur losses  and we may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we do not have any products that generate material revenue from product sales or royalties 
operating losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development programs and from general and administrative expenses in support of operations  clinical trial expenses and marketing expenses 
we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for several years  and we may never do so 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  and these losses may increase significantly as we continue preclinical research and clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our product candidates  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support commercialization of our potential products 
these losses  among other things  have caused and may cause our stockholders equity and working capital to decrease 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our products  and our operations may not be profitable even if any of our product candidates are commercialized 
our nearer term prospects are highly dependent on provenge  our lead product candidate 
if we do not successfully complete our current phase pivotal clinical trial for provenge  the fda fails to approve provenge for commercialization or  if approved by the fda  we fail to successfully commercialize provenge  our business would be harmed and our stock price would likely fall 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge  a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer 
provenge is currently being tested in a pivotal phase clinical trial  db 
our first phase clinical trial for provenge  d  did not meet its main objective of showing a statistically significant delay in the median time to disease progression in the overall patient population in the study 
the trial results did  however  identify a group of patients who benefited by treatment with provenge 
although we have entered into an agreement under a special protocol assessment with the fda for our current pivotal trial and have received fast track designation for provenge from the fda  our obtaining fda approval of provenge depends on  among other things  our successfully completing db with favorable results and in accordance with the agreed upon protocol 
we might fail to complete or experience delays in completing this pivotal trial 
in addition  the data from this pivotal phase trial might not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of provenge or we may not be successful in meeting other requirements for approval 
even if we receive fda approval  we might not be successful in commercializing provenge 
if any of these things occur  our business would be harmed and the price of our common stock would likely fall 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of corvas 
the success of our acquisition of corvas will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and other opportunities from integrating the business of corvas with our business 
these opportunities include advancing product candidates through clinical trials  developing new product candidates from preclinical cancer programs and achieving cost savings to reduce our cash use 
in december  we announced the closure of the san diego operations acquired through the acquisition of corvas 
the closure is intended to allow us to focus our resources on optimizing the value of key assets and to obtain future operating efficiencies 
to efficiently manage the ongoing programs located in san diego  we are re locating essential activities to our headquarters in seattle 
this decision will result in a reduction in workforce at the san diego facility and certain non recurring expenses in the fourth quarter of of  and in the first quarter of  estimated at million 
difficulties we may face in combining the corvas operations with ours include  among others consolidating research and development operations  retaining and or recruiting employees with the scientific expertise necessary to continue preclinical programs that were being pursued at the san diego facility  selecting appropriate product candidates for further preclinical development or out licensing  preserving licensing  research and development  supply  collaboration and other important relationships  allocating the resources of the combined operation to optimize the development of programs with the greatest potential value  and achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and cost savings 
it is possible that we will be unable to realize all of the benefits that we expect to result from the acquisition of corvas and the combination of our operations in seattle 
integration of operations may be difficult and may have unintended and undesirable consequences 
we may not accomplish this integration as quickly or as smoothly or successfully as we would like 
the diversion of management s attention from our current operations to the integration effort and any difficulties in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits that we expect to result from the combination and could adversely affect our existing business 
the acquisition of corvas also entails an inherent risk that we could become subject to contingent or other liabilities  including liabilities arising from events or conduct pre dating our acquisition of corvas that were not known to us at the time of the acquisition 
if we fail to enter into collaboration agreements for our product candidates  if they are needed  we may be unable to commercialize them effectively or at all 
to successfully commercialize provenge  our potential product most advanced in development  we will need substantial financial resources and we will need to develop or access physical resources and systems  including cell processing centers  a distribution network  an information technology platform and sales and marketing and other resources that we currently do not have 
we may elect to develop some or all of these physical resources and systems and the related expertise ourselves or we may seek to collaborate with another biotechnology or pharmaceutical company which will provide some or all of such physical resources and systems as well as financial resources and expertise 
we are currently in discussions for a possible collaboration with respect to provenge with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who may provide such financial and physical resources  systems and expertise 
whether we negotiate such a collaboration and reach a definitive agreement will depend upon our assessment of the collaborator s resources and expertise  the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration  and the proposed collaborator s evaluation of a number of factors 
those factors may include the results of our first phase clinical trial of provenge and the potential results of our current pivotal phase clinical trial of provenge  the potential market for provenge  the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering provenge to patients  the potential of competing products  and industry and market conditions generally 
if we were to determine that a collaboration for provenge is necessary and were unable to enter into such a collaboration on acceptable terms  we might elect to delay or scale back the commercialization of provenge in order to preserve our financial resources or to allow us adequate time to develop the required physical resources and systems ourselves 
if we enter into a collaboration agreement we consider acceptable  the collaboration may not proceed as quickly  smoothly or successfully as we plan 
the risks in a collaboration agreement for provenge include the following the collaborator may independently develop  or develop with third parties  products that could compete with provenge  the collaborator may not apply the expected financial resources or required expertise in developing the physical resources and systems or other systems necessary to successfully commercialize provenge  the collaborator may not invest in the development of a sales and marketing force and the related infrastructure at levels that ensure that sales of provenge reach their full potential  and disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that delay the commercialization of provenge or adversely affect its sales or profitability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect the commercialization of provenge by delaying the date on which sales of the product may begin if approved by the fda  by slowing the pace of growth of such sales  by reducing the profitability of the product or by adversely affecting the reputation of the product in the market 
in addition  a collaborator for provenge may have the right to terminate the collaboration at its discretion 
any termination may require us to seek a new collaborator  which we may not be able to do on a timely basis  if at all  or require us to delay or scale back the commercialization efforts 
we may choose to enter into collaboration agreements for one or more of our other product candidates 
with respect to a collaboration for provenge or any of our other product candidates  we are dependent on the success of our collaborators in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our collaborators 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
problems with our collaborators  such as those mentioned above  could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we have a collaboration with genentech for the research  development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies and potentially other therapies targeting trp p we also have collaborations with abgenix for the research  development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies for two selected antigens from our portfolio of serine proteases  and dyax for the research  development and commercialization of cancer therapeutics focused on serine protease inhibitors 
each of these collaborations involve potential products that are at the preclinical stage of development  and we believe the risks described above that are associated with later stage products are less likely to materially impact us if they occur 
to date  we have not experienced difficulties with these collaborations that have had a material negative effect on our business or research and product development efforts  and we have not been negatively affected by consolidations involving potential collaborators 
however  it is possible that we could encounter difficulties with these collaborators in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may require additional funding  and our future access to capital is uncertain 
it is expensive to develop and commercialize cancer vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  small molecules and other new products 
we plan to continue to simultaneously conduct clinical trials and preclinical research for a number of product candidates  which is costly 
our product development efforts may not lead to commercial products  either because our product candidates fail to be found safe or effective in clinical trials or because we lack the necessary financial or other resources or relationships to pursue our programs through commercialization 
our capital and future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  the development of commercial infrastructure and the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical research 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund operations  continue the research and development of our therapeutic products  conduct clinical trials  and commercialize our products 
we believe that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing within this time frame depending on a number of factors  including the following the costs of developing the physical resources and systems to support fda approval of provenge  the costs of preparing an application for fda approval of provenge  if we seek such approval  our timetable for and costs of scaling up manufacturing  our timetable and costs for the development of marketing operations and other activities related to the commercialization of provenge and our other product candidates  our degree of success in our phase trial of provenge  db  and in clinical trials of our other products  the rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  the amount and timing of milestone payments we receive from collaborators  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  and changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may have to delay  reduce or eliminate our clinical trials and our development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  including under our equity line facility or pursuant to our shelf registration statement  further dilution to our existing stockholders will result 
we may take longer to complete our clinical trials than we project  or we may not be able to complete them at all 
a number of factors  including regulatory requirements  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  limits on manufacturing capacity  failure of doses of provenge to meet required standards and difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria may cause significant delays 
we may not complete our pivotal clinical trial of provenge or commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our other product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
we rely on academic institutions  physician practices and clinical research organizations to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our product candidates 
we have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own 
third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol 
we also rely on clinical research organizations to perform much of our data management and analysis 
they may not provide these services as required or in a timely manner 
if we fail to complete our phase trial of provenge  db or if we experience delays in completing that trial as currently planned  or we otherwise fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our other present or planned clinical trials  our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could materially suffer 
our development costs will increase if we experience any future delays in our clinical trials for provenge or other potential products or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than we currently plan 
if the delays or costs are significant  our financial results and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be adversely affected 
in april  the fda placed our da the predecessor to db study of provenge on partial clinical hold and required us to provide additional information regarding the identity and functionality of the product candidate 
we submitted additional information  and the fda lifted the partial hold in october during this period we were permitted to continue treating patients already enrolled in the trial  but could not enroll new patients in da 
if testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results  then we will be unable to commercialize that product 
our product candidates in clinical trials must meet rigorous testing standards 
we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our potential products in humans through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our potential products  including the following safety and efficacy results from human clinical trials  such as our provenge trials  may not be replicated in later clinical trials  the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  after reviewing relevant information  including preclinical testing or human clinical trial results  we or our collaborators may abandon or substantially restructure projects that we might previously have believed to be promising  including provenge  apc  trp p and our monoclonal antibody programs  we  our collaborators or regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons  and the effects of our potential products may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved 
clinical testing is very expensive  takes many years  and the outcome is uncertain 
d  our first phase clinical trial for provenge  did not meet its main objective of showing a statistically significant delay in the median time to disease progression in the overall patient population in the study 
although the analysis identified a group of patients who were benefited by treatment with provenge  we may not obtain favorable results from the clinical study of more patients in this group in our pivotal phase trial  db  or those results may cause the fda to require additional studies 
data from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of our potential products 
the clinical trials of provenge or our other product candidates may not continue or be completed as planned  and the fda may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale 
if we fail to demonstrate the safety or efficacy of a product candidate under development  this will delay or prevent regulatory approval of that product candidate  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
administering any of our product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects 
these side effects could interrupt  delay or cause us or the fda to halt clinical trials related to any of our product candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates for any or all target indications 
we  our collaborators or the fda may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time  which would adversely affect our business 
commercialization of our product candidates in the united states requires fda approval  which may not be granted  and foreign commercialization requires similar approvals 
the fda can delay  limit or withhold approval of a product candidates for many reasons  including the following a product candidate may not demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy  the fda may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials in different ways than we interpret the data or may require data that is different from what we obtained in our clinical trials  the fda may require additional information about the safety  purity  stability  identity or functionality of a product candidate  the fda may not approve our manufacturing processes or facilities  or the processes or facilities of our collaborators  and the fda may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations 
the fda also may approve a product for fewer indications than are requested or may condition approval on the performance of post marketing clinical studies 
even if we receive fda and other regulatory approvals  our products may later exhibit adverse effects that limit or prevent their widespread use or that force us to withdraw those products from the market 
any product and its manufacturer will continue to be subject to strict regulations after approval 
any unforeseen problems with an approved product or any violation of regulations could result in restrictions on the product  including its withdrawal from the market 
the process of obtaining approvals in foreign countries is subject to delay and failure for many of the same reasons 
a significant delay in or failure to receive approval for any of our products could materially harm our business and reduce our stock price 
the process of obtaining required fda and other regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  is expensive  often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
provenge and our other vaccine products are novel  therefore  regulatory agencies may lack experience with them  which may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of provenge and our other vaccine products under development 
to date  the fda has not approved for commercial sale in the united states any cancer vaccine designed to stimulate the body s immune system cells to kill cancer cells directly 
consequently  there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies in this area 
in addition  we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals for marketing and commercial sale  which may impede our ability to obtain fda approvals 
we will not be able to commercialize any of our potential products until we obtain fda approval 
therefore  any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  fda approval could harm our business 
we must comply with extensive regulation  which is costly  time consuming and may subject us to unanticipated delays 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates  those product candidates may still face regulatory difficulties 
our activities  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  cell processing and manufacturing  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable authorities outside the united states 
preclinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of a potential product 
the fda regulates preclinical studies under a series of regulations called the current good laboratory practices 
if we violate these regulations  the fda  in some cases  may invalidate the studies and require that we replicate those studies 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  must become effective before human clinical trials may commence 
the investigational new drug application is automatically effective days after receipt by the fda unless  before that time  the fda requests an extension to review the application  or raises concerns or questions about the design of the trials as described in the application 
in the latter case  any outstanding concerns must be resolved with the fda before clinical trials can proceed 
thus  the submission of an ind may not result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials in any given case 
after authorization is received  the fda retains authority to place the ind  and clinical trials under that ind  on clinical hold 
we  and third parties on whom we rely to assist us with clinical trials  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the design and conduct of clinical trials 
also  investigational products in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with a series of complex regulations called current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp 
other products used in connection with our clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with regulations called the quality systems regulations  or qsr 
these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of our investigational products 
we and third parties with whom we contract for manufacturing and cell processing must comply with cgmp or qsr  as applicable 
our facilities and quality systems and potentially the facilities and quality systems of our third party contractors must pass a pre approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of fda approval of provenge or any of our other potential products 
in addition  the fda may  at any time  audit our clinical trials or audit or inspect a manufacturing or cell processing facility involved with the production of provenge or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted 
if any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations  the fda may require remedial measures that may be costly and or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility 
the fda may also disqualify a clinical trial in whole or in part from consideration in support of approval of a potential product for commercial sale or otherwise deny approval of that product 
any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could harm our business 
if we are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage  including post marketing approval  we may be subject to criminal prosecution  fined  forced to remove a product from the market and or experience other adverse consequences  including delays  which could materially harm our financial results 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products 
we may also be required to undertake post marketing clinical trials 
if the results of such post marketing studies are not satisfactory  the fda may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us that may be expensive and or time consuming to fulfill 
in addition  if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products and additional marketing applications may be required 
our competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective  safer or reach the market sooner  which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize 
competition in the cancer therapeutics field is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets 
research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render provenge or our other potential products obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue 
there are products currently under development by others that could compete with provenge or other products that we are developing 
for example  avi biopharma  inc  cell genesys  inc 
and therion biologics are each developing prostate cancer vaccines that could potentially compete with provenge 
avi biopharma and therion are in phase clinical trials of their prostate cancer vaccines 
cell genesys has completed phase clinical trials of its prostate cancer vaccine and has announced plans to commence phase trials 
other products such as chemotherapeutics  antisense compounds  angiogenesis inhibitors and gene therapies for cancer are also under development by a number of companies and could potentially compete with provenge and our other product candidates 
some of our competitors in the cancer therapeutics field have substantially greater research and development capabilities and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
if our products receive marketing approval  but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our profitability and financial position will suffer 
market acceptance of our product candidates  if any  is uncertain 
even if our potential products are approved and sold  physicians may not ultimately use them or may use them only in applications more restricted than we expect 
physicians will only prescribe a product if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect profiles and other factors  that it is beneficial and preferable to other products then in use 
many other factors influence the adoption of new products  including marketing and distribution restrictions  course of treatment  adverse publicity  product pricing  the views of thought leaders in the medical community  and reimbursement by third party payors 
failure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our products and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding 
we depend  to a significant extent  on the efforts of our key employees  including senior management and senior scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel 
the development of new therapeutic products requires expertise from a number of different disciplines  some of which are not widely available 
we depend upon our scientific staff to discover new product candidates and to develop and conduct preclinical studies of those new potential products 
our clinical and regulatory staff is responsible for the design and execution of clinical trials in accordance with fda requirements and for the advancement of our product candidates toward fda approval 
the quality and reputation of our scientific  clinical and regulatory staff  especially the senior staff  and their success in performing their responsibilities  may directly influence the success of our product development programs 
in addition  our chief executive officer and other executive officers are involved in a broad range of critical activities  including providing strategic and operational guidance 
the loss of these individuals  or our inability to retain or recruit other key management and scientific  clinical  regulatory and other personnel  may delay or prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we face intense competition for personnel from other companies  universities  public and private research institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we must expand our operations to commercialize our products  which we may not be able to do 
we will need to expand and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete development of provenge  develop the necessary commercial infrastructure  and pursue development of our other product candidates 
we will need to add manufacturing  quality control  quality assurance  marketing and sales personnel  and personnel in all other areas of our operations and expand our capabilities  which may strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to compete effectively and manage growth in our personnel and capabilities  we must  among other things recruit  train  manage and motivate our employees  accurately forecast demand for our product candidates  and expand existing facilities  and operational  financial and management information systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our product development and commercialization efforts could be curtailed or delayed 
we have no commercial or other large scale manufacturing experience and may rely on third party manufacturers  which will limit our ability to control the availability of  and manufacturing costs for  our products 
to be successful  our products must be capable of being manufactured in sufficient quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
we have no commercial or other large scale manufacturing experience 
we may rely on third parties for certain aspects of the commercial and clinic trial manufacture of our products 
a limited number of contract manufacturers are capable of manufacturing the components of provenge 
if we cannot contract for large scale manufacturing capabilities that we require on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties with manufacturers and cannot manufacture the contracted components ourselves  we may not be able to conduct clinical trials as planned or to market and sell our products 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our product candidates on a commercial scale 
we have contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the scale up to commercial level production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
we cannot be certain that this contract will result in our ability to produce the antigen for provenge on a commercial scale  if provenge is approved for commercial sale 
we operate a facility for cell processing and the manufacture of antigens for our clinical trials 
we also contract with third parties to provide these services 
these facilities may not be sufficient to meet our needs for our provenge and other clinical trials 
to manufacture any of our potential products in commercial quantities ourselves  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train a significant number of employees  construct additional facilities and comply with applicable regulations for these facilities  which are extensive 
we may not be able to develop production facilities that both meet regulatory requirements and are sufficient for our clinical trials or for commercial use 
we are dependent on single source vendors for some of our components 
we currently depend on single source vendors for some of the components necessary for our vaccine candidates  including provenge 
there are  in general  relatively few alternative sources of supply for these components 
while these vendors have produced our vaccine components with acceptable quality  quantity and cost in the past  they may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components could take a substantial amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement vendors who meet regulatory requirements 
if we have to switch to a replacement vendor  the manufacture and delivery of our vaccines could be interrupted for an extended period  adversely affecting our business 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims  we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably 
we invent and develop technologies that are the basis for or incorporated in our potential products for which we seek to obtain patent protection 
our issued patents and applications relate to the antigens  serine proteases  compounds  and other biologic matter around which our product candidates are constructed  as well as the methods and processes for manufacturing those product candidates 
our patent applications are in various stages of processing 
we expect that we will continue to file and prosecute patent applications and that our success depends in part on our ability to establish and defend our proprietary rights in the technologies that are the subject of issued patents and patent applications 
the fact that we have filed a patent application  or that a patent has issued  does not ensure that we will have meaningful protection from competition with regard to the underlying technology or product 
others can challenge any patent application that we may file or the validity and or scope of any patent issued to us 
the patents themselves may relate to inventions that are reasonably easy to design around  and other companies may invent comparable or superior technologies that do not rely on any of our patented technologies 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry may not be as strong  or may be subject to greater risk of challenge  with more uncertainty as to the outcome of any such challenge  than would be the case in more established fields 
because patents are particularly important in the field of medical technology  other companies may have a greater incentive to challenge our patents or to assert that our technologies violate their proprietary rights than might otherwise be the case 
we are also subject to the risk of claims  whether meritorious or not  that our therapeutic vaccines or other potential products or processes use proprietary technology of others for which we do not have a valid license 
there are patents owned by third parties  and such a third party could assert a claim that our therapeutic vaccines infringe a patent owned by that party 
if a lawsuit making any such claims were brought against us  we would assert that the patent at issue is either invalid or not infringed 
however  we may not be able to establish non infringement  and we may not be able to establish invalidity through clear and convincing evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that issued patents are valid 
if we are found to infringe a valid patent  we could be required to seek a license or discontinue or delay commercialization of the affected products  and we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could materially harm our business 
litigation relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive  and our position as a relatively small company in an industry dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our property rights 
even if we are able to defend our positions  the cost of doing so may adversely affect our profitability 
we have not experienced significant patent litigation 
however  this may reflect in part the fact that we have not yet commercialized any products 
we may be subject to such litigation and may not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost  if such litigation is initiated 
we may collaborate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company in the commercialization  marketing and distribution of provenge in the united states  and may collaborate with other companies in the development and commercialization of our other potential products 
in some cases  we may develop a product candidate in collaboration with other companies in order to share the development risk  to gain access to complementary technologies or facilities or for other reasons 
the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology  which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge  could impede our ability to enter into such relationships on an advantageous basis or at all 
we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques and may obtain patents covering our unpatented technology or trade secrets 
others may gain access to or disclose our technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we may not be able to effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
although we require those who work with us to execute confidentiality agreements  these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information 
one of our capitalized leases is secured by all of our assets  including our intellectual property 
the amount of remaining lease payments due on this lease as of december  was approximately million 
the availability and amount of reimbursement for our potential products and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for our potential products is uncertain  we may face challenges from government or private payors that adversely affect reimbursement for our potential products 
we expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with our products  if those products are approved for marketing  will be eligible for medicare benefits 
other patients may be covered by private health plans or uninsured 
the application of existing medicare regulations and interpretive rulings to newly approved products  especially novel products such as ours  is not certain  and those regulations and interpretive rulings are subject to change 
if we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from medicare or from private health plans  our ability to sell our potential products will be adversely affected 
medicare regulations and interpretive rulings also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services 
this may adversely affect our ability to market or sell our potential products  if approved 
federal  state and foreign governments continue to propose legislation designed to contain or reduce health care costs 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our potential products may change or be adopted before any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our products under development unaffordable 
in addition  government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost effectiveness of therapeutic products 
accordingly  these third parties may ultimately not consider any or all of our products under development to be cost effective  which could result in products not being covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price 
any of these initiatives or developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our potential products 
we are exposed to potential product liability claims  and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of therapeutic products 
we have clinical trial insurance coverage  and we intend to obtain product liability insurance coverage in the future 
however  this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us or available to us at an acceptable cost  if at all 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers and loss of revenues 
thus  whether or not we are insured  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
we use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations  which can be expensive 
our research and development activities will continue to involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations relating to the use  handling  storage and disposal of these materials 
we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such substances  and store our low level radioactive waste at our facilities until the materials are no longer considered radioactive 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we may be required to incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety regulations 
in the event of an accident or contamination  we would likely incur significant costs associated with civil penalties or criminal fines  lawsuits from regulatory authorities and private parties  and in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
if we do not progress in our programs as anticipated  our stock price could decrease 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical  regulatory and other milestones  such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development  when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed 
some of our estimates are included in this report 
we base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions 
many of the underlying assumptions are outside of our control 
if milestones are not achieved when we expect them to be  investors could be disappointed  and our stock price may fall 
we may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome 
our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees  licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships  or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours 
if we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties  we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us 
that litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management s time and attention  at the expense of other aspects of our business 
the outcome of litigation is always uncertain  and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages  enjoin us from certain activities or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
market volatility may affect our stock price  and the value of your investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
the trading price for our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  volatile 
the price at which our common stock trades depends on number of factors  including the following  many of which are beyond our control our historical and anticipated operating results  including fluctuations in our financial and operating results  preclinical and clinical trial results  market perception of the prospects for biotechnology companies as an industry sector  general market and economic conditions  changes in government regulations affecting product approvals  reimbursement or other aspects of our or our competitors businesses  fda review of our product development activities  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  developments concerning our key personnel and intellectual property rights  announcements regarding significant collaborations or strategic alliances  and publicity regarding actual or potential performance of products under development by us or our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock 
the high and low intraday prices per share of our common stock on the nasdaq national market were and respectively in  and respectively in  and and respectively in this year through march  the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was  shares in   shares in  and  shares this year through march  during periods of stock market price volatility  share prices of many biotechnology companies have often fluctuated in a manner not necessarily related to their individual operating performance 
accordingly  our common stock may be subject to greater price volatility than the stock market as a whole 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  shares have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock  and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could reduce the voting power of the holders of our common stock and the likelihood that common stockholders will receive payments upon liquidation 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
this may delay any attempt to replace our board of directors 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquirer from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
if registration rights that we have previously granted are exercised  then our stock price may be negatively affected 
we have granted registration rights in connection with the issuance of our securities to a number of our stockholders and warrant holders 
in the aggregate  as of december   these registration rights covered approximately  shares of our common stock which were then outstanding and an additional  shares of our common stock which may become outstanding upon the exercise of warrants that were then outstanding 
if these registration rights  or similar registration rights that may apply to securities we may issue in the future  are exercised by the holders  it could result in additional sales of our common stock in the market  which may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we currently have in effect a registration statement relating to  shares pursuant to which artisan equity  ltd 
may freely resell these shares into the public market at any time or from time to time 
our issuance of shares pursuant to existing or future collaborations or other agreements or under our shelf registration statement will dilute the equity ownership of our existing stockholders 
under our equity line financing agreement with bny capital markets  inc  or cmi  we may  at our option and subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions  issue to cmi an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time through june  the precise number of shares of our common stock that we may issue to cmi over the remaining term of the equity line financing agreement will depend primarily on the number of drawdowns we choose to make  the amounts of those drawdowns and the closing market price of our common stock during the drawdown periods 
also  from time to time during drawdown periods  within limitations specified in our equity line facility with cmi and subject to applicable laws  cmi may engage in hedging and other transactions in our common stock and may sell and deliver shares of our common stock issued under the equity line facility in connection with these transactions 
if cmi engages in such transactions  the price of our common stock may fall 
under our agreement with genentech  if a specified milestone relating to trp p is achieved  genentech is obligated to purchase from us million of our common stock at a price based on the average closing price of our stock over the prior trading days 
an agreement between abgenix  inc and corvas provides that in the event the parties elect to expand the research program covered by that agreement  abgenix would be obligated to purchase million of corvas common stock 
in our acquisition of corvas  our subsidiary  dendreon san diego llc  succeeded to the rights and obligations of corvas under this agreement 
in the event that the parties elect to expand the research program  we anticipate that the equity investment by abgenix would be made in exchange for shares of dendreon common stock 
we currently propose to enter into certain other agreements involving our issuance of additional shares of common stock 
further  we are currently in discussions with potential collaborators with respect to provenge 
in connection with any such provenge collaboration or any other collaboration that we may enter into in the future  we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities  and the value of the securities issued may be substantial 
we may sell up to million of our common stock under our outstanding shelf registration statement 
future sales under our shelf registration statement will depend primarily on the market price of our common stock  the interest in our company by institutional investors and our cash needs 
in addition  we may register additional shares with the sec for sale in the future 
each of our issuances of common stock to cmi under the equity line facility and to other investors under our registration statements or otherwise will proportionately decrease our existing stockholders percentage ownership of our total outstanding equity interests and may reduce our stock price 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
furthermore  we may become subject to contractual restrictions or prohibitions on the payment of dividends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short and long term investments  assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our lease line by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
