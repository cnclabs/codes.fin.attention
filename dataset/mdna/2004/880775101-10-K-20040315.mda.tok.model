item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we develop  market and sell cable modem termination systems cmts  customer premise equipment cpe products  including cable modems  and digital video equipment 
our revenues are generated principally from sales of these three major product groups either directly to broadband service providers through direct sales forces primarily in north america  europe and asia and through resellers 
over the last year  we completed the transition from selling proprietary based products to selling standards based products using the data over cable system interface specification docsis specification 
we now generate docsis cmts and cable modem sales to us cable operators as well as to our legacy global customers 
over the last year  we completed the transition from selling proprietary based products to selling standards based products using the data over cable system interface specification docsis specification 
due primarily to the adoption of docsis and our current position as the only vendor with qualified docsis cmts  we now generate docsis cmts and cable modem sales to us cable operators as well as to global customers 
our gross margins fluctuate from period to period primarily as a result of the mix of products we sell 
specifically  we derive substantially higher margins from sales of our cmts and digital video equipment products than we do from sales of our cpe products  which are subject to intense price competition 
to date a majority of our total revenues are generated by sales of our cpe products 
we also believe that the widespread adoption of industry specifications  such as the docsis specifications  will further erode asps 
we anticipate that the erosion of asps of our cpes will continue  and price erosion will accelerate in the first half of we are working to mitigate pressures on our gross margins by continuing to focus on product manufacturing cost reductions  especially for our cpe products  by transitioning to a new original design manufacturer odm in asia during the first half of to the extent that the containment of our product costs do not keep pace with asp declines  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
we have not been profitable since our inception 
we had a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december   and a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  we are targeting profitability to begin in the second quarter of  and we believe our ability to achieve profitability in the long term will depend primarily on three factors 
the first factor is our ability to achieve improved gross margins through an improved sales mix by increasing sales of higher margin digital video and cmts products relating to expected cpe product growth 
to increase sales of digital video products  we are targeting new markets such as the broadcast sector and promoting new applications such as high definition television hdtv and digital insertion to cable satellite operators 
to grow the cmts business  we will attempt to capitalize on our docsis expertise and provide application solutions for docsis advanced services  including voice over internet protocol voip and commercial services 
to the extent that sales of cpe products continue to comprise a greater proportion of our total revenues  our ability to achieve profitability could be adversely affected 
secondly  we will continue to focus on lowering product costs for modems through our new odm relationship in asia and the introduction of our new lower cost semiconductor  which is used in cable modems 
in our cmts business  we will continue to reduce costs through improved designs  better leveraging of our contract manufacture supply network  and the reduction of sole source components 
finally  as discussed below  we expect to benefit from a lower expense base resulting in part from a restructuring in the first quarter of combined with continued focus on cost containment 
however  despite these efforts  we may not succeed in attaining profitability in the near future  if at all 
when the downturn in the communications industry became evident in fiscal  we began to implement restructuring plans to reduce operating expenses and capital spending and to narrow the focus of 
table of contents our business 
as it became evident in fiscal that our industry was experiencing an even more pronounced and prolonged economic downturn  we took additional measures to align our cost structure 
our most recent restructuring occurred in the first quarter of whereby  we initiated a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees  or of the workforce  consolidated certain facilities  and reduced or eliminated certain discretionary costs and programs 
we expect to record total charges in the range of approximately million to million associated with this realignment in the quarter ending march  beginning in the second quarter of  we anticipate annual savings to be approximately million to million 
furthermore  as part of our restructuring efforts to refocus our business  we sold or discontinued certain lines of products 
we may continue to divest unprofitable product lines in an effort to focus on growing our business profitably and redirect our resources 
however  despite these restructuring actions  we may not be able to meet expected revenue levels in any particular period or attain profitability in any future period 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to approximately million at december  the significant decrease in the amount of cash and cash equivalents in as compared to primarily resulted from significant uses of cash for operating activities in although we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months  we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our ability to grow our business and attain profitability is dependent on our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace with our current products and services  develop and introduce new products and services  contain operating expenses and improve our gross margins  as well as the continued recovery of the communications industry 
a more detailed description of the risks to our business can be found in the section captioned risk factors in this annual report 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues we sell our products directly to broadband service providers  and to a lesser extent resellers 
revenues related to product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision is made for estimated product returns as product shipments are made 
our existing agreements typically do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the warranty 
revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized when product is shipped to the resellers as we generally do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the warranty 
revenues consist primarily of sales of products to new and existing customers providing broadband services 
prior to december   we operated primarily in two principal operating segments cable broadband access systems cable and telecom carrier access systems telecom 
beginning in  the telecom segment no longer met the quantitative threshold for disclosure and we operated as one business segment 

table of contents our revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  primarily due to increased sales of docsis cmts and cpe products  particularly in the second half of  partially offset by declining sales of our proprietary s cdma cmts and cpe products and telecom products 
revenues by groups of similar products for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues by product cmts products cpe products video products other products total cmts product revenues increased in compared to  due to increased deployment of our docsis products into new markets  primarily in the us we expect cmts revenues to continue to increase in as we continue to expand sales into the us  asia and europe 
cpe product revenues decreased in compared to  due to a continuing decline in asps  partially offset by increases in the volume of modem sales 
the number of docsis modems sold increased from million units in to million units in the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband products resulted in significant price erosion 
we anticipate that modem unit price erosion will continue in the first half of however  we believe that our full transition to an odm in asia during the first half of and the introduction of our new lower cost modem semiconductor may allow us to remain competitive in the marketplace and maintain favorable margins on these products 
cpe revenues also decreased due to the shift in product mix from our higher priced proprietary s cdma modems to our lower priced docsis modems 
the number of s cdma modems sold decreased from million units in to million units in revenues from video products decreased in compared to  due to decreased sales to us multiple system operators msos 
we attribute this decline to lower capital spending by msos  primarily in the first half of however  we have seen growth in sales of our network cherrypicker  especially in the second half of  and we believe that we will continue to see increased sales of video products as demand for high definition television hdtv and other video services grows in other product revenues decreased in compared to  due to decreased sales of our legacy telecom products 
we expect sales of telecom products to be minimal in 
table of contents revenues by geographic region for the year ended december  annual change in thousands revenues by geographic areas united states canada europe israel japan asia  excluding japan south america total revenues in the united states increased to million in  up from million in  due to increased sales of docsis cmtss  modems and video products to us msos 
during  we emphasized sales to our us  european  japanese and other asian customers while placing a lower emphasis on other locations such as canada  israel and south america 
in  we expect revenues to increase in the united states  asian and european markets 
three customers  adelphia communications corporation adelphia  j com cross beam networks  a subsidiary of sumitomo  and comcast each accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december    
one customer  cross beam networks accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december  
related party revenues for the year ended december  annual change in thousands related party revenues rogers revenues harmonic revenues total related party revenues related party revenues decreased in compared to related party revenues in included revenues from rogers communications  inc rogers and harmonic  inc harmonic 
alek krstajic  a member of our board of directors  was the senior vice president of interactive services  sales and product development for rogers until january effective in april  rogers was no longer a related party to us 
consequently  revenues attributable to rogers are only classified as related party revenues in the first quarter of lewis solomon  another member of our board of directors  is a member of the board of directors of harmonic 
all revenues attributable to harmonic were included in related party revenues in and the decline in related party revenues was primarily due to the classification of revenues attributable to rogers as general revenues instead of related party revenues after the first quarter of  as well as lower overall sales to rogers  offset by an increase of sales to harmonic in none of our related parties is a supplier to us 
in december  we entered into co marketing arrangements with shaw communications  inc shaw and rogers 
we paid million to shaw and million to rogers  and recorded these amounts as other current assets 
in july  we began amortizing these prepaid assets and charging them against related party revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration 
table of contents given by a vendor to a customer or reseller in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
we charged million per quarter of the amortization of these assets against total revenues through december  amounts charged against total revenues in the year ended december  and december   totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
of the co marketing amortization charged to total revenues  million and million were charged to related party revenue in the year ended and  respectively 
no further amounts of these co marketing arrangements are included in other current assets at december  and no further amortization will occur in cost of goods sold and gross profit for the year ended december  annual change in thousands cost of product revenues cost of related party revenues total cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing operations 
the cost of manufacturing includes contract manufacturing  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in  cost of goods sold was approximately of revenues compared to of revenues in cost of goods sold in and included the benefit of reversals of approximately million and million  respectively  in special charges taken in and for vendor cancellation charges and inventory previously reserved for as excess and obsolete 
we reversed these provisions as we were able to sell inventory originally considered to be in excess and obsolete 
in addition  we were able to negotiate downward certain vendor cancellation claims to terms more favorable to us 
additionally  during and  we recorded inventory charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce some of our inventory due to excess and obsolescence and to reduce the inventory to the lower of cost or market value in as asps fell below the cost of these products and to record charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in  related party cost of revenues decreased compared to due to increased sales of our higher margin video products to harmonic in as well as fewer sales of our lower margin cpe products to rogers classified as related party revenue in compared to additionally  in the first quarter of  we sold million of software to rogers  which was classified as related party revenues  with no cost of related party revenues associated with this sale 
our gross profit increased to million or of sales in the year ended december  compared to million  or of sales  in the increase in our gross profit was primarily related to an improved sales mix  with higher margin video and cmts products constituting a higher proportion of sales particularly in the second half of  and improved product manufacturing costs for modems 
during  we anticipate further decreases in our asps and continued pressure on our cpe margins 
consequently  we continue to focus on improving sales of higher margin products and reducing product manufacturing costs 
we are now partnering with contract manufacturers in asia and the us for our cmts  cpe  and video products  which may provide us with more competitive component pricing  economies of scale  and improved manufacturing capabilities 
in addition  we are currently evaluating possible outsourcing partnerships for certain of our supply chain functions  with the objective of increasing our focus on our core competencies  reducing our costs  and leveraging our target partners capabilities 
as we endeavor to shift our product mix from cpe revenues to higher margin cmts and digital video product revenues  we expect our margins to increase

the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of  and found no impairment 
due to a difficult economic environment and heightened price competition in the modem and telecom businesses during the three months ended june   we experienced a significant drop in our market capitalization  and therefore proceeded to perform an interim test to measure goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at june  based on our forecast  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the goodwill would be less than its carrying amount

defendants removed the bertram case to the united states district court  central district of california  which dismissed the complaint and transferred the case to the united states district court  northern district of california 
that court eventually issued an order dismissing the case 
plaintiffs have appealed this order  and their appeal has been set for oral argument on april  we believe that the allegations in both the class action and the bertramcase are without merit  and we intend to contest these matters vigorously 
these matters  however  could prove costly and time consuming to defend  and there can be no assurances about the eventual outcome 
on january   omniband group limited  a russian company  or omniband  filed a request for arbitration with the zurich chamber of commerce  claiming damages in an amount of  allegedly caused by our breach of an agreement to sell to omniband certain equipment pursuant to an agreement between omniband and radwiz  ltd  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
on december   the 
table of contents panel of arbiters with the zurich chamber of commerce allowed the arbitration proceeding to continue against radwiz 
we believe that the allegations are without merit and intend to present a vigorous defense in the arbitration proceedings 
we  as well as our customers  have received letters from third parties claiming that our technology and products infringe on the third parties patents 
we have consulted with our patent counsel and are in the process of reviewing the allegations made by such third parties 
we do not know whether the third parties will pursue their claims of patent infringement in court  and if they do  whether we will be found to infringe the third parties patents 
if we are found to have infringed such third party patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from selling our products and conducting our business 
additionally  additional third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claim of patent infringement  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings  in addition to those noted above  and may become involved from time to time in other legal proceedings in the future 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these other proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any of our legal proceedings  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs 
the estimate of the potential impact on our financial position and overall results of operations for any of the above legal proceedings could change in the future 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than lease commitments and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities  guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in transferred assets or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million used in in  significant uses of cash from operating activities included million loss from operations  million increase in accounts receivable  million of settlement and payment of vendor cancellation liabilities  and million of increase in gross inventory 
accounts receivable increased as our sales in the fourth quarter of increased when compared to the same period in inventory levels increased at december  when compared to december  due to increased modem inventories in the fourth quarter of in order to meet service levels established with our key customers 
in  significant uses of cash from operating activities included million loss from operations  million of gain on the repurchase of a portion of the notes  and million decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million in we did not repurchase any notes in cash used in investing activities in was million compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment in and cash used in investing activities increased in due to our usage of investments to fund operations and movement from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments in 
table of contents cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million of cash used in financing activities in in we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million 
in  we paid approximately million to repurchase a portion of the notes 
in  we received a total of million from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
in july  we issued million of notes  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are our general unsecured obligation and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time on or after october  through maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased 
interest is payable semi annually 
debt issuance costs related to the notes were approximately million 
through december   we had repurchased approximately million of the notes for million in cash and million in stock  resulting in a gain on early retirement of debt of approximately million net of related unamortized issuance costs of million 
no notes were repurchased in we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
as noted above  we are working to achieve profitability by the second quarter of to do so  we will need to increase revenues  primarily through sales of more profitable products  and decrease costs 
in the first quarter of  we initiated a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees  or of the workforce  consolidation of certain facilities  and reduction or elimination of discretionary costs and programs 
we expect to record total charges in the range of approximately million to million associated with this realignment in the quarter ending march  beginning in the second quarter of  we anticipate annual savings to be approximately to million 
these statements are forward looking in nature and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under the risk factor our operating results may fluctuate below and elsewhere 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
we may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  and financing under leasing arrangements or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
on october   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on november   will allow us to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock from time to time up to an aggregate of million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
on november   we filed a prospectus supplement with reference to our intention to offer  shares of common stock  which would result in gross proceeds of million 
on november   we withdrew our previously announced public offering of  shares of common stock under the shelf registration statement

the obligations require us to purchase minimum quantities of the suppliers products at a specified price 
as of december   we had approximately million of purchase obligations  of which million is included in the consolidated balance sheets as accrued vendor cancellation charges  and the remaining is attributable to open purchase orders

we discuss each of our critical accounting policies  in addition to certain less significant accounting policies  with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which 
table of contents form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts revenue  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs  which impact cost of good sold and gross margins  and the valuation of certain long lived assets  especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  which has resulted in impairment  which impacts operating expenses 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices  which may not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b and updated by sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of the selling price 
should there be changes to management s judgments  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue arrangements with resellers are generally recognized when product is shipped to the resellers as we generally do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the warranty 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 
we evaluate our trade receivables based upon a combination of factors 
credit losses have historically been within management s expectations 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we maintain a reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on an assessment of collectibility 
we assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past history  the number of days an amount is past due based on invoice due date  changes in credit ratings of customers  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our client s customers and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further reduced 
charges for uncollectible accounts are included as a component of net revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december  and  the reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts was million and million  respectively 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant percentage of our revenues and accounts receivable 
we expect the sale of our products to a limited number of customers and resellers to continue to account for a high percentage of revenues 
inventory valuation 
we record losses on commitments to purchase inventory in accordance with statement of chapter of accounting release bulletin no 
our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  generally six months or less as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
given the rapid technological change in the 
table of contents technology and communications equipment industries as well as significant  unpredictable changes in capital spending by our customers  we believe that assessing the value of inventory using generally a six month time horizon is appropriate 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for the revenue forecast  which is also consistent with our short term manufacturing plan 
based on this analysis  we reduce the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets have principally included long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair value of the long term investments was dependent on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
if the companies business forecasts were not met  we had to record additional impairment charges 
at december   all of our intangible assets had been written off and we had no intangible assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
on january  we reclassified million of assembled workforce  net of accumulated amortization  with an indefinite life  to goodwill at the date of adoption of this standard 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of  and found no impairment 
during the first and second quarters of  we completed a restructuring and impairment review as further discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
due to a difficult economic environment and heightened price competition in the modem and telecom businesses during the second quarter of  we experienced a significant drop in our market capitalization and therefore proceeded to perform an interim test to measure goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
the outcome of this test resulted in a non cash charge of million to write off goodwill in both the cable and telecom segments during the second quarter of at december  and  we had no goodwill or intangible assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
warranty reserves 
we provide a standard warranty for most of our products  generally lasting one to five years from the date of purchase 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision to the warranty liability would be required  resulting in decreased gross profits 
restructuring and other related charges 
during   and  we implemented restructuring programs to focus and streamline our business and reduce operating expenses 
in connection with these programs  we reduced headcount and abandoned facilities 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges primarily consisting of cash severance payments made to severed employees and lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation 
each reporting period  we review these estimates based on the execution of our restructuring plans and changing market conditions  such as the real estate market 
to the extent that these assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  acquisitions and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  any of which may result in higher net loss 

table of contents taxes 
we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require profitability 
we have assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits  and have concluded that the deferred tax assets will be not be currently realized and have recorded a valuation allowance against the entire amount of the deferred tax assets 
should our operating performance improve  future assessments could conclude that a reduction to the valuation allowance will be needed to reflect deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we began shipping products commercially in june  and we have been shipping products in volume since the first quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that we will continue to experience challenges in selling our products at a profit and may continue to operate with net losses for the foreseeable future 
moreover  from to  we have had declining revenue year over year 
although our revenues increased in as compared to  we still incurred losses of million in as a result of the operating deficiencies  we have had to use available cash and cash equivalents to supplement the operation of our 
table of contents business 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments used in the twelve months ended december  was million as compared to million used in the same period in at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to approximately million at december  additionally  we generally are unable to significantly reduce our short term expenses in order to compensate for unexpected decreases in anticipated revenues or delays in generating anticipated revenues 
for example  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price irrespective of whether we can subsequently use such quantities in our products 
further  we have been experiencing and will continue to experience declining average selling prices asps of our products 
we record an inventory charge to reduce our inventory to the lower of cost or market if average selling prices fall below the cost of these products 
in addition  we have significant operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment that generally cannot be cancelled in the short term without substantial penalties 
our business may be adversely affected by delays in  or our failure to  commercialize new products  or reduce the cost of manufacturing our current products 
moreover  given the conditions in the broadband equipment market  the profit potential of our business remains unproven 
we may experience fluctuations in our operating results and face unpredictability in our future revenues 
our quarterly revenues have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that affect our revenues include  among others  the following variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  variations in the size of the orders by our customers and pricing concessions on volume sales  competitive market conditions  unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by competitors or by us  delays in our introduction of new products  delays in our introduction of added features to our products  delays in the commercialization of products that are competitive in the marketplace  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  variations in capital spending budgets of cable operators and other broadband service providers  international conflicts  including the continuing conflict in iraq  and acts of terrorism and the impact of adverse economic  market and political conditions worldwide  and ability of our products to be qualified or certified as meeting industry standards 
a variety of factors affecting our gross margin include  among others  the following the sales mix of our products  the volume of products manufactured  the type of distribution channel through which we sell our products  the asps of our products  the ability to manage excess an obsolete inventory  delays in reducing the cost of our products  
table of contents the costs of manufacturing our products  and the effectiveness of our cost reduction measures 
we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed  particularly in the short term 
for example  a significant percentage of these operating expenses are fixed due to operating leases for our facilities and equipment 
also  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price 
because in the past  we have been unable to use all of the products that we purchased from our suppliers  we have taken vendor cancellation charges as a result of these fixed commitments  and we may have to take additional charges in the future if we are unable to use all of the products that we purchase from our suppliers 
recently  we have begun to negotiate clauses with vendors to push out or reschedule inventory purchases at our discretion 
these clauses should help to minimize the impact of vendor cancellation charges in the future 
as of december   million of purchase obligations were outstanding 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations  our operating results may be adversely impacted by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
moreover  our research and development expenses fluctuate in response to new product development  and changing industry requirements and customer demands 
additionally  the unit asps of our products declined considerably in and  and we anticipate that unit asps of our products may continue to decline in the future 
this has caused and will continue to cause a decrease in our gross margins if we are unable to off set the decline in asps with cost reduction measures 
in addition  the gross margins we realize from the sale of our products are affected by the mix of product sales between higher margin  lower volume head end equipment  such as cable modem termination systems cmtss and digital video management systems  and lower margin  higher volume customer premise equipment cpe products  such as modems 
in  we expect that sales of our low margin cpe will continue to make up a significant portion of our revenues 
we are dependent on a small number of customers and our business could be harmed by the loss of any of these customers or reductions in their purchasing volumes 
our customers have undergone and continue to undergo significant consolidation in both north america and internationally  as a limited number of cable operators control an increasing number of systems 
for example  the top nine cable operators in the united states operate systems that service approximately of homes that receive cable services in the united states 
as a result of the consolidation among cable operators  our revenue has been and will continue to be dependent on sales to the few leading cable operators worldwide and the continued consolidation may also reduce the number of potential customers 
for example  three customers  adelphia  cross beam networks  a subsidiary of sumitomo  and comcast each accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december    and 
one customer  related to the cable segment  cross beam networks  accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december  
two customers  shaw and cross beam networks  both related to the cable segment  accounted for or more of the total revenues for the year ended december  and 
two customers accounted for or more of total accounts receivable for the year ended december  and 
one customer  related to the cable segment  accounted for or more of total accounts receivable for the year ended december  
as is common in our industry  we typically do not enter into contracts with our customers in which they commit to purchase products from us 
typically  our customers purchase products from us on a purchase order basis 
we may not succeed in attracting new customers as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors and the continued consolidation of the cable industry reduces the number of potential customers 
to attract new customers  we may be faced with intense price 
table of contents competition  which may affect our gross margins 
our sales are made on a purchase order or system contract basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
moreover  we do not typically require our customers to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  and our customers can generally cancel their orders on short notice without significant penalties 
the loss of any of our customers can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  any reduction in orders from a given customer can likewise have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
the sales cycle for certain of our products is lengthy  which makes forecasting of our customer orders and revenue difficult 
the sales cycle for certain of our products  such as our cmtss  is lengthy  often lasting nine months to more than a year 
our customers generally conduct significant technical evaluations  including customer trials  of our products as well as competing products prior to making a purchasing decision 
in addition  purchasing decisions may also be delayed because of a customer s internal budget approval processes 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular period do not occur in that period  our revenues and operating results for that particular quarter could suffer 
moreover  a portion of our expenses related to an anticipated order is fixed and difficult to reduce or change  which may further impact our revenues and operating results for a particular period 
there are many risks associated with our participation in industry standards 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cable television laboratories  inc  a cable industry consortium that establishes cable technology standards and administers compliance testing cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs whereby we licensed to cablelabs on a royalty free basis any of our intellectual property rights  including rights to our proprietary s cdma technology  to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
as a result of this license to cablelabs  our competitors that produce docsis based products have access to our technology without having to pay us any royalties or other compensation for the use of our technology 
as a result of our contribution of technology to the docsis intellectual property pool  we may have foregone significant revenue from the potential licensing of our proprietary technology  and we may be unable to recoup the investment in the research and development of intellectual property contributed to the docsis technology pool 
additionally  the agreement that we signed with cablelabs to participate in the docsis intellectual property pool may make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights against other companies 
certain cable equipment vendors manufacture and sell docsis based and docsis certified and qualified products without sublicensing from cablelabs the technology in the cablelabs intellectual property pool 
due to the interests of cable operators in having as many equipment vendors as possible  we may feel constrained by competitive pressures from pursuing the enforcement of our intellectual property rights against our competitors that have not entered into sublicenses with cablelabs 
moreover  if we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against other equipment manufacturers that access technology from the cablelabs intellectual property pool  our license to the technology in the pool may be jeopardized 
certain contributors of technology to the cablelabs intellectual property pool are our competitors and may elect to revoke our license to their technology if we attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights against them 
we may have lost any competitive advantage that our proprietary s cdma technology may have provided us in the marketplace by licensing it to cablelabs  and we may face increased competition because our competitors have the ability to incorporate our technology into their products 
we believe that this increased competition could come from existing competitors or from new competitors who enter the market and that such competition is likely to result in lower product asps  which could harm our revenues and gross margins 
additionally  because our competitors will be able to incorporate our technology into their products  our current customers may choose alternate suppliers or choose to purchase docsis compliant products 
table of contents from multiple suppliers 
we may be unable to effectively compete with the other vendors if we cannot produce docsis compliant cable products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
docsis specifications have not yet been accepted in europe and asia  although an increasing number of asian cable operators are requiring product to be docsis qualified or certified 
an alternate specification for cable products  called the euro docsis specification  has been formalized by tcomlabs  a cable technology consortium of european cable operators  and some european and asian cable operators have embraced it 
we have contributed certain of our technologies  including our proprietary s cdma technology  to the euro docsis specification 
we may develop and sell products that comply with the euro docsis specification  and we may be unsuccessful in these efforts 
even if we are successful in our efforts  we may face some of the same risks associated with our contribution of intellectual property to the cablelabs docsis intellectual property pool 
we need to certify and qualify our new and existing products to meet industry specifications in order to remain competitive 
major cable operators worldwide have endorsed the docsis  euro docsis and packetcable specifications and rarely purchase equipment that is not certified or qualified as compliant with these specifications 
cable operators have chosen to purchase only products meeting industry specifications because the specifications enable interoperability among products from multiple vendors  which leads to increased competition among equipment manufacturers and consequently lowers product asps 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in this marketplace by developing  marketing and selling products that are certified and qualified to industry standards in a timely fashion and in a cost effective manner 
the docsis and packetcable specifications are promulgated by cablelabs 
currently these specifications have been widely adopted by cable operators in north america and by some cable operators in asia  latin america and europe 
the euro docsis specifications have been developed by tcomlabs specifically to meet the requirements of european operators  and have found some acceptance in china as well 
there is no guarantee that our products will be docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable certified or qualified 
if we are unable to certify or qualify our products as docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable compliant in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell our products and may lose some or all of any advantage we might otherwise have had  and our future operating results may be adversely affected 
although we sell certified and qualified products  there have been and may continue to be instances where our existing customers and potential new customers elect to purchase products from one or more of our competitors rather than from us 
in response to this situation  we have reduced our prices and continue to experience customer demand to further reduce our prices in order to promote sales of our current products 
this has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and gross margin 
developing products to meet these various industry specifications has several risks 
the first is the cost and effort to engineer standards based products and to then prepare them for compliance testing 
not only do we have to certify or qualify new products  but any of our currently certified or qualified products must be re certified or re qualified should they be changed in any way 
second  there is no guarantee that these products will be certified or qualified as meeting these specifications in a timely fashion  if ever 
because most cable operators purchase only those products that have been certified or qualified as meeting these specifications  it is highly unlikely that we will be able to sell our products until they achieve certification or qualification  which can be a lengthy process 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products that may not receive certification or qualification and we cannot recoup the costs of these research and development expenses by marketing uncertified or unqualified products 
moreover  a consequence of cable operators only purchasing products certified or qualified as meeting industry specifications is the increased competition between equipment vendors  which has resulted in a steady and ongoing decline in equipment prices as vendors compete for cable operators business 
third  there is no guarantee that we will be able to support all future cable industry specifications  which will likely have an adverse impact on our future revenues 

table of contents average selling prices of broadband equipment continue to decline  which is decreasing our gross margins 
the broadband equipment market has been characterized by erosion of product asps  particularly for cpe devices 
we expect this erosion to continue 
the asps for our products are likely to continue to decline due to competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers possessing strong negotiating positions who require price reductions as a condition of purchase 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry specifications  such as the docsis and eurodocsis specifications  is further eroding asps as cable modems and other similar cpe become commodity products 
decreasing asps could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units sold increases 
decreasing asps may also require us to sell our products at much lower gross margin than in the past  and in fact  we may sell products at a loss 
the primary reason that our gross profits have declined year over year is the decline in product asps 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future revenue  gross margin and operating results due to asp erosion 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis and a cost effective manner new products or next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline further 
we must achieve cost reductions to attain profitability 
as product asps and revenue have declined in recent years  we have not sufficiently decreased our costs  including operating expenses and the costs associated with our products  to offset declining asps and revenue 
this has resulted in increased losses and made it difficult for us to attain profitability 
we have experienced a decrease in revenue  which was  in large part  due to declining product asps and a drop in cmts volume due to our transition from a proprietary platform to the docsis standards platform 
in order to achieve profitability  we must significantly increase our revenues  reduce the cost of our products  and maintain or reduce our operating expenses 
we have undertaken several actions to lower our operating expenses 
although we have implemented expense reduction and restructuring plans in the past  including the latest restructuring in january  that have focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  our operating expenses are still higher than our gross margins 
a large portion of our expenses  including rent  and operating lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as product asps rapidly decline  we need to reduce the cost of our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products  and  even if we are successful  our efforts may be delayed or our redesigned products may contain significant errors and product defects 
in addition  any redesign may not result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce significantly the prices of our products or improve our gross margin 
reductions in our product costs may require us to use lower priced components that are highly integrated in future products and may require us to enter into high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreements 
volume purchase or manufacturing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and we could incur significant expenses without related revenues if we cannot use the products or services offered by such agreements 
we have incurred significant cancellation charges related to volume purchase and manufacturing agreements in the past and may incur such charges in the future 
broadband services delivered by cable operators have not achieved widespread market acceptance  and other competing service providers exist 
our success will depend upon the widespread acceptance of broadband services delivered by cable television operators 
the markets for these services are growing  but are not fully developed nor exploited 
additionally  these markets may not grow as cable operators may elect not to increase available bandwidth over which they can offer new services  such as high speed internet access  high definition television hdtv  video on demand  and telephony 
cable operators may elect not to provide any or all of these new 
table of contents services to their customers or may not aggressively market these services to their customers 
if cable operators elect not to deploy such new services or if customers elect not to subscribe to such services  it may affect our ability to sell products to cable operators as their existing equipment may meet their current infrastructure demands 
we depend on cable operators to provide new services and maintain their infrastructure in such a manner that allows us to continue to sell products to them 
cable operators must also compete with other service providers in the delivery of services to their customers 
rbocs  clecs  ilecs  satellite tv and other broadband service providers are aggressively competing with the cable industry to deliver broadband services via dsl or satellite broadcast technologies 
we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the ultimate size of the market for broadband services delivered via cable 
the success of rbocs  clecs  ilecs  satellite tv and other broadband service providers may slow or hamper the continued acceptance of cable operators in delivering broadband services  which in turn may impact demand for our products by cable operators 
we need to develop additional distribution channels to market and sell our products 
the vast majority of our sales are to large cable operators 
however  we currently have limited access to smaller or geographically diverse cable operators 
although we intend to establish strategic relationships with leading distributors worldwide to access these customers  we may not succeed in establishing these relationships 
even if we do establish these relationships  the distributors may not succeed in marketing our products to their customers 
some of our competitors have established  long standing relationships with these cable operators that may limit our and our distributors ability to sell our products to those customers 
even if we were to sell our products to those customers  it would likely not be based on long term commitments  and those customers would be able to terminate their relationships with us at any time without significant penalties 
we depend on cable industry capital spending for a substantial portion of our revenue and any decrease or delay in capital spending by cable operators would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
historically  almost all of our sales had been derived from sales to cable operators  and we expect these sales to constitute a significant portion of net sales for the foreseeable future 
demand for our products will depend on the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators 
these capital spending patterns are dependent on a variety of factors including the availability of financing  annual budget cycles  as well as the typical reduction in upgrade projects during the winter months  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry  overall demand for broadband services and the acceptance of new data  video and voice services  evolving industry standards and network architectures  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative data transmission and access technologies  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in recent years  the cable market has been characterized by consolidation 
for example  comcast acquired at t broadband in furthermore  cable operators may undertake additional business combinations to expand their business as evidenced by the recent unsolicited stock offering by comcast of the disney corporation 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that such consolidations and business combinations will have on overall capital spending patterns by cable operators 
the effect on our business of further industry consolidations and combinations also is uncertain 

table of contents the timing of deployment of our equipment can be subject to a number of other risks  including the availability of skilled engineering and technical personnel  the availability of other equipment such as fiber optic cable  and the need for local zoning and licensing approvals 
we believe that changes in our customers deployment plans have  and may in the future delay  the receipt of new orders 
since the majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers  a delay in equipment deployment at any one customer has in the past  and could in the future  have a material adverse effect on our sales in a particular quarter 
we may fail to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
the nature of the cable industry makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast demand for our products 
our inability to forecast accurately the actual demand for our products may result in too much or too little supply of products or an over under capacity of manufacturing or testing resources at any given point in time 
the existence of any one or more of these situations could have a negative impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we had purchase obligations of approximately million as of december   primarily to purchase minimum quantities of materials and components used to manufacture our products 
we may be obligated to fulfill these even if demand for our products is lower than we anticipate 
we may not be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
if actual orders differ materially from these indications  our ability to manage inventory and expenses may be affected 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we enter into purchase commitments to acquire materials  or expend resources to manufacture products and such products are not purchased by our customers  our business and operating results could suffer 
we may have financial exposure to litigation 
we and or our directors and officers are defendants in a number of lawsuits  including securities litigation lawsuits 
as a result  we may have financial exposure to litigation as a defendant and because we are obligated to indemnify our officers and members of our board of directors for certain actions taken by our officers and directors on our behalf 
in order to limit financial exposure arising from litigation and or our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors  we have historically purchased directors and officers insurance d o insurance 
however  the availability of d o insurance is becoming more difficult for companies to attain as a number of insurance underwriters no longer offer d o insurance and the remaining insurance underwriters offering d o insurance have significantly increased the premiums of such coverage 
in recent years  we have experienced a significant increase in the cost of our d o insurance  although the cost of our d o insurance decreased in fiscal year there can be no assurance that d o insurance will be available to us in the future or  if d o insurance is available  it may be prohibitively expensive 
additionally  some insurance underwriters who offered d o insurance in the past have been placed into liquidation or may be  at some future point  placed into liquidation 
in october  one of the insurance underwriters from which we purchased d o insurance  reliance insurance co 
reliance  was placed into liquidation by the state of pennsylvania 
reliance was the underwriter for one excess layer of our d o insurance for the period covering the claims made against us and our officers in the pending securities litigation 
because reliance is in liquidation  we paid for the amount insured under the reliance policy  which was million 
we are dependent on key third party suppliers and any failure by them to deliver components could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand 
we manufacture all of our products using components or subassemblies procured from third party suppliers  including semiconductors 
some of these components are available from a sole source and others are available from limited sources 
a majority of our sales are from products containing one or more components 
table of contents that are available only from sole source suppliers 
additionally  some of our components are custom parts that are produced to our specifications  and it may be difficult to move the manufacturing of such components from one vendor to another vendor 
any interruption in the operations of our vendors of sole source or custom product parts could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components  including semiconductors  from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and expose us to potential damages that may arise from our inability to supply our customers with products 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components  such as our semiconductor components  could harm our gross margin or operating results 
additionally  we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we have in the past and in the future may be subject to risk of excess and obsolete inventories  which could harm our business 
in this regard  our gross margins and operating results could be adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory 
we may be unable to migrate to new semiconductor process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop products that utilize new semiconductor process technologies 
these technologies change rapidly and require us to spend significant amounts on research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of redesigning our integrated circuits using smaller geometry process technologies to improve performance and reduce costs 
the transition of our products to integrated circuits with increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
other companies have experienced difficulty in migrating to new semiconductor processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we depend on our relationship with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
our ability to directly control product delivery schedules and product quality is dependent on third party contract manufacturers 
most of our products are assembled and tested by contract manufacturers using testing equipment that we provide 
as a result of our dependence on these contract manufacturers for the assembly and testing of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
in addition  as manufacturing volume increases  we will need to procure and assemble additional testing equipment and provide it to our contract manufacturers 
the production and assembly of testing equipment typically requires significant lead times 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are unable to provide this testing equipment to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner 
we are dependent upon international sales and there are many risks associated with international operations 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the twelve months ended december  and december   approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues were from customers outside of the us international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and communications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  trade barriers  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  
table of contents difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  currency fluctuations  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if our customers are affected by currency devaluations or general economic downturns their ability to purchase our products could be reduced significantly 
payment cycles for international customers typically are longer than those for customers in north america 
while we generally invoice our foreign sales in us dollars  we invoice some of our sales in europe in euros 
since we have also elected to take payment in euros from our customers in europe and may elect to take payment in other foreign currencies in the future  we are exposed to losses as the result of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  we have an israel based operation whose expenses are denominated in israeli nis 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may in the future choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
in addition  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to those foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
furthermore  foreign countries may decide to prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new cable infrastructures for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns and availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the availability and cost of related equipment 
any such action by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
our business may be affected by conditions in israel 
we have significant operations in israel 
our operations in israel consist primarily of research and development  and to a lesser extent sales and manufacturing 
revenues generated by our business in israel were million and million for the twelve months ending december  and december   respectively 
our research and development operations may be significantly affected by conditions in israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have continued over the past year  which could disrupt some of our operations 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel  the future of the peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
a number of our employees based in israel are currently obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
we cannot assess the full impact of these requirements and the hostilities on our workforce  business or operations if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations or the hostilities 
we may be unable to provide adequate customer support 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stages 
spikes in demand of our support services may cause us to be unable to serve our customers 
we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis especially during peak periods 
our inability to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
in addition  our failure to provide adequate support could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and could prevent us from selling product to existing customers or gaining new customers 

table of contents our industry is highly competitive with many larger and more established competitors 
the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change 
our direct competitors include cisco systems  adc  arris  bigband networks  motorola  thomson consumer electronics which markets products under the brand name rca  scientific atlanta and toshiba 
additionally  we face competition from early stage companies with access to significant financial backing that improve existing technologies or develop new technologies 
the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product performance  features and reliability  price  size and stability of operations  breadth of product line  sales and distribution capabilities  technical support and service  relationships with providers of service providers  and compliance with industry standards 
some of these factors are outside of our control 
conditions in the market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements 
the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete 
our competitors may introduce products that are less costly  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  customer support and other resources  as well as better name recognition and access to customers than we do 
the widespread adoption of docsis and other industry standards has and is likely to continue to cause increased price competition 
we believe that the adoption of these standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in lower asps for our products 
any increased price competition or reduction in sales of our products  particularly our higher margin head end products  has resulted and will continue to result in decreased revenue and downward pressure on our gross margin 
these competitive pressures have and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business 
we are dependent on key personnel 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we are highly dependent on the continued service of  and on the ability to attract and retain  qualified engineering  sales  marketing and senior management personnel 
the competition for some of these personnel is intense 
the loss of any of these individuals may harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to hire qualified personnel as needed  we may be unable to adequately manage and grow our business 
highly skilled employees with the education and training that we require  especially employees with significant experience and expertise in video  data networking and radio frequency design  are in high demand 
we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have key person insurance coverage for the loss of any of our employees 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
our employees are not bound by non competition agreements with us 
furthermore  in  we hired a new chief financial officer and a new chief operating officer 
although the addition of these two executive officers has offered us an opportunity to expand our management team with persons that can assist in implementing our new direction  turnover in personnel and the recruitment and retention of a new executive staff may create a number of transitional challenges for us 

table of contents our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products like ours are very complex and can frequently contain undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite testing  errors may occur 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns and other losses to us and or our customers 
this occurrence could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale 
however  these terms and conditions may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products  but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
in addition  even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management s time and other resources 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
even though we seek to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products  there are risks 
we cannot be assured that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot be assured that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 
even if they are granted  the claims covered by any patent may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without a license from us 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our employees into new and enhanced products 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with many of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we may  in the future  take legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively effect our business  operating results  financial position and liquidity 
cablelabs docsis specification includes two modulation techniques  s cdma and a tdma 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs  on a royalty free basis  whereby we licensed to cablelabs many of our intellectual property rights to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks throughout the world 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might 
table of contents not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results and disrupt our business 
as is typical in the industry in which we operate  we have been and may from time to time be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we also believe that companies may be increasingly subject to infringement claims as distressed companies and individuals attempt to generate cash by enforcing their patent portfolio against a wide range of products 
we have consulted with our patent counsel on the claims we have received and are in the process of reviewing the allegations made by such third parties 
we cannot assure you that  if the issues were to be submitted to a court  such court will not find that our products infringe the third party patents  nor that such third parties will not continue to allege infringement 
if we are found to have infringed such third party s patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
additionally  we cannot assure you that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our failure to obtain a license for key intellectual property rights from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacturing of products utilizing the technology 
alternatively  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in developing non infringing technology 
our business and our customers are subject to regulation 
our business and customers are subject to varying degrees of regulation by regulatory bodies in the united states and foreign countries 
although these regulations have not materially restricted our operations to date or the operations of our customers  future regulations applicable to our business or customers could be adopted 
the adoption of future regulations may adversely affect our customers  our ability to sell our products and therefore our operating results 
our products are subject to safety approvals and certifications 
in the united states  our products are required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  we are required to have our products certified by underwriters laboratory in order to meet federal requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
outside the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis or at all the regulatory approvals that may be required for the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  disruptions to our power supply  labor issues and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities and some manufacturing operations are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
in addition  the operations of some of our key suppliers are also located in this area and in other areas known for seismic activity  such as taiwan 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business or the operations of one or more of our key suppliers 
our california operations may also be subject to disruptions in power supply  such as occurred in our business may also be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  service providers  or customers 
such an 
table of contents interruption could harm our operating results 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  we may incur substantially more debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of long term obligations of which million is long term debt associated with our notes 
this level of indebtedness may adversely affect our stockholders by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the terms of our outstanding debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so 
if new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may not be able to raise additional funds to continue operating our business 
our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
in addition and as a result of our history of operating losses  we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash to fund operating losses in the future 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december   from million at december  if our operating losses are more severe than expected or continue longer than expected  we may find it necessary to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital 
given the capital markets  there are few sources of financing available to us 
commercial bank financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
accordingly  any plan to raise additional capital  if available to us  would likely involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as the issuance of convertible debt  common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to procure additional working capital  as necessary  we may be unable to continue operations 
on october   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on november   will allow us to issue various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  from time to time up to an aggregate of million  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
on november   we filed a prospectus supplement with reference to our intention to offer  shares of common stock  which would result in gross proceeds of million 
on november   we withdrew our previously announced public offering of  shares of common stock under the shelf registration statement 
threatened terrorist attacks may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the events of september   as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of components required for the manufacturing of our products  may cause delays or losses of customer orders 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and 
table of contents worldwide financial markets 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
our restructuring efforts could result in the erosion of employee morale  legal actions against us and management distractions  and could impair our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities in the future 
as a result of the significant economic downturn and the related uncertainties in the technology sector  we have implemented a number of restructuring plans  including the most recent in the first quarter of  which has resulted in personnel reduction 
these reductions could result in an erosion of morale  and affect the focus and productivity of our remaining employees  including those directly responsible for revenue generation  which in turn may affect our revenue in the future 
additionally  employees directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although all employees are required to sign a proprietary information agreement with us at the time of hire  there can be no assurances that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
our employees are not bound by non competition agreements with us 
additionally  we may face wrongful termination  discrimination  or other claims from employees affected by the reduction related to their employment and termination 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of such actions 
furthermore  such matters could divert the attention of our employees  including management  away from our operations  harm productivity  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot assure you that our restructuring efforts will be successful  and we may need to take additional restructuring efforts  including additional personnel reduction  in the future 
we may dispose of existing product lines  which may adversely impact our future results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our various product offerings in order to determine whether any should be discontinued or  to the extent possible  divested 
moreover  the worldwide downturn in the telecommunications industry led us to reassess our business strategy  which in turn caused us to discontinue investment in certain product lines 
specifically  we have reduced our investment in the telecom and satellite spaces 
beginning in july  we entered into two transactions to further decrease our telecom business 
in july  we discontinued our mainsail line of products and entered into an agreement with a third party to supply warranty services for the mainsail products 
in july  we entered into an agreement with verilink corporation verilink to sell certain telecom assets associated with the miniplex product line to verilink 
additionally  verilink agreed to purchase related inventory from us and assume all telecom warranty obligations with the exception of million  which will continue to be our responsibility 
we cannot assure you that we correctly forecasted the right product lines to discontinue or that our decision to discontinue various investments and product lines is prudent if market conditions change 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the discontinuance of various product lines will reduce our operating expenses 
furthermore  future plans to discontinue existing product lines entail various risks  including the risks that we will not be able to find a buyer for a product line or the purchase price obtained will not be equal to the book value of the assets for the product line 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
for example  we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
as a result  we recorded an aggregate of approximately million related to impairment charges and write down of in 
table of contents process research and development related to the acquired technologies  both of which negatively impacted our operating results 
to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products  if our products are not i cost effective  ii brought to market in a timely manner  iii in accordance with evolving industry standards and architecture or iv fail to achieve market acceptance 
there is no assurance that the technologies we are currently developing or intend to develop will achieve feasibility  or that even if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product developments and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets  which could result in material losses 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with payment terms of to days typically in the united states  and because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
beyond our open credit arrangements  we have also experienced a request for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements  which we have not provided to date and do not expect to provide in the future 
we expect demand for enhanced open credit terms  for example  longer payment terms  customer financing and leasing arrangements to continue and believe that such arrangements are a competitive factor in obtaining business 
our decision not to provide these types of financing arrangements may adversely affect our ability to sell product  and therefore  our revenue  operations and business 
because of the current condition in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks relating to sales on an open credit basis has increased 
although we monitor and attempt to mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective in reducing credit risk 
additionally  there have been significant insolvencies and bankruptcies among our customers  which have and may continue to cause us to incur economic and financial losses 
there can be no assurance that additional losses would not be incurred and that such losses would not be material 
although these losses have generally not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have and we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions  acquisitions could disrupt our business operations and harm our operating results 
in order to expand our business  we may make strategic acquisitions of other companies or certain assets 
we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time  and may make an acquisition at some future point 
however  the current volatility in the stock market and the current price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to make such acquisitions 
any acquisition that we make involves substantial risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 

table of contents acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
we recorded impairment losses of approximately million and million of intangible assets related to these acquisitions in december  and as of december   no intangible assets from these acquisitions remained 
various export licensing requirements could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
various government export regulations may apply to the encryption or other features of our products 
we may have to make certain filings with the government in order to obtain permission to export certain of our products 
in the past  we may have inadvertently failed to file certain export applications and notices  and we may have to make certain filings and request permission to continue exportation of any affected products without interruption while these applications are pending 
if we do have to make such filings  we cannot assure you that we will obtain permission to continue exporting the affected products or that we will obtain any required export approvals now or in the future 
if we do not receive the required export approvals  we may be unable to ship those products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
in addition  we may be subject to fines or other penalties due to the failure to file certain export applications and notices 
new laws and regulations affecting corporate governance may impede our ability to retain and attract board members and executive officers  and increase the costs associated with being a public company 
on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the new act is designed to enhance corporate responsibility through new corporate governance and disclosure obligations  increase auditor independence  and tougher penalties for securities fraud 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq have adopted rules in furtherance of the act and are considering adopting others 
this act and the related new rules and regulations will likely have the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our company s corporate governance and the time our executive officers spend on such issues  and may increase the risk of personal liability for our board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other executives involved in our company s corporate governance process 
as a result  it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain board members and executive officers involved in the corporate governance process 
in addition  we have experienced  and will continue to 
table of contents experience  increased costs associated with being a public company  including additional professional and independent auditor fees 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the broadband services industry  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of internet  online service or broadband service industries  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion or compatibility of our technology with such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the stock price of broadband services and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility 
this volatility and decline has affected many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
additionally  industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which  together with provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  may delay or prevent an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of february  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting a take over of us  even if such a change in control is beneficial to our stockholders  without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors 
additionally  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors  and we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
future sales of shares by existing stockholders could affect our stock price 
the shares held by our stockholders  including our executive officers and directors  may be sold in the public market at any time and from time to time subject in certain cases to volume limitations under rule of the securities act of and various vesting agreements 
if any of these stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
in 
table of contents addition  shares subject to outstanding options and shares reserved for future issuance under our stock option and purchase plans will continue to become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the various vesting agreements and the securities rules and regulations applicable to these shares 
item a 
market risk disclosure information interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which mature within the next twenty four months 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions from belgium  united kingdom  hong kong  canada  and israel 
a hypothetical adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially
