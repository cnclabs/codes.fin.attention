executive overview bombay markets a line of proprietary home furnishings that includes large furniture  occasional furniture  wall decor and decorative accessories that is timeless and classic in its styling 
over of the items are imported  with more than half of the product coming from china 
we are a multi channel retailer with store locations  internet and mail order operations  so that the customer can shop at her convenience 
we have a small wholesale operation that is immaterial to overall revenue but contributes incrementally to profitability 
we focus on several key metrics in managing and evaluating our operating performance and financial condition including the following same store sales  sales and gross margins by merchandise categories  operating margins as a percentage of revenues  earnings per share  cash flow  return on assets and inventory turn 
we are currently executing a multi phase turnaround intended to improve bombay s profitability and generate competitive operating results in line with current market leaders in the sector 
for the year  our operating margin was of revenues compared to industry leaders in the to range 
we do not believe that  long term  there is anything structurally that would prevent us from improving our operating results to approach those of industry leaders 
phase i of the turnaround commenced during the third quarter of fiscal and continued into fiscal our goal was to reclaim market share  generating above average same store sales and validating our positioning within the market place 
we reported consecutive months of double digit same store sales increases beginning in september and continuing through september as a result of the strength of these sales  we were able to leverage many of our fixed costs including our buying and occupancy costs  which declined to of revenues during fiscal from of revenues during fiscal phase i was also characterized by the aggressive repositioning of our real estate portfolio 
during the s and s  our focus was on opening stores in a malls throughout north america 
as shopping habits have evolved  with alternative venues such as lifestyle centers and big box strip centers gaining popularity  we have begun to migrate our stores to off mall locations 
in addition to being more convenient for customers and suitable for the sale of large items  such locations typically have lower cost structures  both from a fixed rent perspective and for other common area expenses billed by landlords 
management believes that the movement to the off mall locations will ultimately result in lower fixed costs for bombay and will help improve profitability 
during fiscal  approximately leases expired  and we took advantage of that opportunity to close some of our mall stores and move to nearby off mall locations 
we are currently focusing on our top markets to obtain market density and leverage fixed logistics and advertising costs in those areas 
additionally  we have restarted net store growth  which has been relatively flat in number since a total of real estate projects  including new stores and relocations  were completed during the year resulting in opening new off mall locations 
the total number of stores grew to  a net increase of stores 
the following table reflects the real estate portfolio at each fiscal year end january february february units of total units of total units of total mall off mall outlet total another key aspect of phase i included aggressively investing in marketing to attract new customers to bombay and support the move from mall to off mall 
during the late s and early s  we had become increasingly reliant on periodic catalogs to drive customers into the store and did not have marketing vehicles with a broader reach 
in fiscal  the marketing expenditures reached their historical low of of revenues 
during fiscal and fiscal  we increased our marketing to and of revenues  respectively  with much of the incremental spending going to support a program for monthly inserts in sunday newspapers in our top markets 
in addition to investing in new stores  we began making some key investments in our infrastructure that will serve as the foundation upon which we plan to grow to become a billion dollar company with competitive operating margins 
during fiscal  we rolled out a new point of sale system and a broadband communication network to our us stores  completed the implementation of the first phase of a new planning and allocation system  opened a new  square foot distribution center in the midwest and made key investments in leadership positions  including the appointment of a new chief executive officer and a new chief information officer 
investments in product margin  inventory  infrastructure and advertising led to a increase in revenues  improvement in operating margins from to of revenue  and improvement in return on assets from to 
as we enter fiscal and the second phase of the turnaround  we are focused on six critical success factors 
drive same store sales at a competitive rate average store level productivity was increased as a result of last year s same store sales performance 
longer term  we need to continue to defend our market share and ultimately grow sales at a rate at  or above  the competition 
successfully continue the migration of our stores from mall to off mall locations we expect to improve operating margins to basis points over time as stores are relocated to lower cost  off mall locations 
during fiscal  approximately additional leases will expire and the migration will continue at an accelerated pace with plans to end the year with over of our stores being off mall 
grow store count our goal is to increase the number of core bombay stores annually and continue to open new concepts such as bombaykids 
the focus will be on our top markets where we believe we can add almost bombay stores without exceeding current penetration limits 
market density is expected to result in leveraging fixed costs and improving operating efficiencies 
develop bombaykids by the end of fiscal  we expect to have bombaykids stores  providing the critical mass to yield better returns for the business 
success in the bombaykids business will enable us to demonstrate our ability to organically develop other concepts that leverage our core competencies and provide new growth vehicles 
build the proper infrastructure to support future growth it is essential that we invest in systems  our logistics network and corporate competencies in order to avoid the pitfalls that scale and complexity can create 
while it is tempting to forego such investments in favor of short term profits  we believe that they are critical for long term growth and will be accretive to future earnings 
planned infrastructure investments will include supply chain improvements  further enhancements to the us point of sale system and its rollout to the canadian subsidiary  sku level planning and plannogramming  expansion of distribution facilities in the northeast  and the addition of a new general merchandise manager and a new vice president of financial planning and analysis 
generate profit margin expansion this  in many ways  will be the result of executing the first five critical success factors well 
the key to profit margin expansion will be the focus on and delivery of profit flow through and return on new stores 
half of the opportunity lies in migrating to off mall as we reduce fixed occupancy costs and lower our overall cost structure 
approximately of our future improvement lies in leveraging our top line growth in the areas of selling  general and administrative expenses and logistics 
the remainder will come from improving product margins as we reap the benefits of new systems designed to help ensure better flow of product from source to store  improve inventory turn and manage promotional activities 
the infrastructure that we develop and the investments that we make will be critical to the third phase of our turnaround strategy 
our plan is to organically develop other retail concepts and areas of operations that would leverage our core competencies and become new growth vehicles for bombay 
this longer term strategy is several years in the future and is dependent on successfully accomplishing earlier phases  which will be the focus for fiscal and beyond 
fiscal will result in the second consecutive year of accelerated investment in bombay with capital expenditures planned to be in the to million range 
our strategy from a balance sheet perspective is to utilize our credit facilities with banks to finance our seasonal working capital needs  and to fund our capital growth from working capital from operations and from our balance sheet 
other disclosures the largest percentage of our sales and operating income is realized in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes december christmas season 
the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant because the majority of our products are proprietary 
we attempt to alleviate inflationary pressures by improving designs  finding alternative production sources in lower cost countries and increasing selling prices subject to competitive conditions 
one of the risks we are currently facing relates to the recent anti dumping petition against chinese furniture makers for alleged dumping of wooden bedroom furniture 
the petition is currently working its way through the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce 
the final determinations of the commission will not be made until but imposition of preliminary duties will begin in spring slightly more than of our assortment is classified as bedroom furniture  not all of which is imported from china or may be subject to such duties 
our sourcing offices in asia have been identifying alternative vendors in other countries including vietnam  where some of our existing vendors have chosen to open manufacturing facilities 
we have already begun to move production of many of the bedroom furniture items to these alternate factories 
we cannot predict what amount  if any  of disruption there might be as manufacturers shift their production to other locales or what level of duties related price increases we will be able to pass on to our customers for those items that we choose to continue to source from china 
we believe that  with our established network of offices throughout asia and the strength of our relationships with our vendors  we will be able to negotiate arrangements that will allow us to continue offering all product categories on a competitive basis 
we have a retail week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest january all periods presented reflect weeks

corporate general and administrative costs declined slightly as a percentage of revenue primarily due to leverage in payroll and depreciation and amortization of systems partially offset by higher insurance costs 
interest fiscal during fiscal  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal decline in interest income and increase in expense are the result of lower invested cash balances and greater utilization of the credit facility in the current year 
funds were primarily used to finance our capital expansion plan  with the addition of locations  and higher inventory levels to support both the higher store count and the increase in same store sales 
fiscal during fiscal  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal improvement resulted from higher average cash balances generated through higher sales and profits  lower capital expenditures and lower average inventory levels  resulting in lower utilization of the credit facility 
in addition  borrowings were at lower interest rates 
income taxes we provided income taxes of million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective rates were  and in the respective periods 
fluctuations in the effective rate were primarily related to foreign taxes that change in accordance with earnings in the canadian subsidiary and in state tax expenses that have not changed proportionately to income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and a line of credit with banks 
we have an unsecured  revolving credit agreement with a group of banks  with an aggregate commitment of up to million for working capital and letter of credit purposes 
the bank commitment is limited to of saleable inventory 
at january   the bank commitment was million  and million was available for borrowings or additional letters of credit 
the credit facility expires july fiscal during fiscal  we used million of cash  ending the year with million in cash and long term investments 
the decline in the level of cash from fiscal  for both year end comparisons and throughout the period  is due to our higher capital expenditures and corresponding inventory levels in fiscal to support the additional stores and growth in same store sales 
the primary sources of cash were net income  including non cash depreciation  amortization expense and deferred tax expense  as well as the exercise of stock options 
cash was primarily used for capital expansion  partially offset by construction allowances granted by landlords  and to purchase additional inventory to support the larger store base and increased same store sales 
other significant uses of cash included the payment of federal income taxes and a decrease in other current assets  primarily due to a decrease in prepaid rent resulting from the timing of the end of the fiscal period 
capital expenditures totaled million and included the costs of opening large format stores  kids stores  one outlet  a distribution center in plainfield  indiana  investments in new point of sale  planning and allocation and other systems and routine purchases of equipment 
these expenditures were partially offset by construction allowances of million granted by landlords 
at january   inventory levels were million or million higher than at february  this increase represents investments to support the additional number of stores and higher sales levels 
the year end level was above desired levels as a result of aggressively buying to christmas sales that did not materialize 
the investments were made primarily in core merchandise which will continue to be offered as part of the product offering 
as a result  future orders will be adjusted to reflect the higher on hand quantities 
we do not expect the higher inventory levels to have a material impact on gross margins 
however  we will closely monitor inventory sell through and take appropriate actions  as necessary  to maximize inventory productivity 
long term  our strategy is to utilize our credit facility to finance seasonal borrowings and to utilize cash flow from operations and our balance sheet to finance our capital programs 
for fiscal  the capital expenditures plan is estimated to be to million and includes the addition large format stores and bombaykids stores 
we expect to close large format and regular stores  and to end fiscal with approximately locations 
other capital expenditure plans include further enhancements to the point of sale system and its roll out to the canadian subsidiary  expansion of distribution facilities in the northeast and routine purchases of equipment 
in connection with continuing operations  we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments requiring payment in future periods  summarized in the table below 
payments due by period in thousands total less than after year years years years contractual obligations real estate operating leases      unconditional purchase orders   equipment operating leases   employment contracts   other contractual obligations    total contractual cash obligations 
     commercial commitments import letters of credit   standby letters of credit   guarantees of travel cards total commercial commitments   with our current growth plans  we anticipate that we will need to increase our borrowing capabilities to finance our pre holiday build up of inventory in fiscal we currently intend to take advantage of the favorable credit environment to increase our overall borrowing capabilities 
we are exploring various alternatives  including increasing our existing facility  and will assess our options during the upcoming months 
fiscal at february   cash and short term investments were million  million higher than at february  the primary sources of cash were net income including non cash depreciation and amortization expense  increases in payables including those related to higher inventory purchases  taxes  payroll and insurance as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
these sources were partially offset by higher inventory levels and capital expenditures for store construction and routine equipment purchases 
at february   inventory levels were million higher than at the previous year end due to improved flow of product to support the strong sales trend experienced during the second half of fiscal  and to support continued growth into fiscal capital expenditures totaled million and included the costs of new stores and the conversion of two regular stores to the larger format  as well as continued investments in software and equipment 
critical accounting policies in the course of preparing the financial statements  management makes certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in the circumstances and the application of those policies 
the following policies are those deemed to be most critical 
inventory valuation policy inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory method 
cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is not present or for which an allocation of shared costs is required 
in addition  we include the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores in our costs 
we regularly evaluate our compliance with the lower of cost or market principle 
items are evaluated by sku and to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price  provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item 
additionally  we review the aging of our inventory by sku 
the carrying cost of the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category 
since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both estimation and judgment of cost and market value  differences in these estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded asset 
each month  we record an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the cost of lost or stolen inventory 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at least annually to reflect current circumstances 
inventory is physically counted at all locations at least once each year  at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements 
physical counts were taken at all stores and all the distribution centers during january impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets with definite lives at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
this review includes the evaluation of individual under performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store 
future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life using a probability weighted approach to estimate the fair value of the store assets 
these projections consider such factors as future sales levels  gross margins  changes in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  we record a charge equal to the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value as an impairment 
since the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates  differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results 
deferred taxes we currently have recorded million of deferred tax assets representing the difference between the timing of deductions taken for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes 
in order to take the benefit of those assets  we must have future taxable income 
if future conditions indicate that the benefit of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the assets to their estimated realizable value 
insurance we are self insured with respect to medical and dental insurance coverage offered to our eligible employees  up to a maximum of  per claim 
above that amount  medical insurance coverage is in place 
in connection with the self insured portion  we maintain a liability for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to our insurance carrier 
we base the amount of the liability upon historical claims experience and actuarial estimates regarding the exposure for claims incurred but not yet reported 
at january   the balance of the medical and dental liability was  since fiscal  we have also maintained workers compensation insurance coverage with a deductible of up to  per claim 
at january   we had recorded a liability of million representing the estimated amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims under the insurance policies for fiscal through fiscal the amount of the liability reflects expected remaining workers compensation claims based upon actuarial estimates  utilizing historical claims experience and other relevant information and trends 
prior to fiscal  our workers compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible 
if circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate that future payments with respect to insurance liabilities would be different than what was previously estimated  we will adjust such liabilities accordingly 
since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various estimates  actual future requirements could vary from the recorded liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements during fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have also adopted the provisions of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
requires that certain costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that have certain characteristics 
in december  the fasb amended and clarified fin by issuing fin r 
the fasb has postponed the effective date of fin r to the first quarter of fiscal  at which time we will adopt the provisions of the standard 
we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based upon the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have exposure to interest rate risk  as borrowings under our credit facility are based upon libor  prime and other benchmark rates which may fluctuate with market conditions 
based upon our seasonal borrowing levels  management does not believe that a change in interest rates of basis points would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of january  we had no debt or other market risk sensitive instruments
