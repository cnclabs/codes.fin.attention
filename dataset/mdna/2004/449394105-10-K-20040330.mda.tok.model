item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed below and in the section entitled risk factors 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic products 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have funded our research and development primarily from equity derived working capital  through strategic alliances and collaborations with other companies and through government research funding  primarily from the national institutes of health in the form of grants and contracts 
we have not been profitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in july  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genencor 
the revenue that we recognize from genencor includes milestone payments  recognition of upfront license fees over the term of the contract and contract revenue to support our research and development activities over the term of the collaboration 
as of december   genencor owned approximately of our common stock and was therefore considered a related party for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  all payments that we have received under this agreement are itemized under the category  related party revenue 
in february  we preliminarily agreed with anosys  inc to merge our operations to create a combined company focused on the field of immunotherapeutics and products for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases 
in august  we announced that the merger agreement between epimmune and anosys was terminated 
in connection with the termination of the merger agreement  we recorded a charge of million during the second quarter of  which is included in general and administrative costs  to write off costs we had incurred in connection with the proposed merger 
in september  we announced a reduction of our work force aimed at focusing our efforts on our most advanced clinical programs and our sponsored and partnered programs 
we reduced our research and administrative staff by individuals or  which resulted in a one time restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of in september  dr 
loria  our president and ceo surrendered an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  including  unvested shares  at the fair market value of per share  in exchange for 
table of contents the prepayment of the outstanding principal and interest under a promissory note issued by dr 
loria in january for the purchase of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the aggregate value of the shares surrendered was  the remaining  unvested shares will vest in equal daily installments between september  and january  we continue to have the right to purchase any unvested shares at the purchase price paid by dr 
loria in the event of termination of dr 
loria s service to us 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash  stock based compensation charge of approximately  in the third quarter of based on the difference between the fair market price on september  and the exercise price of the shares surrendered by dr 
loria 
we will also recognize an additional  in non cash  stock based compensation charges ratably over the period from september  to january  as the remaining  unvested shares vest 
subsequent events in march  genencor assigned its rights under our collaboration to innogenetics nv 
in connection with the assignment by genencor  we extended the collaboration term with innogenetics through september innogenetics will have the right to terminate the collaboration early  upon three months written notice 
significant accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  patents and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
collaboration revenues are earned and recognized as research costs are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
license fees are earned and recognized in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
upfront license fees for perpetual licenses where we have no performance obligations are recognized when received 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recognized over the term of the agreement 
for example  in connection with our genencor collaboration  because we received an upfront license fee  it is being amortized into revenue over the collaboration term 
fees paid to initiate research projects are deferred and recognized over the project period 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the completion of the milestone as long as the milestone event was substantive  and its achievability was not reasonably assured at inception and our performance obligations after milestone achievement will continue to be funded at a comparable level before the milestone achievement 
revenues from grants are recognized on a percentage of completion basis as related costs are incurred 
we defer revenue recognition until performance obligations have been completed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
patents we capitalize the costs incurred to file patent applications when we believe there is a high likelihood that the patent will issue and there will be future economic benefit associated with the patent 
these costs are 
table of contents amortized over a ten year life from the date of patent filing 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
in addition  we review the carrying value of patents for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents or we determine that the carrying value is impaired  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of the abandonment 
investment policy the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving competitive yields  without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we primarily invest in cash and money market accounts as well as a or p or higher rated debt securities with maturities of less than two years  with the weighted average maturity not to exceed eighteen months 
we also attempt to minimize our portfolio risk by placing constraints on how much of our portfolio may be held in a specific type of investment such as asset backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations as well as limiting our holdings in any one issuer 
at december   our investment portfolio included only cash and money market accounts and had no fixed income securities 
results of operations we had total revenue of million for the year ended december  and million for the year december  a decrease of million in related party revenue from genencor in was offset by an increase of million in licensing fees and milestone revenue and a million increase in grant and contract revenue during the decrease of million in related party revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to the shift in focus of our collaboration with genencor from scientific research activities  the part of the collaboration in which we are most involved  to preclinical development on the lead program in support of a late investigational new drug  or ind  filing by genencor  lower non recurring milestone payments received in compared to  and an increase in the time period during which the license fees previously paid by genencor are being amortized due to the extension of the collaboration term 
the change in the estimated life of the license occurred due to the extension of the collaboration term from september  to september  the agreement term was extended in october of in march  genencor assigned its rights under our collaboration to innogenetics nv 
in connection with the assignment by genencor  we extended the collaboration term with innogenetics through september innogenetics will have the right to terminate the collaboration early  upon three months written notice 
the increase of million in licensing fees and milestone revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was due to the receipt of one time payments for license fees and milestones during under the terms of our agreement with anosys  and an increase in licensing revenue as a result of amortization of evaluation fees and license fees received from aventis  idm  beckman coulter  merck and amgen in  compared to the increase of million in grant and contract revenue in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  was due to higher reimbursable expenses on several existing grants and contracts during than in and reimbursement of expenses on a new contract we received in september of from the nih to develop a preventive hiv vaccine 
our revenue of million for the year ended december  compares to total revenue of million for the year ended december  the decrease of in relates primarily to a reduction of million in license fees and milestone payments we received compared to  partially offset by an increase of million in related party revenue we received in compared to license fee and milestone revenue for the year ended december  included recognition of non recurring license fees associated with numerous license agreements we entered into during that period  including agreements with biosite  anosys  nexell and pharmexa 
for the year ended december   we received million in research grants and contract revenue compared to million received in the year ended december  we had related party revenue of million in the year ended december  compared to million of related party revenue in the year ended december  the increase in related party revenue was due 
table of contents to reimbursement for expenditures on our genencor collaboration and amortization of license fees associated with the genencor collaboration that was entered into in july research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in the year ended december  relates primarily to lower outside costs related to preclinical activities such as formulation and toxicology studies for our hiv and lung and colorectal cancer programs  which are now in clinical trials  lower scientific supplies costs related to completion of preclinical activities  lower patent and intellectual property related expenses  and reduced labor costs related to our work force reduction  partially offset by higher costs associated with outside research support related to our high throughput screening contract with the nih and outside research and development support on a new contract we received in september of from the nih to develop a preventive hiv vaccine 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in relates primarily to an increase of million in outside costs related to preclinical activities such as formulation and toxicology studies for our hiv and lung and colorectal cancer programs  an increase of million in labor and related costs  including recruitment and relocation as a result of an increase in our personnel responsible for research and development activities  an increase of million associated with amortization and other costs related to increased spending to prosecute our patent portfolio and an increase of million on scientific supplies due to increased research and development efforts and our collaboration with genencor 
we expect to continue to incur costs in for  among other things  outside costs related to clinical trials and development activities for our new nih contract for a preventive hiv vaccine  product formulation and manufacturing of product for use in clinical trials  medical and clinical consultant costs and product development costs for additional vaccine candidates 
general and administrative costs were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in the year ended december  was due to recognition of non cash  stock based compensation charges in connection with the prepayment of a promissory note by our ceo in september  other non cash  stock based compensation expenses related to a higher stock price for variable stock equity instruments  and the write off of legal  investment banking  accounting and other expenses related to our proposed merger with anosys  which was terminated 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in consultant fees and other outside costs  and a reduction in travel expenses 
general and administrative costs were approximately million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily due to million less paid for bonuses in compared to  a benefit of million of stock compensation related to a lower stock price for variable stock equity instruments  and a decrease of million in legal expenses in compared to these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in payroll and related expenses and a million increase in consultant expenses in compared to in september  we announced a reduction of our work force aimed at reducing our cash burn and focusing our efforts on our most advanced clinical programs and our sponsored and partnered programs 
we reduced our research and administrative staff by individuals or  which resulted in a one time restructuring charge of approximately  in the year ended december  we had no restructuring related charges in or net interest income was approximately million in compared to million in and million in interest income during includes approximately million of interest accrued on the note issued for the purchase in january of our common stock by dr 
loria  our president and chief executive officer  compared to approximately million of interest accrued on the note in we had lower average cash balances and rates of return in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  higher average cash balances in were offset by lower average returns than in due to lower interest rates 

table of contents we expect to incur operating losses over at least the next several years due to continuing expenses associated with our research and development programs  including clinical trials  preclinical testing and development activities 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing and amounts of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of our equity securities  two public common stock offerings  license fees  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues  capital and operating lease transactions  certain asset divestitures and interest income 
through december  we have raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities  of which million was raised to fund the business since the formation of our business related to immunotherapy 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding on an as converted to common stock basis  assuming conversion of the series s and s preferred shares 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to million of cash used to fund the company s research and development and clinical activities and million of cash for capitalized patent costs 
our operating expenses were offset by license fees  milestone payments and grant and contract revenues we received 
we expect to continue to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our ongoing and future clinical trials  as well as our drug research and development programs 
we expect our net cash burn rate to decrease in compared to due to increased reimbursement of research and development costs as a result of a new contract we received in september of from the nih to develop a preventive hiv vaccine 
we had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the expenditures for were primarily for small laboratory equipment 
the expenditures for were primarily for laboratory equipment to increase and improve immunological screening throughput  to build out additional laboratory space to accommodate additional employees and for information technology equipment and upgrades to accommodate new employees 
capital expenditures for were primarily for laboratory equipment 
in the past  we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
during  and we made payments under the notes payable of million  million and million  respectively 
during  we fully paid off our outstanding note payable 
during  we anticipate that payments related to capital expenditures will increase modestly compared to levels to a range of approximately million to million  primarily for the purchase of equipment to support our clinical trials 
we will also pay approximately million in rent on our lease commitments during the future minimum rental commitment for the lease of our facility will range from approximately million to million each year over six years  based upon pre established annual rent increases 
payments related to capitalized patent expenses were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to is due primarily to consolidation of our patent portfolio with one outside law firm to limit administrative redundancies as well as bringing certain administrative tasks in house to limit outside legal expenses 
the increase in compared to was primarily as a result of maturity of our portfolio filings and pursuit of additional claims 
we expect payments related to patents to be relatively flat in compared to as we anticipate seeing a full year of benefit of our portfolio consolidation with one outside law firm  and as we continue to perform administrative tasks in house whenever possible as we pursue filings and claims in our intellectual property portfolio 
although we expect our net cash burn to decrease in  we expect to incur higher research and development expenditures in compared to levels in connection with our ongoing drug research and development programs  including costs related to clinical trials  research and development activities on sponsored programs and contracts  preclinical testing of product candidates and manufacturing of clinical supplies 
we intend to seek collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate 
table of contents partners and us government agencies 
we have in the past and may in the future also license to third parties some of our technology in markets that we are not pursuing ourselves or through our collaborations 
any agreements that may result from these discussions may not successfully reduce our funding requirements or  if entered into  may be terminated 
we currently anticipate that total revenue for will be in the range of million to million  which includes anticipated grant and contract revenue  related party revenue and certain license fees 
our estimate assumes that we recognize revenue from milestone or licensing payments under existing agreements with third parties related to the licensing of our technology 
we also anticipate that operating expenses for the full year will rise from million in to between approximately million and million  representing a to increase over the anticipated rise in expenses relates to our ongoing phase i ii clinical trials targeting hiv  lung cancer and colorectal cancer and an increase in expenses under funded grants and contracts from the nih 
we also anticipate using some of our cash in to fund certain activities in our collaboration with bavarian nordic 
we will share equally with bavarian nordic in all research related expenses not covered under our hiv vaccine contract from the nih and have included these anticipated expenditures in our operating expense forecast for we will also become liable in for payment of license fees of up to million 
with existing cash and interest earned thereon  along with receipts from existing contracts  we expect to be able to maintain our current level of operations through and into the second quarter of  based on anticipated expenditures 
we will continue to spend substantial amounts on research and development  including amounts spent for manufacturing clinical supplies  conducting clinical trials for our product candidates and advancing development of certain sponsored and partnered programs 
therefore  we will need to obtain additional funding 
we do not have committed external sources of funding and may not be able to obtain any additional funding  especially if volatile market conditions persist for biotechnology companies 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding  we will be required to delay  further reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development projects  sell the company or certain of its assets or technologies  or dissolve and liquidate all of its assets 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
our future operational and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether we are able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all  the costs associated with our clinical trials for our vaccine targeting hiv  which began in september  including the status of our contract with the nih  the costs associated with our clinical trials for our vaccine targeting lung and colorectal cancer  which began in february  progress with other preclinical testing and clinical trials in the future  our ability to establish and maintain collaboration and license agreements and any government contracts and grants  the actual revenue we receive under our collaboration and license agreements  the actual costs we incur under our research collaboration with bavarian nordic  the actual payment of license fees which may become payable at the option of the licensor  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and any other proprietary rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing research relationships  
table of contents continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  and the magnitude of our drug discovery and development programs 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  our commercial success will depend in part on not infringing upon the patent or other proprietary rights of others and maintaining the technology licenses upon which our products might be based 
our business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with our ability to enter into and maintain new collaborations  the lengthy regulatory approval process  and potential competition from other products 
even if our products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to  our inability to fund clinical development of such products  or the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than years years more than total year years unaudited in thousands operating lease obligations licensing and purchase obligations deferred compensation total facilities lease  which expires in march licensing and purchase obligations includes an estimate of  for future payment obligations under existing license agreements which may become due and payable in the periods specified based on projected achievement of triggering events  although there can be no assurance such events will be achieved in the projected time frames  if at all
