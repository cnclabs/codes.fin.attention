the line from tyler to el dorado varies in diameter from inches to inches 
the line from mcrae to west memphis has a inch diameter 
the products pipeline system also includes a inch diameter line from seymour to chicago  illinois  and a inch diameter line running from lebanon to lima  ohio 
this inch diameter pipeline connects to the buckeye pipe line company system that serves  among others  markets in michigan and eastern ohio 
the products pipeline system also has a inch diameter pipeline connection to the greater cincinnati northern kentucky international airport and an inch diameter pipeline connection to the george bush intercontinental airport in houston 
in addition  the products pipeline system contains numerous lines  ranging in size from inches to inches in diameter  associated with the gathering and distribution system  extending from baytown to beaumont  texas city to baytown  pasadena  texas to baytown and baytown to mont belvieu 
the products pipeline system continues eastward from todhunter  ohio  to greensburg  pennsylvania  at which point it branches into two segments  one ending in selkirk  new york near albany  and the other ending at marcus hook  pennsylvania near philadelphia 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter and ending in selkirk is an inch diameter line  and the line starting at greensburg and ending at marcus hook varies in diameter from inches to inches 
in december  we completed an upgrade of our princeton  indiana  lpg truck rack to increase its capacity 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a phase i project to expand our delivery capacity of lpgs in the northeast 
the phase i expansion increased delivery capability to the northeast during the peak winter months by approximately one million barrels 
the expansion consisted of the construction of three new pump stations located between middletown  ohio  and coshocton  ohio 
during the fourth quarter of  we began projects to increase our truck rack capacity in the northeast at locations in new york and pennsylvania in order to improve customer service to those areas 
these projects are scheduled to be completed in early additionally  in  we have begun a phase ii project to further expand our delivery capability to the northeast by constructing three new pump stations located between coshocton and greensburg  pennsylvania  and two new pump stations located between greensburg and watkins glen  new york 
the phase ii projects are anticipated to be completed during the fourth quarter of we have also approved a project for construction of a new truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana  which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 
table of contents te products also owns three inch diameter common carrier petrochemical pipelines between mont belvieu and port arthur 
each of these pipelines is approximately miles in length 
the pipelines transport ethylene  propylene and natural gasoline 
we entered into a year agreement in with a major petrochemical producer for guaranteed throughput commitments 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue under the throughput and deficiency contract 
we began transporting product through these pipelines in september our downstream segment also includes the operations of the northern portion of the dean pipeline 
beginning in january  the northern portion of the dean pipeline was converted to transport rgp from mont belvieu to point comfort 
the northern portion of the dean pipeline consists of miles of pipeline from mont belvieu to point comfort 
we believe that our products pipeline system is in compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations and accepted industry standards and practices 
we perform regular maintenance on all the facilities of the products pipeline system and have an ongoing process of inspecting the products pipeline system and making repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate 
in addition  we conduct periodic air patrols of the products pipeline system to monitor pipeline integrity and third party right of way encroachments 
major business sector markets our major operations in the downstream segment consist of the transportation  storage and terminaling of refined petroleum products and lpgs along our mainline system 
product deliveries  in millions of barrels mmbbls on a regional basis  for the years ended december   and  were as follows product deliveries mmbbls years ended december  refined products mainline transportation central midwest ohio and kentucky subtotal lpgs mainline transportation central  midwest and kentucky ohio and northeast subtotal total mainline transportation petrochemical transportation total product deliveries arkansas  louisiana  missouri and texas

petrochemical transportation between mont belvieu and port arthur  texas  has not been included as those volumes are with one customer 
the mix of products delivered varies seasonally 
gasoline demand is generally stronger in the spring and summer months and lpgs demand is generally stronger in the fall and winter months 
weather and economic conditions in the geographic areas served by our products pipeline system also affect the demand for  and the mix of  the products delivered 

table of contents refined products and lpgs deliveries for the years ended december   and  were as follows product deliveries mmbbls years ended december  refined products mainline transportation gasoline jet fuels distillates subtotal lpgs mainline transportation propane butanes subtotal total mainline transportation petrochemical transportation total product deliveries primarily diesel fuel  heating oil and other middle distillates 
refined products mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports refined petroleum products from the upper texas gulf coast  eastern texas and southern arkansas to the central and midwest regions of the united states with deliveries in texas  louisiana  arkansas  missouri  illinois  kentucky  indiana and ohio 
at these points  refined petroleum products are delivered to terminals owned by te products  connecting pipelines and customer owned terminals 
the volume of refined petroleum products transported by our products pipeline system is directly affected by the demand for refined products in the geographic regions the system serves 
this market demand varies based upon the different end uses to which the refined products deliveries are applied 
demand for gasoline  which accounted for approximately of the volume of refined products transported through the products pipeline system during  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets that we serve 
demand for distillates is affected by truck and railroad freight  the price of natural gas used by utilities  which use distillates as a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas is high  and usage for agricultural operations  which is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel depends upon prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
market prices for refined petroleum products affect the demand in the markets served by our downstream segment 
therefore  quantities and mix of products transported may vary 
transportation tariffs of refined petroleum products vary among specific product types 
as a result  market price volatility may affect transportation volumes and revenues from period to period 
lpgs mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports lpgs from the upper texas gulf coast to the central  midwest and northeast regions of the united states 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter  ohio  is devoted solely to the transportation of lpgs 
because propane demand is generally sensitive to weather in the winter months  year to year variations of propane deliveries have occurred and will likely continue to occur 
our products pipeline system also transports normal butane and isobutane in the midwest and northeast for use in the production of motor gasoline 
our ability in the downstream segment to serve propane markets in the northeast is enhanced by our marine import terminal at providence 
this facility includes a  barrel refrigerated storage tank along with 
table of contents ship unloading and truck loading facilities 
effective may  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of defs to commit sole utilization of the providence terminal to an affiliate of defs 
we operate the terminal and provide propane loading services to an affiliate of defs 
the agreement  with an affiliate of defs  terminates in may  and we are currently renegotiating the agreement 
during the years ended december   and  revenues of million  million and million from an affiliate of defs  respectively  were recognized pursuant to this agreement 
other operating revenues our downstream segment also earns revenue from terminaling activities and other ancillary services associated with the transportation and storage of refined petroleum products and lpgs 
from time to time  we sell excess product inventory 
other operating revenues include revenues related to the intrastate transportation of petrochemicals under a throughput and deficiency contract 
customers our customers for the transportation of refined petroleum products include major integrated oil companies  independent oil companies  the airline industry and wholesalers 
end markets for these deliveries are primarily retail service stations  truck stops  railroads  agricultural enterprises  refineries and military and commercial jet fuel users 
propane customers include wholesalers and retailers who  in turn  sell to commercial  industrial  agricultural and residential heating customers  as well as utilities who use propane as a back up fuel source 
refineries constitute our major customers for butane and isobutane  which are used as a blend stock for gasolines and as a feed stock for alkylation units  respectively 
at december   our downstream segment had approximately customers 
during the year ended december   total revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million  of which marathon ashland petroleum llc accounted for approximately of total downstream segment revenues 
during the years ended december  and  total revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  no single customer accounted for or more of the downstream segment s revenues 
credit policies and procedures we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the years ended december  and  a few small to medium sized customers of the downstream segment filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the years ended december  and  we expensed approximately million and million  respectively  of uncollectible receivables of the downstream segment related to customer bankruptcies or other non payments 
competition the products pipeline system conducts operations without the benefit of exclusive franchises from government entities 
interstate common carrier transportation services are provided through the system pursuant to tariffs filed with the ferc 
because pipelines are generally the lowest cost method for intermediate and long haul overland movement of refined petroleum products and lpgs  the products pipeline system s most significant competitors other than indigenous production in its markets are pipelines in the areas where the products pipeline system delivers products 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges  quality of customer service and proximity to end users 
we believe our downstream segment is competitive with other 
table of contents pipelines serving the same markets  however  comparison of different pipelines is difficult due to varying product mix and operations 
trucks  barges and railroads competitively deliver products in some of the areas served by the products pipeline system 
trucking costs  however  render that mode of transportation less competitive for longer hauls or larger volumes 
barge fees for the transportation of refined products are generally lower than te products tariffs 
we face competition from rail movements of lpgs from sarnia  ontario  canada  and waterborne imports into new hampshire 
upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil operations we conduct business in our upstream segment through the following tctm and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  and our owned equity investment in seaway crude pipeline company seaway 
our upstream segment gathers  transports  markets and stores crude oil  and distributes lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
we commenced our upstream segment business in connection with the acquisition of assets from an affiliate of defs in november our upstream segment uses its asset base to aggregate crude oil and provide transportation and specialized services to its regional customers 
our upstream segment purchases crude oil from various producers and operators at the wellhead and makes bulk purchases of crude oil at pipeline and terminal facilities 
the crude oil is then sold to refiners and other customers 
the upstream segment transports crude oil through equity owned pipelines  its trucking operations and third party pipelines 
margins in the upstream segment are calculated as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
margins are a more meaningful measure of financial performance than operating revenues and operating expenses due to the significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses caused by variations in the level of marketing activity and prices for products marketed see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upstream segment for margin and volume information 
tctm purchases crude oil and simultaneously establishes a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users 
we seek to maintain a balanced marketing position until we make physical delivery of the crude oil  thereby minimizing or eliminating our exposure to price fluctuations occurring after the initial purchase 
however  certain basis risks  which are the risks that price relationships between delivery points  classes of products or delivery periods will change  cannot be completely hedged or eliminated 
risk management policies have been established by the risk management committee to monitor and control market risks

competition the most significant competitors in pipeline operations in our upstream segment are primarily common carrier and proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies  large independent pipeline companies and other companies in the areas where our pipeline systems deliver crude oil 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on posted tariffs  quality of customer service  knowledge of products and markets  and proximity to refineries and connecting pipelines 
the crude oil gathering and marketing business is characterized by thin margins and intense competition for supplies of crude oil at the wellhead 
declines in domestic crude oil production have intensified competition among gatherers and marketers 
a significant portion of the growth in our upstream segment has occurred through acquisitions of pipeline gathering systems 
our acquisitions in this segment have provided increased efficiencies for the gathering and transportation of crude oil with our existing pipeline systems as well as expansion into new market areas 
we experience competition from other gatherers and marketers in bidding for potential acquisitions 
within the past few years  the number of companies involved in the gathering of crude oil in the united states has decreased as a result of business consolidations and bankruptcies  which may decrease the number of potential acquisitions of crude gathering systems available to us 
credit policies and procedures as crude oil or lubrication oils are marketed or transported  we must determine the amount  if any  of credit to be extended to any given customer 
due to the nature of individual sales transactions  risk of non payment and non performance by customers is a major consideration in our business 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures

the val verde system consists of approximately miles of pipeline ranging in size from four inches to inches in diameter  compressor stations operating over  horsepower of compression and a large amine treating facility for the removal of carbon dioxide 
the system has a pipeline capacity of approximately one billion cubic feet of gas per day 
the val verde system gathers coal bed methane cbm from the fruitland coal formation of the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado  a long term source of natural gas supply in north america 
the basin is one of the most prolific sources of cbm and also contains significant conventional gas reserves 
the system is one of the largest cbm gathering and treating facilities in the united states  gathering cbm from more than separate wells throughout northern new mexico and southern colorado  and provides gathering and treating services pursuant to long term contracts with approximately different natural gas producers in the san juan basin 
gas transported on the val verde system is delivered to several interstate pipeline systems serving the western united states  as well as local new mexico markets 
in july  the new mexico oil conservation division approved an application for infill drilling to allow two wells per standard acre gas spacing unit in the fruitland coal formation of the san juan basin 
this approval of infill drilling will provide potential opportunities for long term growth and increased throughput on the val verde system 

table of contents on february   a lawsuit styled san juan citizens alliance et al 
v 
norton et al 
was filed against the united states department of interior and the bureau of land management blm in the us district court  district of columbia  challenging a recent decision by the blm 
in that decision  the blm adopted a resource management plan  which authorized the development of additional gas wells on public lands in northwestern new mexico 
a substantial portion of the development activity in the area that is the subject of the suit involves the infill drilling in the basin fruitland coal gas pool which covers most of the san juan basin 
we believe the blm followed the requirements of the law and reached a balanced decision in adopting the resource management plan 
however  an adverse decision could impact infill drilling activities in the san juan basin

and certain of its subsidiaries in december during the years ended december  and  no additional reserves were necessary for uncollectible receivables of the midstream segment 
competition the most significant competition for the ngl pipeline operations of our midstream segment comes primarily from proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil and gas companies or other large independent pipeline companies with contiguous operations 
the ability to compete in the ngl pipeline area is based primarily on the quality of customer service and knowledge of products and markets 
the majority of the recent growth in the midstream segment is due to the acquisition of jonah in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming and val verde in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
typically  new supplies of natural gas are necessary to offset the natural declines in production from wells connected to any gathering system 
the jonah and pinedale fields that are the focus of the jonah system in wyoming are both relatively young producing areas  characterized by long lived production profiles with many years of significant growth potential ahead 
we expect to aggressively market this system by obtaining contracts to gather additional natural gas supplies 

table of contents competition in the natural gas gathering operations of our midstream segment is based largely on reputation  efficiency  system reliability and system capacity 
key competitors in the gathering and treating segment include independent gas gatherers as well as other major integrated energy companies 
alternate gathering facilities may be available to producers served by our midstream segment  and those producers could also elect to construct proprietary gas gathering systems 
success in the gas gathering and treating business segment is based primarily on a thorough understanding of the needs of the producers served  as well as a strong commitment to providing responsive  high quality customer service 
if the production ultimately delivered to one of our gathering systems declines  revenues from such operations would also be adversely affected 
if these declines are sustained or substantial  then we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title to all of our assets 
the properties are subject to liabilities in certain cases  such as customary interests generally contracted in connection with acquisition of the properties  liens for taxes not yet due  easements  restrictions and other minor encumbrances 
we believe none of these liabilities materially affect the value of our properties or our interest in the properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled million for the year ended december  revenue generating projects include those projects which expand service into new markets or expand capacity into current markets 
capital expenditures to sustain existing operations include projects required by regulatory agencies or required life cycle replacements 
system upgrade projects improve operational efficiencies or reduce cost 
we capitalize interest costs incurred during the period that construction is in progress 
the following table identifies capital expenditures by segment for the year ended december  in millions sustaining revenue existing system capitalized generating operations upgrades interest total downstream segment midstream segment upstream segment other total revenue generating capital spending by the downstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the expansion of our pumping capacity of lpgs into the northeast markets  expansion of our north houston terminal facility  increased storage capacity at the princeton  indiana  terminal and expansion of delivery capacity at various other locations 
revenue generating capital spending by the midstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the upgrade of the jonah system and additional well connections on both the jonah and val verde systems 
revenue generating capital spending by the upstream segment totaled million and was used primarily for the expansion of our south texas system and connections to various other production facilities and pipelines 
in order to sustain existing operations  we spent million for various downstream segment pipeline projects  million for the midstream segment and million for upstream segment facilities 
an additional million was spent on system upgrade projects among all of our business segments 
we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to spend approximately million for revenue generating projects and facility improvements 
capital spending on revenue generating projects and facility improvements will include approximately million for the expansion of our downstream segment facilities including pipelines extending from seymour to indianapolis  indiana  further expansions of our northeast pipeline 
table of contents system and construction of a new truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana 
we expect to spend million to expand our upstream segment pipelines and facilities in south texas and oklahoma and approximately million to expand our midstream segment assets 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  including life cycle replacements for equipment at various facilities and pipeline and tank replacements among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business segments 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
regulation our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the provisions of the interstate commerce act  the energy policy act of and rules and orders promulgated thereunder 
ferc regulation requires that interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline rates be posted publicly and that these rates be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
rates of interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies  like us  are currently regulated by the ferc primarily through an index methodology  which allows a pipeline to change its rates based on the change from year to year in the producer price index for finished goods ppi index 
effective as of february   ferc order on remand modified the ppi index from ppi to ppi 
on april   several shippers filed a petition in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  flying j 
inc  lion oil company  sinclair oil corporation and tesoro refining and marketing company vs 
federal energy regulatory commission  docket no 
 seeking a review of whether the ferc s adoption of the ppi index was reasonable and supported by the evidence 
oral arguments are scheduled for early as an alternative to using the ppi index  interstate petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies may elect to support rate filings by using a cost of service methodology  competitive market showings market based rates or agreements between shippers and petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies that the rate is acceptable 
te products has been granted permission by the ferc to utilize market based rates for all of its refined products movements other than the little rock  arkansas  arcadia and shreveport arcadia  louisiana destination markets  which are currently subject to the ppi index 
with respect to lpg movements  te products uses the ppi index 
all interstate transportation movements of crude oil by tctm are subject to the ppi index as is the ngl interstate transportation movements on the chaparral ngl system 
in a decision involving an unrelated pipeline limited partnership  the ferc partially disallowed the inclusion of income taxes in that partnership s cost of service 
in another ferc proceeding involving a different pipeline limited partnership  the ferc held that the pipeline limited partnership may not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate limited partners 
these ferc decisions do not affect our current rates and rate structure because we do not use the cost of service methodology to support our rates 
however  the ferc decisions might become relevant to us should we i elect in the future to use the cost of service methodology or ii be required to use such methodology to defend initial rates or our indexed rates against a shipper protest alleging that an indexed rate increase substantially exceeds actual cost increases 
should these circumstances arise  there can be no assurance with respect to the effect of these precedents on our rates in view of the uncertainties involved in this issue 
the natural gas gathering operations of the jonah and val verde systems are exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of since they are intrastate gas gathering systems rather than interstate transmission pipelines 
however  ferc regulation still significantly affects the midstream segment  directly or indirectly  by its influences on the parties that produce the natural gas gathered on the jonah and val verde systems 
in addition  in recent years  ferc has pursued pro competition policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
if the ferc does not continue the pro competition policies as it considers pipeline rate case proposals  revisions to rules and policies that affect shipper rights of access to interstate natural gas transportation capacity or proposals by 
table of contents natural gas pipelines to allow natural gas pipelines to charge negotiated rates without rate ceiling limits  such policy changes could have an adverse effect on the gathering rates the midstream segment is able to charge in the future 
environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
we believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the near term 
water the federal water pollution control act of  as renamed and amended as the clean water act cwa  and analogous state laws impose strict controls against the discharge of oil and its derivatives into navigable waters 
the cwa provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removing petroleum or other hazardous substances 
state laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of a release of petroleum or its derivatives in navigable waters or into groundwater 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent a petroleum tank release from impacting navigable waters 
contamination resulting from spills or releases of petroleum products is an inherent risk within the petroleum pipeline industry 
to the extent that groundwater contamination requiring remediation exists along our pipeline systems as a result of past operations  we believe any such contamination could be controlled or remedied without having a material adverse effect on our financial position  but such costs are site specific  and we cannot assure you that the effect will not be material in the aggregate 
the primary federal law for oil spill liability is the oil pollution act of opa  which addresses three principal areas of oil pollution prevention  containment and cleanup  and liability 
opa applies to vessels  offshore platforms and onshore facilities  including terminals  pipelines and transfer facilities 
in order to handle  store or transport oil  shore facilities are required to file oil spill response plans with the appropriate federal agency being either the united states coast guard  the united states department of transportation office of pipeline safety ops or the environmental protection agency epa 
numerous states have enacted laws similar to opa 
under opa and similar state laws  responsible parties for a regulated facility from which oil is discharged may be liable for removal costs and natural resource damages 
the epa has adopted regulations that require us to have permits in order to discharge certain storm water run off 
storm water discharge permits may also be required by certain states in which we operate 
these permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water run off 
air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act the clean air act and comparable state laws 
amendments to the clean air act  as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional  non attainment areas  may require our operations to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies 
in addition  some of our facilities are included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources  which are subject to increasing regulation under the clean air act 
the clean air act requires federal operating permits for major sources of air emissions 
under this program  a federal operating permit a title v permit may 
table of contents be issued 
the permit acts as an umbrella that includes other federal  state and local preconstruction and or operating permit provisions  emission standards  grandfathered rates and record keeping  reporting and monitoring requirements in a single document 
the federal operating permit is the tool that the public and regulatory agencies use to review and enforce a site s compliance with all aspects of clean air regulation at the federal  state and local level 
we have completed applications for the facilities for which these regulations apply 
risk management plans we are subject to the epa s risk management plan rmp regulations at certain locations 
this regulation is intended to work with the occupational safety and health act osha process safety management regulation see safety matters below to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic releases 
the regulation requires a regulated source  in excess of threshold quantities  to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a five year accident history  an offsite consequence analysis  a prevention program and an emergency response program 
we believe the operating expenses of the rmp regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
solid waste we generate hazardous and non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
we also utilize waste minimization and recycling processes to reduce the volumes of our waste 
amendments to rcra required the epa to promulgate regulations banning the land disposal of all hazardous wastes unless the wastes meet certain treatment standards or the land disposal method meets certain waste containment criteria 
from time to time  the epa considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non hazardous wastes  including crude oil and gas wastes 
the adoption of such stricter standards for non hazardous wastes  or any future re designation of non hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes will likely increase our operating expenses as well as for the industry in general 
superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of a facility where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at a facility 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  our pipeline systems generate wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
in the event a disposal facility previously used by us requires clean up in the future  we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
other environmental proceedings in  the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq issued a compliance order for environmental contamination at our arcadia  louisiana  facility 
this contamination may be attributable to our operations  as well as to adjacent petroleum terminals operated by other companies 
in  our arcadia facility and adjacent terminals were directed by the remediation services division of the ldeq to pursue remediation of this contamination 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million for remediation costs at our arcadia facility 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program proposed to the ldeq will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  we were notified by the epa of potential liability for alleged waste disposal at container recycling  inc  located in kansas city  kansas 
we were also asked to respond to an epa information 
table of contents request 
our response to the information request has been filed with the epa region vii office 
based on information we have received from the epa  as well as through our internal investigations  we are pursuing dismissal from this matter 
in november  we were notified by the epa of a potential liability for alleged waste disposal at industrial pollution control located in jackson  mississippi 
based on the pro rata share of waste disposed of at the facility  the potentially responsible parties were requested to file a tolling agreement 
we filed this agreement with the epa in december our contribution of total waste disposed of at the facility was estimated to be less than  and we agreed in august to pay our pro rata share of the remediation costs which amounted to  this matter has been fully resolved with the epa  and no further action is expected 
on march   we experienced a release of barrels of jet fuel from a storage tank at our blue island terminal located in cook county  illinois 
as a result of the release  we have entered into an agreed order with the state of illinois 
the agreed order requires us  in part  to complete a site investigation plan to delineate the scope of any potential contamination resulting from the release and to remediate any contamination present above regulatory standards 
this site investigation plan has been completed and submitted to the state of illinois 
the agreed order does not contain any provision for any fines or penalties  however  it does not preclude the state of illinois from assessing these at a later date 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million related to various tctm sites requiring environmental remediation activities 
under the terms of a agreement through which we acquired various crude oil assets from dettco  we received a five year contractual indemnity obligation for environmental liabilities not otherwise assumed by us that were attributable to the operations of the assets prior to our acquisition 
the indemnity expired on november  under the agreement  we were responsible for the first million in environmental liabilities covered by dettco s indemnification obligation  and dettco was responsible for specified environmental liabilities in excess of million  up to a maximum amount of million 
at december   we had a receivable balance from dettco of million  the majority of which related to remediation activities at the velma  oklahoma crude oil site 
on march   we received a million payment from dettco for environmental liabilities we incurred that were covered under the indemnity obligation with dettco 
the remaining million due was determined as not attributable to dettco s indemnity obligation as a result of settlement discussions with dettco on this matter and was written off 
on december   concurrent with the expiration of the five year contractual indemnity obligation  we entered into a settlement agreement and release with dettco regarding future obligations pertaining to various environmental liabilities associated with the assets purchased from dettco in the agreement provided for a net payment of million to us from dettco  which consisted of a settlement of million for remaining crude oil sites  partially offset by the sharing of expenses of million which were incurred by dettco in remediation of a crude oil site in stephens county  oklahoma 
the agreement also provided for million toward the purchase of an environmental insurance policy for gathering systems located in texas and oklahoma and the assumption of responsibility by dettco for environmental liabilities associated with three sites located in texas and oklahoma 
we do not expect that the completion of remediation programs associated with tctm activities will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
dot pipeline compliance matters we are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation dot under the accountable pipeline and safety partnership act of  sometimes referred to as the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act hlpsa  and comparable state statutes relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of our pipeline facilities 
the hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations  to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
the hlpsa was reauthorized in we believe that we are in material compliance with these hlpsa regulations 

table of contents we are subject to the dot regulation requiring qualification of pipeline personnel 
the regulation requires pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities 
the intent of this regulation is to ensure a qualified work force and to reduce the probability and consequence of incidents caused by human error 
the regulation establishes qualification requirements for individuals performing covered tasks  and amends certain training requirements in existing regulations 
a written qualification program was completed in april  and our employees performing a covered task were qualified by the october deadline 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these dot regulations 
we are also subject to the ops integrity management regulations which specify how companies with greater than miles of pipeline should assess  evaluate  validate and maintain the integrity of pipeline segments that  in the event of a release  could impact high consequence areas hca 
hca are defined as highly populated areas  unusually sensitive environmental areas and commercially navigable waterways 
the regulation requires the development and implementation of an integrity management program imp that utilizes internal pipeline inspection  pressure testing  or other equally effective means to assess the integrity of hca pipeline segments 
the regulation also requires periodic review of hca pipeline segments to ensure adequate preventative and mitigative measures exist and that companies take prompt action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment and analysis 
in compliance with these ops regulations  we identified our hca pipeline segments and developed an imp by the march  deadline 
the regulations require that initial hca baseline integrity assessments must be conducted within seven years  with all subsequent assessments conducted on a five year cycle 
during  we continued with the baseline evaluation efforts initiated in and completed the evaluation and associated repair of approximately  miles of our pipeline system 
safety matters we are also subject to the requirements of the federal osha and comparable state statutes 
we believe we are in material compliance with osha and state requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposures 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations 
certain parts of this information must be reported to employees  state and local governmental authorities and local citizens upon request 
we are subject to osha process safety management psm regulations  which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic  reactive  flammable or explosive chemicals 
these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process which involves a flammable liquid or gas  as defined in the regulations  stored on site in one location  in a quantity of  pounds or more 
we utilize certain covered processes and maintain storage of lpgs in pressurized tanks  caverns and wells  in excess of  pounds at various locations 
flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt 
we believe we are in material compliance with the osha regulations 
in general  we expect to increase our expenditures during the next decade to comply with stricter industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above 
while such expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time  we do not believe that they will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
employees the partnership does not have any employees 
however  for organizational purposes  teppco gp  teppco ngl pipelines  llc and teppco crude gp  llc have officers and directors  who are employees of the general partner

our upstream segment gathers  transports  markets and stores crude oil and distributes lubrication oils and specialty chemicals in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and in the rocky mountain region 
our midstream segment gathers natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming and in the san juan basin in northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado  transports ngls from southeastern new mexico  east texas and west texas to mont belvieu  texas  and fractionates ngls at two facilities in colorado 
our downstream segment owns  operates or has investments in properties located in states and transports  stores and provides terminal facilities for petroleum products  transports lpgs in the mont belvieu area  transports petrochemicals in southeast texas  and provides other ancillary services 
we earn revenues and income and generate cash by charging our customers a fee for the transportation  storage  gathering  terminaling  fractionation and other services we provide 
in our upstream segment  we seek to maintain a balanced marketing position until we make physical delivery of the crude oil  thereby minimizing or eliminating our exposure to price fluctuations occurring after the initial purchase 
we are subject to economic and other factors that affect our industry 
the demand for crude oil and petroleum products is dependent on the price of crude oil and the products produced from the refining of crude oil  the price of natural gas and locations in which natural gas is drilled  and the demand for petrochemicals  which is dependent on prices for products produced from petrochemicals 
we are also subject to regulatory factors such as the amounts we are allowed to charge our customers for the services we provide on our regulated pipeline systems 

table of contents we are focused on opportunities  challenges and risks that are inherent in our business segments as discussed in this report 
these include the safe  reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own or operate while meeting increased regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations 
we are also focused on our continued growth through expansion of the assets that we own and through acquisition of assets that compliment the segments in which we operate 
in  excellent operating performance across all of our business segments contributed to a record year for volumes  net income and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our results illustrate the strength and diversity of our asset portfolio 
our net income for the year ended december   was million 
we raised our distribution to our unitholders by per unit to an annualized rate of per unit at year end  continuing our eleven year track record of distribution increases 
distributions have increased over the past five years 
our upstream segment had strong gathering  marketing and transportation results  including the benefits of a one time gain of million related to the sale of certain portions of the rancho pipeline 
additionally  seaway s performance was noticeably stronger  with record volumes in the second half of the year 
we also had higher throughput on our crude systems and a record year for gallons delivered by lsi 
the downstream segment had an excellent year  as well  with record refined product and propane deliveries  made possible by the additional capacity provided by our lease agreement with centennial 
we have utilized centennial capacity in a manner that has provided additional delivery capability for our customers 
the midstream segment continued its strong performance  with continued volume growth on the jonah system and full year contribution of the val verde system  acquired in june  providing a positive impact on our overall profitability 
additional revenue generating capital growth prospects make the outlook favorable for continued strong performance in this segment 
our operating costs were higher than expected  largely as a result of pipeline integrity expenses in our downstream segment 
the goal of our on going pipeline integrity program has always been to maintain the long term reliability and safety of our pipeline systems  while minimizing the impact to our customers 
we ended in a solid financial position 
during the year  we spent million on acquisitions and revenue generating capital projects  which we believe will provide earnings  cash flow and growth opportunities 
we raised approximately million in equity capital during the year to fund these revenue generating capital projects  reduce debt and for general partnership purposes 
we continued building a base for long term growth by enhancing existing systems and pursuing new business opportunities 
we increased throughput on our pipeline systems  constructed new pipeline and gathering systems  and expanded and upgraded our existing infrastructure 
among the highlights of we acquired an additional interest in centennial for million  bringing our ownership interest to 
additionally  centennial has provided additional capacity through our lease agreement that has enabled us to transport record refined product volumes in in november  we purchased miles of crude supply and transportation assets along the upper texas gulf coast from genesis crude oil  lp and genesis pipeline texas  lp the million acquisition strengthened our existing south texas market position and improved our physical asset base 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed a million expansion project that was part of a system wide effort to increase our deliverability of lpgs to the northeast markets 
in the fourth quarter of  the phase iii expansion of the jonah system became operational 
during  we spent approximately million on the project with an additional million expected to be spent in the phase iii project expands both pipeline and processing capacity on the jonah system 
the phase iii expansion provides additional investment opportunities from the ongoing development of the jonah and pinedale reserves in wyoming 
we spent an additional million on other revenue generating projects  including the expansion of downstream segment terminal storage and delivery capacity  additional well connections in the midstream segment and expansions on the upstream segment s south texas system 
we remain confident that our current strategy and focus will provide continued growth in earnings and cash distributions 
with respect to  these opportunities include 
table of contents construction of a new truck loading facility in bossier city  louisiana 
integration of the genesis crude oil assets and increased utilization of seaway 
continued development of refined products and propane market opportunities 
continued development of the jonah and pinedale fields 
infill drilling of cbm and conventional gas in the san juan basin  where our val verde system is located 
acquisitions we completed several acquisitions in  and that have impacted the results of operations and liquidity discussed in this report 
the following acquisitions were accounted for  and the purchase price was allocated  in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  in and followed the provisions of that statement for all business combinations initiated after june  jonah gas gathering company on september   we completed the purchase of jonah from alberta energy company for million  with an additional payment of million made on february   for final purchase adjustments related primarily to construction projects in progress at the time of closing 
the acquisition served as our entry into the natural gas gathering industry 
we funded the acquisition through a borrowing under a million credit facility with suntrust bank see note debt 
we allocated the purchase price  net of liabilities assumed  primarily to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for gas gathering contracts 
we also recognized goodwill on the purchase of approximately million see note acquisitions and dispositions 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from september  under a contractual agreement  defs manages and operates jonah on our behalf 
the value assigned to intangible assets relates to contracts with customers that are for either a fixed term or which dedicate total future lease production 
we are amortizing the value assigned to intangible assets on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system over the expected total throughput for the contracts averaging approximately years 
since the acquisition  we have expanded both the pipeline capacity and processing capacity of the jonah system 
in  we completed the phase i and phase ii expansions of jonah  which nearly doubled the capacity of the jonah system 
the first expansion was completed in may at a cost of approximately million and increased system capacity by  from approximately mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
in october  an additional expansion project was completed at a cost of approximately million  which increased the capacity of the jonah system from mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
in  the jonah system was again expanded to include an mile expansion on the system and the building of a new mmcf day gas processing plant near opal  wyoming 
phase iii was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of  and the system was operational  with system capacity increasing to  mmcf day 
the cost of the phase iii expansion through december   was approximately million 
the total cost of the phase iii expansion will be approximately million  with the remaining work to be completed in chaparral ngl system on march   we completed the purchase of the chaparral ngl system for million from diamond koch ii  lp and diamond koch iii  lp  including acquisition related costs of approximately million 
the chaparral ngl system extends from west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu 
the pipeline delivers ngls to fractionators and to mb storage s existing storage facilities in mont belvieu 
we funded the purchase through borrowings under our million revolving credit facility see note debt 
we allocated the purchase price to property  plant and equipment 
accordingly  the results of the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from march  under a contractual agreement  defs manages and operates chaparral on our behalf 

table of contents val verde gas gathering company on june   we completed the purchase of val verde for million from burlington resources gathering inc  a subsidiary of burlington resources inc  including acquisition related costs of approximately million 
the val verde system gathers cbm from the fruitland coal formation of the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
the system is one of the largest cbm gathering and treating facilities in the united states 
we funded the purchase through borrowings of million under our million revolving credit facility  million under our day revolving credit facility and million under a six month term loan with suntrust bank see note debt 
the remaining purchase price was funded through working capital sources of cash 
we allocated the purchase price  net of liabilities assumed  primarily to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for gas gathering contracts see note acquisitions and dispositions

the value assigned to intangible assets relates to fixed term contracts with customers 
we are amortizing the value assigned to intangible assets on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system over the expected total throughput for the contracts averaging approximately years 
rancho pipeline in connection with our acquisition of crude oil assets in  we acquired an approximate undivided joint interest in the rancho pipeline  which was a crude oil pipeline system from west texas to houston 
in march  the rancho pipeline ceased operations  and segments of the pipeline were sold to certain of the owners which previously held undivided interests in the pipeline 
we acquired approximately miles of the pipeline in exchange for cash of million and our interests in other portions of the rancho pipeline 
we sold part of the segment we acquired to other entities for cash and assets valued at approximately million 
we recorded a net gain of million on the transactions  which is included in the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statements of income 
genesis pipeline on november   we completed the purchase of crude supply and transportation assets along the upper texas gulf coast for million from genesis crude oil  lp and genesis pipeline texas  lp the transaction was funded with proceeds from our august equity offering see note partners capital and distributions 
we allocated the purchase price  net of liabilities assumed  primarily to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets see note acquisitions and dispositions 
the assets acquired included approximately miles of small diameter trunk lines   barrels per day of throughput and  barrels per day of lease marketing and supply business 
we have integrated these assets into our south texas pipeline system which has allowed us to consolidate gathering and marketing assets in key operating areas in a cost effective manner and will provide future growth opportunities 
accordingly  the results of the acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements from november  general we operate and report in three business segments downstream segment transportation and storage of refined products  lpgs and petrochemicals  upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  and midstream segment gathering of natural gas  transportation of ngls and fractionation of ngls 

table of contents our reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
teppco gp  our wholly owned subsidiary  acts as managing general partner of our operating partnerships  with a general partner interest and manages our subsidiaries 
effective january   we realigned our three business segments to reflect our entry into the natural gas gathering business and the expanded scope of ngls operations 
we transferred the fractionation of ngls  which was previously reflected as part of the downstream segment  to the midstream segment 
the operation of the ngl pipelines  which was previously reflected as part of the upstream segment  was also transferred to the midstream segment 
we have adjusted our period to period comparisons to conform with the current presentation 
our downstream segment revenues are earned from transportation and storage of refined products and lpgs  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment are labor and electric power 
we generally realize higher revenues during the first and fourth quarters of each year since our operations are somewhat seasonal 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
our downstream segment also includes the results of operations of the northern portion of the dean pipeline 
beginning in january  the northern portion of the dean pipeline was converted to transport rgp from mont belvieu to point comfort  texas 
as a result  the revenues and expenses of the northern portion of the dean pipeline are included in the downstream segment 
our downstream segment also includes our equity investments in centennial and mb storage see note equity investments 
our upstream segment revenues are earned from gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas  new mexico and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating purchased crude oil along our pipeline systems  or from third party pipeline systems  and arranging the necessary transportation logistics for the ultimate sale of the crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
our upstream segment also includes our equity investment in seaway see note equity investments 
our midstream segment revenues are earned from the fractionation of ngls in colorado  transportation of ngls from two trunkline ngl pipelines in south texas  two ngl pipelines in east texas and a pipeline system chaparral from west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu  the gathering of natural gas in the green river basin in southwestern wyoming  through jonah  and the gathering of cbm in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado  through val verde 
defs manages and operates the val verde  jonah and chaparral assets for us under contractual agreements 
the results of operations of the acquisitions are included in our consolidated financial statements in periods subsequent to their respective acquisition dates see note acquisitions and dispositions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although we believe that these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
key estimates used by our management include estimates used to record revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting 
table of contents policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  property  plant and equipment and goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses due to the timing of compiling billing information  receiving certain third party information and reconciling our records with those of third parties 
the delayed information from third parties includes  among other things  actual volumes of crude oil purchased  transported or sold  adjustments to inventory and invoices for purchases and other operating expenses 
we make accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
most of the estimated accruals are reversed in the following month when actual information is received from third parties and our internal records have been reconciled 
the most difficult accruals to estimate are power costs  property taxes and crude oil margins 
power cost accruals generally involve a two to three month estimate  and the amount varies primarily for actual power usage 
power costs are dependent upon the actual volumes transported through our pipeline systems and the various power rates charged by numerous power companies along the pipeline system 
peak demand rates  which are difficult to predict  drive the variability of the power costs 
property tax accruals involve significant tax rate estimates among numerous jurisdictions 
actual property taxes are often not known until the tax bill is settled in subsequent periods  and the tax amount can vary for tax rate changes and changes in tax methods or elections 
crude oil margin estimates are based upon an average of the past twelve months of crude oil marketing volumes  factoring in current market events  and prices of crude oil 
we use an average of prices that were in effect during the applicable month to determine the expected revenue amount  and we determine the margin by evaluating the actual margins of the prior twelve months 
each of these accruals requires management s subjective judgments  requiring estimates regarding the effects of items that are inherently uncertain 
environmental costs at december   we have accrued a liability for our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites  costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs  as well as damages and other costs  when estimable 
we monitor the balance of accrued undiscounted environmental liabilities on a regular basis 
we record liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site when our liability for such costs is probable and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded  from time to time  to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of our ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
for information concerning environmental regulation and environmental costs and contingencies  see items and business and properties environmental matters 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at its acquisition cost 
additions to property  plant and equipment  including major replacements or betterments  are recorded at cost 
we charge replacements and renewals of minor items of property that do not materially increase values or extend useful lives to maintenance expense 
the cost of property  plant and equipment  less estimated salvage value  is generally depreciated on a straight line basis using rates based upon expected useful lives of various classes of assets ranging from to per year 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
changes in useful lives that do not result in the impairment of an asset are recognized prospectively 
we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of 
table of contents the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the second quarter of  pennzoil quaker state company pennzoil sold its shreveport  louisiana  refinery 
under its transportation agreement with te products  pennzoil had a throughput commitment of  barrels per day 
pennzoil and te products negotiated a settlement of million to terminate the long term transportation agreement from the shreveport origin point on the products pipeline system 
the termination payment was recorded as refined products transportation revenue in in connection with the termination of the transportation agreement  we evaluated its impact on the pipeline segment from shreveport to el dorado  arkansas  in accordance with sfas the evaluation did not result in an impairment of the carrying value of the related transportation assets  which was million at december  we are pursuing a plan to make system changes to allow for bi directional product flow and deliveries into the shreveport market area 
we have completed feasibility studies  and we are in discussions with potential customers regarding the transportation of volumes through this pipeline 
we have approved a project for construction of a new truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana  and the reversal of the pipeline 
engineering design work and property acquisition for the terminal site are currently under way  and the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of if the successful completion of the plan is not realized on this pipeline segment  an impairment may be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over discounted future net cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining useful lives can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of fair value to carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under sfas requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
based on our assessment  we do not believe our goodwill is impaired and we have not recorded a charge from the adoption of sfas see note goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the recorded value of goodwill was million 
at december   we have million of intangible assets related to natural gas transportation contracts which were recorded as part of our acquisitions of jonah on september   and val verde on june  see note acquisitions and dispositions 
the value assigned to the natural gas transportation contracts required management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the assets acquired 
in connection with the acquisition of jonah  we assumed contracts that dedicate future production from natural gas wells in the green river basin in wyoming 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these production contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of closing 
in connection with the acquisition of val verde  we assumed fixed term gas transportation contracts with customers in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these fixed term contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the closing 
the value assigned to intangible assets is amortized on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system over the expected total throughput for the lives of the contracts 
the amortization of the jonah and val verde systems are expected to average approximately years and years  respectively 
on a quarterly basis  we update throughput estimates and evaluate the remaining expected useful life of the contract assets based upon the best available information 
changes in the estimated remaining production will impact the timing of amortization expense reported for future periods

table of contents excludes million received from pennzoil in for canceled transportation agreement discussed below 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our downstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest increased million primarily due to an increase of million in operating revenues and increased income of million from equity investments  partially offset by an increase of million in costs and expenses and a decrease of million in other income net 
we discuss factors influencing our operating performance below 
revenues from refined products transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to an overall increase of in the refined products volumes delivered 
this increase was primarily due to deliveries of products received into our pipeline from centennial at creal springs  illinois 
centennial  which began operations in april  has provided our system with additional pipeline capacity for products originating in the us gulf coast area 
in february  we entered into a lease agreement with centennial that increased our capacity to deliver refined products to our market areas 
prior to the lease agreement with centennial  deliveries on our pipeline system were based upon a proration policy  which limited customer transportation 
during  with the expanded capacity through our lease agreement with centennial  our pipeline system was not prorated during portions of and was better able to serve markets which increased transportation on our system 
in addition  in december  we raised the operating pressure of our chicago lateral pipeline which resulted in an increase in capacity for deliveries into the indianapolis and chicago markets 
with this incremental pipeline capacity  our previously constrained system has expanded deliveries in markets both south and north of creal springs 
volume increases were due to increased demand and market share for products supplied from the us gulf coast into midwest markets 
the refined products average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period primarily due higher market based tariff rates which went into effect in july  partially offset by the impact of the midwest origin point for barrels received from centennial  which resulted in an increase in short haul barrels transported on our system 
revenues from lpgs transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to colder than normal weather during the first quarter of and due to low inventories at competing supply locations during the second and third quarters of the us gulf coast had higher propane inventory during as compared to the previous year because of higher than normal foreign propane imports at mont belvieu  which resulted in a lower propane price in this market area 
this lower price contributed to increased transportation deliveries to the mid continent market areas 
additional pipeline capacity for expanded propane movements was available due to a shift of refined product volumes to centennial 
butane deliveries also increased due to the increased demand by refineries for normal butane for use in gasoline blending and increased isobutane deliveries to chicago area refineries 
the lpgs average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period as a result of an increased percentage of long haul deliveries during the year ended december   and an increase in lpg tariff rates  which went into effect in july effective january   te products ownership interest in mb storage is accounted for as an equity investment 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations totaled million for the year ended december  as a result of the formation of mb storage  revenues and expenses related to mont belvieu operations are now recorded within equity earnings 
see discussion regarding changes in equity earnings losses below 
other operating revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to the addition of the northern portion of the dean pipeline to the downstream segment in january  which increased other operating revenues by million as the pipeline began transporting rgp in january the increase was also due to higher propane deliveries at our providence  rhode island import facility and higher refined product loading fees 
these increases were partially offset by lower 
table of contents revenues from product location exchanges which are used to position product in the midwest market area and lower volume of product inventory sales 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase was made up of a million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses and a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a million decrease in taxes other than income taxes and a million decrease in operating fuel and power 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher pipeline maintenance expenses  due in part to pipeline rehabilitation expenses associated with our integrity management program  increased consulting and contract services  increased labor costs primarily due to an increase in the number of employees between years  increased insurance expense  expense from the centennial pipeline capacity lease agreement that we entered into in and the write off of receivables of million related to customer bankruptcies or other customer non payments 
the addition of the northern portion of the dean pipeline to the downstream segment increased operating  general and administrative expense by million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from the prior year period because of assets placed in service during the year  which resulted in increased depreciation expense 
in addition  we wrote off assets taken out of service during the period to depreciation expense  which also increased depreciation expense 
these increases in depreciation expense were partially offset by lower depreciation expense from assets retired during the year  which reduced the asset base  and due to the transfer of assets to mb storage 
taxes other than income taxes decreased as a result of actual property taxes being lower than previously estimated and due to the transfer of assets to mb storage 
operating fuel and power expense decreased as a result of lower power costs due to a slight decrease in the price of natural gas  partially offset by increased mainline throughput 
net losses from equity investments decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  on february   te products acquired an additional interest in centennial  bringing its ownership interest to 
centennial  which commenced operations in april  accounted for million of the equity losses for the year ended december   resulting in an increase of million in equity losses as compared with the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized increased equity losses from our investment in centennial due to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in february in april  we entered into a pipeline capacity lease with centennial for a period of five years in order to expand our capacity to deliver refined products to our market areas 
the losses from centennial are partially offset by equity earnings of million from our equity ownership interest in mb storage  which was formed effective january  amounts in the prior year period related to mont belvieu operations which were recorded to revenues and costs and expenses are now being recorded within equity earnings based upon our ownership interest in mb storage  effective with its formation on january  if the revenues and costs and expenses from the mont belvieu operations had been accounted for under the same method as in  equity earnings from mb storage would have increased million in  compared with the prior year  due to increased shuttle deliveries and increased storage revenue  partially offset by increases in depreciation expense and rehabilitation expenses on mb storage assets 
other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
the downstream segment is dependent in large part on the demand for refined petroleum products in the markets served by its pipelines 
reductions in that demand adversely affect the pipeline business of the downstream segment 
market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the refined products shipped in the downstream segment 
demand for gasoline  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one half of the downstream segment s refined products transportation revenues  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served in the downstream segment 
demand for distillates is affected by truck and railroad freight  the price of natural gas used by utilities  which use distillates as a substitute for natural gas when the price of natural gas is high  and usage for agricultural operations  which is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one quarter of the downstream segment s refined products revenues  depends on prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
propane deliveries are generally sensitive to the weather and meaningful year to year variances have occurred in the past and will likely continue to occur in the future 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  our downstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest decreased million primarily due to a decrease of million in operating revenues  an increase of million in costs and expenses  additional losses of million from equity investments and a decrease of million in other income net 
we discuss factors influencing our operating performance below 
revenues from refined products transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to million of revenue recognized in from a cash settlement received from a canceled transportation agreement with pennzoil and the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the approval of market based rates during the second quarter of see further discussion regarding these factors included in other considerations 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in refined products volumes delivered during the year ended december   primarily due to barrels received into our pipeline from centennial at creal springs  illinois 
centennial commenced refined products deliveries to us beginning in april the overall increase in refined products deliveries was partially offset by a million barrel decrease in methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe deliveries as a result of the expiration of contract deliveries to our marine terminal near beaumont effective april as a result of the contract expiration  we no longer transport mtbe through our products pipeline system 
the refined products average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year due to the impact of the midwest origin point for volumes received from centennial  which was partially offset by decreased short haul mtbe volumes delivered and higher market based tariff rates  which went into effect in july revenues from lpgs transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to decreased deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of the decrease was also due to lower prices from competing canadian and mid continent propane supply as compared to propane originating from the gulf coast 
total lpgs volumes delivered increased as a result of increased short haul deliveries to a petrochemical facility on the upper texas gulf coast 
the lpgs average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year as a result of a decreased percentage of long haul deliveries during the year ended december  revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as a result of increased storage revenue and receipt revenue 
mont belvieu shuttle volumes delivered increased during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased petrochemical demand 
the mont belvieu average rate per barrel decreased during the year ended december   as a result of increased contract shuttle deliveries  which generally carry lower rates 
other operating revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower propane deliveries from our providence import facility  lower refined products storage revenue  lower margins on product inventory sales and lower revenues from product location exchanges which are used to position product in the midwest market area 
these decreases were partially offset by increased refined products and lpgs loading fees 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase was comprised of an million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a million increase in taxes other than income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in operating fuel and power expense 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher pipeline rehabilitation expenses associated with our integrity management program  increased consulting and contract services  increased labor costs and increased general and administrative supplies expense 
depreciation expense increased from the prior year because of assets placed in service during taxes other than income taxes increased as a result of a higher property base in operating fuel and power expense decreased as a result of decreased long haul volumes delivered related to midwest volumes received from centennial and lower power costs 

table of contents net losses from equity investments increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to pre operating expenses and start up costs of centennial  which commenced operations in early april other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
upstream segment information presented in the following table includes the margin of the upstream segment  which may be viewed as a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measure under the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
we calculate the margin of the upstream segment as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
we believe that margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than operating revenues and operating expenses due to the significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses caused by variations in the level of marketing activity and prices for products marketed

we discuss factors influencing our operating performance below 
our margin increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to increased revenues on our red river  basin  south texas and west texas systems resulting from a increase in transportation volumes on these systems partially due to the acquisition of the genesis assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of crude supply and transportation assets genesis  which was integrated into our south texas system 
the acquisition of the genesis assets increased our transportation and marketing margins by approximately million and the barrels transported and marketed by approximately million barrels during lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased sales of chemical volumes  higher margins on lubrication sales and increased volumes related to the acquisition of a lubrication oil distributor in abilene  texas  in december crude oil marketing margin decreased million primarily due to an invoicing settlement on a marketing contract in the first quarter of  partially offset by increased volumes marketed  renegotiated supply contracts  lower trucking expenses and more favorable crude oil price differentials

costs and expenses excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  operating  general and administrative expenses increased million from the prior year period 
the increase includes a million increase in environmental assessment and remediation costs in  higher legal costs related to the litigation and settlement with drd and other legal costs see note commitments and contingencies  million of expense from the net settlement of crude oil imbalances with customers  higher pipeline rehabilitation expenses associated with our integrity management program and increased labor costs due to an increase in the number of employees between periods  partially offset by lower general and administrative supplies expenses during the period 
in addition  the acquisition of the genesis assets and integration into our south texas system during the fourth quarter increased operating  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
operating fuel and power increased million due to higher power costs and higher volumes in depreciation and amortization expense increased million due to assets placed in service in and and due to asset retirements 
taxes other than income taxes increased million due to slight increases in property tax accruals 
equity earnings from our investment in seaway increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to a favorable crude oil imbalance settlement  a gain on the sale of inventory  lower general and administrative expenses and higher long haul transportation volumes  partially offset by our portion of equity earnings which decreased from to on a pro rated basis in averaging approximately for the year ended december   to in in june  we recorded a net gain of million  included in the gain on sale of assets in our consolidated statements of income  on the sale of certain of the assets of the rancho pipeline 
in connection with our acquisition of crude oil assets in  we acquired an approximate undivided joint interest in the rancho pipeline  which was a crude oil pipeline system from west texas to houston 
in march  the rancho pipeline ceased operations  and segments of the pipeline were sold to certain of the current owners of the rancho pipeline 
we acquired approximately miles of the pipeline in exchange for cash of million and our interests in other portions of the rancho pipeline 
we sold part of the segment we acquired to other entities for cash and assets valued at approximately million

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in other operating revenues 
we discuss factors influencing our operating performance below 
our margin increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to volumes transported on the pipeline assets acquired from valero in march and higher revenues on our basin  red river and west texas systems 
crude oil terminaling margin remained constant between years as a result of higher volumes at midland and our red river system  offset by lower volumes at cushing and on our basin system 
lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased volumes related to the acquisition of a lubrication oil distributor in amarillo  texas  in the fourth quarter of crude oil marketing margin increased million primarily due to increased volumes marketed  renegotiated supply contracts and lower trucking expenses 
other operating revenues of the upstream segment decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower revenues from documentation and other services to support customers trading activity at midland and cushing 
costs and expenses excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  operating  general and administrative expenses decreased million from the prior year due to million of environmental costs recognized in and decreased labor related costs  partially offset by increased general and administrative supplies and services expense and environmental costs recognized in see note commitments and contingencies

taxes other than income taxes decreased million due to reductions in property tax accruals 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in operating fuel and power costs attributed to higher transportation volumes 
equity earnings from our investment in seaway for the year ended december   increased million from the year ended december   due to higher third party transportation volumes 
this increase was partially offset by our portion of equity earnings being reduced from to on a pro rated basis in averaging approximately for the year ended december  
equity earnings from our investment in seaway were affected in as a result of the reduction of the sharing percentages of tctm under the seaway partnership agreement

we discuss factors influencing our operating performance below 
revenues from the gathering of natural gas increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  natural gas gathering revenues from the jonah system increased million and volumes delivered increased bcf for the year ended december   due to the expansions of the jonah system during the first expansion  which was completed in may  increased the capacity of the jonah system by  from approximately mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
in october  additional expansion projects were completed  which increased the capacity of the jonah system from mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
a phase iii expansion was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of and increased system capacity to  mmcf day 
the increase in jonah s revenues is also partially due to an increase in the average natural gas gathering rate due to certain volume thresholds being exceeded 
natural gas gathering revenues from the val verde system increased million and volumes delivered increased bcf for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of the val verde system on june  volumes delivered for the first half of were approximately bcf 
as val verde was acquired on june   there were no comparable volumes for the first half of volumes delivered during the second half of as compared to the second half of declined approximately bcf 
this decrease in volumes during the second half of was due to the natural decline of cbm production  which resulted in decreased revenues  partially offset by an increase in the average natural gas gathering rate due to annual fee escalations in gathering agreements and higher carbon dioxide treating fees as a result of increasing carbon dioxide content in the natural gas 

table of contents revenues from the transportation of ngls increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million related to the acquisition of chaparral on march   million due to an increase in volumes transported on chaparral and million due to an increase in volumes transported on the wilcox pipeline 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million due to lower transportation volumes on the panola pipeline as a result of lower ngl volumes available from the connected ngl plants and a decrease of million on the southern portion of the dean pipeline due to decreased transportation volumes 
lower transportation volumes on the southern portion of the dean pipeline resulted from the conversion of the northern portion of the pipeline to transport rgp and subsequent classification as a part of the downstream segment  effective january  the decrease in the ngl transportation average rate per barrel resulted from a lower average rate per barrel on volumes transported on chaparral

these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in amortization expense on val verde s intangible assets under the units of production method as volumes gathered decreased between periods 
in addition  amortization expense on jonah decreased million related to its intangible assets 
in second quarter  jonah s estimated total throughput of the system was adjusted  which resulted in an extension of the expected amortization period from years to years see note goodwill and other intangible assets

the remaining amount was used primarily to fund revenue generating and system upgrade capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes 
general partner interest as of december   we had a deficit balance of million in our general partner s equity account 
this negative balance does not represent an asset to us and does not represent an obligation of the general partner to contribute cash or other property to us 
the general partner s equity account consists of its cumulative share of our net income and cash distributions that we made and capital contributions that it has made to us see our consolidated statements of partners capital for a detail of the general partner s equity account 
for the year ended december   the general partner was allocated million representing of our net income and received million in cash distributions 
capital accounts  as defined under our partnership agreement  are maintained for our general partner and our limited partners 
the capital account provisions of our partnership agreement incorporate principles established for us federal income tax purposes and are not comparable to the equity accounts reflected under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in our financial statements 
under our partnership agreement  the general partner is only required to make additional capital contributions to us upon the issuance of any additional limited partner units and only if necessary to maintain a capital account balance equal to of the total capital accounts of all partners 
at december   the general partner s capital account balance substantially exceeded this requirement 
net income is allocated between the general partner and the limited partners in the same proportion as aggregate cash distributions made to the general partner and the limited partners during the period 
this is generally consistent with the manner of allocating net income under our partnership agreement 
net income determined under our partnership agreement  however  incorporates principles established for us federal income tax purposes and is not comparable to net income reflected under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in our financial statements 
cash distributions that we make during a period may exceed our net income for the period 
we make quarterly cash distributions of all of our available cash  generally defined as consolidated cash receipts less consolidated cash disbursements and cash reserves established by the general partner in its sole discretion see note partners capital and distributions 
cash distributions in excess of net income allocations and capital contributions during the year ended december   resulted in a deficit in the general partner s equity account at december  future cash distributions which exceed net income will result in an increase in the deficit balance in the general partner s equity account 

table of contents according to the partnership agreement  in the event of our dissolution  after satisfying our liabilities  our remaining assets would be divided among our limited partners and the general partner generally in the same proportion as available cash but calculated on a cumulative basis over the life of the partnership 
after all allocations are made between the partners  if a deficit balance in its equity account still remains for the general partner  the general partner would not be required to make whole any such deficit 
future capital needs and commitments we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to spend approximately million for revenue generating projects and facility improvements 
capital spending on revenue generating projects and facility improvements will include approximately million for the expansion of our downstream segment facilities including pipelines extending from seymour to indianapolis  indiana  further expansions of our northeast pipeline system and construction of a new truck loading terminal in bossier city  louisiana 
we expect to spend million to expand our upstream segment pipelines and facilities in south texas and oklahoma and approximately million to expand our midstream segment assets 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  including life cycle replacements for equipment at various facilities and pipeline and tank replacements among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business segments

environmental our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us

we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our cash flow and fair value risks 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and overall cost of borrowing
