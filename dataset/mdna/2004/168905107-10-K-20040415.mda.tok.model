asset impairment charges represent the write down of fixed assets in under performing stores to fair value 
we wrote down assets in one store in fiscal and stores in fiscal we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
for purposes of determining the comparable store sales increase  average net sales per store and average net sales per gross square foot  fiscal results were recalculated based on a week year 
average net sales per store represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the number of such stores 
average square footage per store represents the square footage of stores open on the last day of the period divided by the number of such stores 
average net sales per gross square foot represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the gross square footage of such stores 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in item the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc is a specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for children from newborn to ten years of age 
as of april   we operated stores in the united states and canada 
we also sell our merchandise on the internet 
we believe that our merchandise assortment appeals to customers across a broad range of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds 
we control the design  sourcing and presentation of our products  all of which are marketed under our proprietary brand name 
we believe that our integrated merchandise approach  from in house design to in store presentation  enables us to quickly identify and respond to market trends  uphold rigorous product quality standards  manage the cost of our merchandise and strengthen our brand name 
in addition  we have established long standing relationships with our trading company  buying agents  vendors and suppliers 
net sales in fiscal were million  compared to net sales of million reported in fiscal during fiscal  we reported a comparable store sales increase of compared to a decline in fiscal net income in fiscal  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal our improved financial performance in fiscal reflected the success of several strategic initiatives we implemented to address the challenges we faced in fiscal we reduced both the number of styles and number of items within our stores to provide our customers with a clear and focused product assortment 
we also offered a greater percentage of basic items  in an effort to create a better balance between our fashion and basic merchandise 
in addition  we improved our garment quality and reduced our prices to an everyday value pricing strategy 
during fiscal  we plan to build on our progress through the consistent fashion  quality and value of our merchandise 
in addition  we are focused on improving store productivity by enhancing our overall shopping experience by strengthening our marketing and store visual presentation and various customer service initiatives 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  which included stores in the united states and stores in canada  as compared to the opening of new stores in fiscal our store growth plan in includes opening approximately stores  in the united states  in canada and seven in puerto rico  which is a new market for the company 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million before taxes for the writedown of leasehold improvements and fixtures in one underperforming store 
this compares to a writedown of million before taxes incurred in fiscal related to underperforming stores 
impairment charges were recorded because the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
during  we closed five stores  of which three stores had been identified as impaired in fiscal during fiscal  we closed three stores 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate decreased to from in fiscal as a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance on losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary in fiscal we did not recognize a tax benefit on losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary in fiscal we anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase during fiscal to approximately 
during the nine week period ended april   we reported total sales of million  a increase compared to sales of million during the nine week period ended april  our comparable store sales increased by during the nine weeks ended april   compared to a decrease in comparable store sales during the corresponding nine week period last year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped from our distribution center if the product was purchased via the internet  net of anticipated returns 
actual merchandise return rates have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
however  in the unlikely event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as the gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to their redemption  gift cards are recorded as a liability 
once an annual minimum customer purchase threshold is satisfied on our private label credit card  we offer a discount on future purchases for the remainder of the fiscal year 
revenue is deferred for the future discount earned by our private label credit card customers that have satisfied or are expected to satisfy minimum purchase thresholds 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market  using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to our best estimate of their fair market value 
we base our decision to mark down merchandise upon its current rate of sale  the season  and the age and sell through of the item 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion taste of our customers and provide a well balanced merchandise assortment that satisfies customer demand 
any inability to provide the proper quantity of appropriate merchandise in a timely manner could increase future markdown rates 
impairment of assets we continually evaluate each store s performance and measure the carrying value of each location s fixed assets  principally leasehold improvements and fixtures  versus its projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recorded if the projected future cash flows are insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
to the extent our estimates of future cash flows are incorrect  additional impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
in our opinion  any ultimate liability arising out of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
stock options we record no compensation expense on our financial statements for stock based compensation  since we grant stock options at prices that equal or exceed the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant 
if  in the future  we elect or are required to adopt fair value accounting for our stock based compensation  the related compensation charge will adversely impact net income 
in addition  increases to our stock price would result in more diluted shares outstanding and reduce our diluted net income per common share 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income number of stores  end of period year ended january  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores 
net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of our net sales increase 
our comparable store sales increased and contributed million of our net sales increase 
comparable store sales decreased during fiscal our comparable store sales increase in fiscal reflected the impact of strategic initiatives we commenced in fiscal to improve our sales performance 
these initiatives included a more focused product offering with a greater concentration of basic merchandise  as well as improved garment quality and the reduction of our prices to an everyday value pricing strategy 
during fiscal  our comparable store sales increase was primarily the result of increases in the number of comparable store sales transactions  partially offset by decreases in our average dollar transaction size 
gross profit increased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to during fiscal from during fiscal during fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased due to lower markdowns and the leveraging of occupancy  production and design costs over a larger sales base  partially offset by a lower initial markup due to our strategic decision to lower prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales during fiscal  as compared with of net sales during fiscal the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to higher marketing costs  higher store payroll and lower insurance proceeds  partially offset by lower pre opening costs 
during fiscal  we increased our marketing efforts to promote brand awareness and to drive sales 
to improve customer service  our store payroll hours were increased to provide more sales assistance 
during fiscal  insurance proceeds approximated million  or of net sales  resulting primarily from partial settlement of our claim from our world trade center store

during fiscal  we closed five stores  of which three stores had been identified as impaired during fiscal depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of a larger store base 
depreciation and amortization decreased  as a percentage of net sales  as a result of the leveraging of the expense over a larger sales base 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the increase in our tax provision was primarily due to our increased profitability in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal primarily as a result of the reversal of a million valuation allowance on losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary in fiscal we did not recognize a tax benefit for our canadian losses in fiscal due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal year ended february  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of the net sales increase 
this net sales increase was partially offset by a comparable store sales decline in fiscal  which decreased our net sales by million 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal during fiscal  our comparable store sales decline resulted from a merchandise mix that was too heavily weighted towards fashion and contained an over assortment of styles and low inventory levels partially caused by late deliveries 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the west coast ports labor dispute also contributed to delivery delays of our holiday lines 
these shipment delays resulted in a disjointed store presentation and adversely impacted the customers ability to purchase a coordinated outfit 
our comparable store sales decline was also unfavorably impacted by a slowdown in store traffic that was caused in part by the difficult economic climate 
as a result  we experienced a lower average dollar transaction size and a lower number of comparable store sales transactions compared to fiscal in addition  our average retail price was lower as a result of aggressive markdowns taken throughout fiscal  as well as our strategic decision to lower prices in order to be more competitive during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gross profit decreased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal during fiscal  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased due to higher occupancy costs and higher markdowns taken to clear merchandise  partially offset by higher initial markup achieved through lower product costs from our manufacturers 
occupancy costs were higher  as a percentage of net sales  due to our comparable store sales decline and increased occupancy costs from new stores that have not been open long enough to leverage their rent through an established sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales during fiscal  as compared with of net sales during fiscal the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to higher store payroll  marketing  medical benefit and insurance costs  partially offset by insurance proceeds 
these insurance proceeds approximated million  or of net sales  and resulted primarily from the partial settlement of our claim from our world trade center store and a property damage claim from one of our distribution centers 
during fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million before taxes  or of net sales  for the write down of leasehold improvements and fixtures in underperforming stores 
we determined these assets were impaired as the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of our larger store base and increased software amortization  due to a full year of amortization on systems implemented in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded net interest income of million  or of net sales  due to our net cash investment position 
during fiscal  we recorded net interest expense of million  due to borrowings under our working capital facility 
our provision for taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the decrease in our tax provision was primarily due to our decreased profitability in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal increased as a result of losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary for which we did not recognize a tax benefit 
due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal liquidity and capital resources debt service liquidity our primary uses of cash are financing new store openings and providing for working capital  which primarily represents the purchase of inventory 
our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern  peaking during the second and third quarters when inventory is purchased for the back to school and holiday seasons 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of january   we had no long term debt obligations nor any borrowings on our credit facilities 
we have a credit facility the wells fargo credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc wells fargo 
the wells fargo credit facility currently provides for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million 
the wells fargo credit facility also contains provisions to allow us to increase borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million  subject to sufficient collateralization and the syndication of the incremental line of borrowing 
the amount that may be borrowed under the wells fargo credit facility depends on our levels of inventory and accounts receivable 
amounts outstanding under the facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at our option  a libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
the libor spread is to  depending on our level of availability from time to time 
the wells fargo credit facility contains covenants  which include  limitations on our annual capital expenditures  the maintenance of certain levels of excess collateral and a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
credit extended under the wells fargo credit facility is secured by a first priority security interest in all our assets  except for our assets in canada 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the wells fargo credit facility as of january  noncompliance with these covenants could result in additional fees or could affect our ability to borrow 
as of january  and february   there were no borrowings under the wells fargo credit facility and letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility were million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  our borrowings under the wells fargo credit facility represented overnight borrowings for letters of credit that cleared after business hours 
the maximum outstanding letter of credit usage during fiscal was million and the maximum balance outstanding for overnight letter of credit borrowings was million 
availability under the wells fargo credit facility as of january  and february  was million and million  respectively 
the interest rates charged under the wells fargo credit facility were and per annum as of january  and february   respectively 
to support our canadian operations  we have a million credit facility with toronto dominion bank  which  as of january   was collateralized by a standby letter of credit to provide for million in borrowings 
as of february   our canadian credit facility was collateralized to provide million in borrowings 
as of january   we had no borrowings under our canadian credit facility and had no outstanding letters of credit 
the maximum outstanding balance on our canadian credit facility was million during fiscal availability under our canadian credit facility was million and million as of january  and february   respectively 
interest rates charged under the canadian credit facility were and as of january  and february   respectively 
cash flows capital expenditures cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities increased primarily as a result of higher operating earnings and lower income tax payments resulting from prior year tax prepayments 
in addition  accounts receivable was lower primarily as a result of lower construction allowances due to fewer store openings in fiscal these increases in cash flow were partially offset by higher inventory levels 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities decreased primarily as a result of lower operating earnings  higher inventory levels and increases in current assets  partially offset by increases in current liabilities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to store openings and remodelings 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we opened  and stores while remodeling  and stores  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal also included million in capital expenditures related to a new distribution center to support our canadian operations 
in october  we entered into a year lease  with two five year renewal option periods  for an approximately  square foot distribution center in mississauga  ontario to replace our existing canadian distribution center  which is about  square feet 
the new facility is being built by our current landlord  who has agreed to release us from our obligations under the existing lease once the new facility is available for use  which we anticipate will be in the second quarter of fiscal annual rent for this facility approximates million 
during fiscal  we expect to make an additional cash outlay of approximately million to equip this facility  which will include automated warehouse handling equipment 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflecting funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities was million and reflected the net repayment of borrowings under our working capital facility  offset partially by funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures for our business will approximate million in fiscal these expenditures will relate primarily to the opening of approximately stores  plus store remodels 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
our ability to meet our capital requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations 
in addition  we may consider additional sources of financing to fund our long term growth 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations as of january  contractual obligations dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases employment contracts other commercial commitments dollars in thousands total amounts committed amounts of commitment expiration per period less than year years years after years working capital facility purchase commitments merchandise letters of credit standby letters of credit includes severance obligations due upon termination 
we do not expect to make a cash outlay for severance benefits under these contracts during fiscal certain employment contracts also provide for continued medical coverage for a specified period 
the cost of these medical benefits was not estimated 
represents purchase orders for merchandise for re sale and commitments to purchase capital equipment 
represents letters of credit issued to landlords  banks and insurance companies 
we do not expect a cash outlay for these stand by letters of credit during quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors  including overall economic conditions  the timing of new store openings and related pre opening and other startup costs  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  weather conditions  shifts in timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise mix and pricing strategy 
our business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school and holiday seasons 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the first two fiscal quarters  and net sales and net income are lower during the second fiscal quarter than during the first fiscal quarter 
our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school sales and our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
we experienced losses in the second quarter of and the second quarter of and expect to experience a second quarter loss in fiscal we may continue to experience second quarter losses in future periods 
it is also possible we could experience losses in other quarters 
because of these fluctuations in net sales and net income loss  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and selected operating data for each of our last eight fiscal quarters 
the quarterly statement of operations data and selected operating data set forth below were derived from our unaudited financial statements and reflect  in our opinion  all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for these fiscal quarters

quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we utilize cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in short term financial instruments 
because of the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments 
our million wells fargo credit facility provides a source of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at the company s option  a libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  are generally considered long term 
we do not generally hedge these net investments 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments
