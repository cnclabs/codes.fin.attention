the miniplex product line and xel acquisitions discussed below were completed during fiscal  which impacted results of operations in fiscal the larscom acquisition was completed following the end of fiscal the company began implementing plans in march to consolidate xel manufacturing and administrative functions and announced plans in september to consolidate engineering as discussed below under restructuring charges 
consolidation activities and expenses related to the larscom acquisition will impact results of operations for the first half of fiscal and are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal on july   the company acquired the miniplex product line from terayon communication system  inc this product line gives telephone companies the capability of providing multiple plain old telephone services pots connections over a single copper pair a more cost effective alternative to resolving copper exhaust problems than the installation of new copper cable 
utilization of the miniplex product as a pair gain solution also saves companies the time and expense involved in the system turn up of a traditional digital loop carrier system

additionally  this acquisition brings existing customer contracts and relationships  sales  sales engineering  customer service and support personnel  and an engineering team based in newark  california 
the company s results for fiscal will reflect the results of larscom from the date of acquisition  as well as the costs associated with the acquisition and related consolidation 
the company s business is characterized by a concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers  with nortel networks accounting for a majority of sales in fiscal and approximately of sales in fiscal  and of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal verizon accounted for of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the concentration of the company s customers and significant fluctuations in orders from the company s major customers  the company s results from operations have and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in september  the company announced a delay in orders in the first quarter of fiscal from a large carrier customer 
the company has planned for some time for the eventual decline in sales of legacy products 
sales of legacy products to nortel networks declined from of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal to of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and are expected to significantly decline in the first quarter of fiscal the company believes that nortel networks may place a last time buy order for as products in the near future 
while the company believes it is positioning itself to offset the loss of legacy sales over the long term  reduced legacy sales will impact the company s results of operations in the near term  and sales of new products may be at lower margins than legacy sales 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and do not reflect adjustments that might result if the company were not to continue as a going concern 
the auditor s report on the company s financial statements as of july  contains an explanatory paragraph  which refers to uncertain revenue streams and a low level of liquidity and notes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has been and continues to prepare for reduced legacy sales through its recent acquisitions  investment in next generation broadband access products  and the alignment of its operating costs with management s revenue expectations in light of current conditions in the telecommunications equipment industry 
on a quarterly basis  management will continue to evaluate revenue outlook and plans to adjust spending levels as necessary 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and contractual obligations through fiscal based on management s current operating plan  although no such assurance can be given 
see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting future results below for a discussion of the potential impact if the company does not substantially meet its fiscal operating plan 
results of operations sales fiscal year ended july  june  june  thousands net sales percentage change from preceding year net sales for fiscal increased to  from net sales of  in fiscal overall  this increase is attributable to the acquisitions completed during the last eighteen months  including the series iad formerly called netengine product line acquired in january  the miniplex product line in july and xel 
table of contents communications  inc in february net sales of carrier and carrier access products  including xel products and services  as products and miniplex products  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the impact of these acquisitions  which contributed net sales of carrier and carrier access products totaling  in fiscal with these acquisitions  the company is less dependent on legacy product sales  particularly the as product which accounted for of net sales in fiscal as compared to and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in as product sales is due in part to the decrease in as sales to nortel networks  which are expected to significantly decline in the first quarter of fiscal net sales of enterprise access products  including the series iads and wansuite products  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the impact of the series iad acquisition and an increase in sales of all other enterprise access products 
net sales for fiscal increased to  from net sales of  in fiscal the largest factor leading to this increase was the acquisition of the series iad product line that added sales of  from the acquisition date on january  to june  net sales of carrier and carrier access products  primarily as products  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the increase in sales to the company s largest customer 
enterprise access products  including the series iad products  increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal excluding the series iad sales  sales of enterprise access products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which we believe to be the lingering impact of both economic and industry wide factors  as well as the overall decline in demand for legacy products 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s five largest customers in fiscal in alphabetical order were communication network services a division of british telecom  interlink communications systems  lucent technologies  nortel networks and verizon  with nortel and verizon representing an aggregate of of the company s sales in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results our results and performance are dependent on a limited customer base 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers  system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
sales to value added resellers and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal  as compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  sales to customers outside of north america increased and accounted for of total sales  which is due primarily to the increase in sales of the iad products 
the company expects that sales to customers outside the united states will continue to increase in fiscal gross profit fiscal year ended july  june  june  thousands gross profit percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal was attributable to the product sales mix and the products acquired in acquisitions that carry an overall lower gross margin percentage 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal year was attributable to a more favorable product sales mix  increased sales volume  and the benefit from cost reduction measures enacted during fiscal and  including productivity gains and lower fixed manufacturing and facilities costs  and the benefit from consolidation of manufacturing in madison  alabama from san jose  california 
additionally  the provision for excess and obsolete inventories decreased to  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal due to excess inventories in fiscal as a result of the decline in sales in that year 
in future periods  the company s gross profit margin will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  price competition  increases in material costs and changes in other components of 
table of contents cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit margins than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development fiscal year ended july  june  june  thousands research and development percentage of sales research and development r d expenses increased to  or of sales in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal this increase in expenditures was primarily due to headcount added in connection with the series iad product line acquisition in january and the xel acquisition in february additionally  r d expenses in fiscal included  for compensation expense related to bonuses  stock awards and restricted stock awards issued to employees in connection with the acquisition of xel 
r d as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the increased spending 
r d expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to staff reductions in fiscal and fiscal in addition to other cost reduction measures implemented by the company in its efforts to return to profitability 
the decrease in r d expense in fiscal as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal was due to reduced spending on higher sales volume 
the company considers product development expenditures to be important to future sales  but expects to adjust the level of these expenditures in relation to the level of sales achieved in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended july  june  june  thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to  or of sales in fiscal from  or of sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased headcounts between the two years and the impact of acquisitions  including compensation expense of  for bonuses  stock awards and restricted stock awards issued to employees in connection with the acquisition of xel 
amortization of intangible assets included in sg a was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
headcount increased in all areas  but primarily additional sales staff added to support the increased sales growth 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was due to increased spending on increased sales dollars 
sg a expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal from  or of sales in fiscal this decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to reduced headcounts between the two years  accrued severance costs in fiscal  and other cost reduction measures implemented by the company from march until august amortization of intangible assets included in sg a was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the significant decrease as a percentage of sales was due to lower spending on increased sales dollars 
as a result of the inclusion of sales resulting form the larscom acquisition  the company expects that sg a expenses will increase proportionally in fiscal

the final balloon payment of approximately  is due on february  on a note secured by the company s facility leased to the boeing company located at explorer boulevard in huntsville  alabama 
the company continues to seek a buyer for this facility  which represents a potential source of additional cash that may be used to partially fund the company s contractual obligations due in fiscal and the company may not  however  be able to complete a sale of the property on a timely basis or on favorable terms to the company 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and do not reflect adjustments that might result if the company were not to continue as a going concern 
the auditor s report on the company s financial statements as of july  contains an explanatory paragraph  which refers to uncertain revenue streams and a low level of liquidity and notes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to 
table of contents continue as a going concern 
liquidity would be further limited if the company s line of credit with rbc were to be accelerated or becomes unavailable 
the company has been and continues to prepare for reduced legacy sales through its recent acquisitions  investment in next generation broadband access products  and the alignment of its operating costs with management s revenue expectations in light of current conditions in the telecommunications industry 
on a quarterly basis  management will continue to evaluate revenue outlook and plans to adjust spending levels as necessary 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations and contractual obligations through fiscal based on management s current operating plan  although no such assurance can be given 
if the company does not substantially meet management s current operating plan  then the company may implement additional cost containment measures  or may need to seek additional financing or seek to renegotiate its contractual obligations 
while the company does not believe it will need to seek additional financing in the near term  the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
arrangements for additional financing or renegotiation of contractual obligations may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods might be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates 
the following represent what the company believes are among the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable under the guidance prescribed by sfas no 
s and  respectively 
the company s long lived assets include  but are not limited to  the property held for lease  furniture and equipment  software licenses  and goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions 

table of contents in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets during fiscal  the company obtained a third party appraisal for the property held for lease  and made assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company recorded impairment charges of  in fiscal related to these long lived assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on june   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and completed the analysis of its goodwill for impairment 
the company recorded an impairment charge of  during fiscal  related to goodwill 
the company performed an annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that there had been no impairment of goodwill 
inventories 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed on a quarterly basis and a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may increase or decrease the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory in future periods 
inventory reserves totaled  and  as of july  and june   respectively 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been performed  the price to the purchaser is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
a reserve for future product returns is established at the time of the sale based on historical return rates and return policies  including stock rotation for sales to distributors that stock the company s products 
the reserve for future product returns was  and  as of july  and june   respectively 
warranty provision 
the company records a warranty provision at the time of the sale based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future claims on products sold 
during fiscal  we reduced the warranty reserve by  based on recent actual experience reflecting a lower than expected return rate for products shipped in earlier years 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  actual product failure rates  material usage or other rework costs could differ from our estimates  which could result in revisions to our warranty liability  which totaled  and  as of july  and june   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for amounts billed 
the collectability of outstanding invoices is continually assessed 
assumptions are made regarding the customer s ability and intent to pay  and are based on historical trends  general economic conditions and current customer data 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from these assessments  there could be adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  and  as of july  and june   respectively 
deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
the valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets was  and  as of july  and june   respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after june  in its october meeting  the fasb board decided to defer the effective date of certain provisions of sfas sfas no 
does not currently impact the company s financial statements 

table of contents on january   the fasb completed its re deliberations of the project related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which culminated with the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin states that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether to consolidate that entity 
fin also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or a combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin originally applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  however  in december  the fasb issued fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which revised fin and required the adoption of fin or fin r for periods ending after december  fin and fin r do not currently impact the company s financial statements

among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors detailed below as well as the other factors set forth in item and item hereof 
all forward looking statements and risk factors included in this document are made as of the date hereof  based on information available to the company as of the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statement or risk factor 
you should consult the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports on form q and the company s annual report to stockholders 
our independent registered public accounting firm s report includes a going concern explanatory paragraph 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended july   a going concern explanatory paragraph  which states that the company has uncertain revenue streams and a low level of liquidity that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might results from the outcome of this uncertainty 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to maintain adequate financing and 
table of contents achieve a level of revenues and cash flow adequate to support our capital and operating requirements 
if we do not effectively manage our working capital or achieve targeted cost savings as contemplated in management s operating plan  we may need to implement additional cost containment measures  seek additional financing  and or seek to renegotiate our contractual obligations 
this uncertainty may cause our stock price to fall and impair our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary 
this uncertainty may create a concern among our current and future customers and vendors as to whether we will be able to fulfill our contractual obligations 
as a result  current and future customers may determine not to do business with us  or only do so on less favorable terms  which would cause our revenues to decline 
employee concern about the future of the business and their continued prospects for employment may cause them to seek employment elsewhere  depriving us of the human capital we need to be successful 
we are dependent on continued market acceptance of legacy products  acquired products  recently introduced products and new product development 
our future results of operations are dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for our existing products  products that we have acquired and new products in development 
historically  the majority of sales were provided by our legacy products  primarily the as product line 
the miniplex product line acquired from terayon communication systems  inc terayon can also be classified as a legacy product 
while we anticipate that net sales from legacy products will continue to decline  significant quarterly fluctuations are possible 
we have planned for some time for the eventual decline in sales of legacy products 
sales of the as have declined in recent quarters and are expected to significantly decline in the first quarter of fiscal and thereafter 
while we believe that we are positioning ourselves to offset the loss of legacy sales over the long term  reduced legacy sales will impact our results of operations in the near term  and sales of new products may be at lower margins than legacy sales 
market acceptance of our products is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in our control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services such as voice over ip voip  market acceptance of integrated access devices and packetized voice systems in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of our sales and marketing efforts 
failure of our products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement and testing or further refinement before we can make them commercially available 
we have  in the past  experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if our products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  we may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
we expect revenues from sales of our established products to decline over time both as a result of decreased demand and pricing pressure 
therefore  our future operating results are highly dependent on market acceptance of recently introduced products and products that may be introduced in the future 
there can be no assurance that such products will achieve widespread market acceptance  and  in fact  some other products we or larscom introduced in recent years have failed to meet its sales expectations 
the industry wide downturn caused sales of new products  such as larscom s  to be well below expectations 
we have  in the past  experienced delays and changes in course in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays and changes in course may occur in the future 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or product versions in a timely manner  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  or to achieve timely and widespread market awareness and acceptance of our new products or releases  would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

table of contents we currently have limited resources to invest in the development and marketing of new products 
if we do not substantially meet our operating plan  we may need to implement further cost reductions that could adversely affect our ability to develop and market new products 
there are risks associated with our acquisitions  potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of our strategy is to seek acquisition prospects and joint venture opportunities that complement our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage and customer base  enhance our technological capabilities or offer revenue and profit growth opportunities 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of larscom on july   for approximately  shares of our common stock 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of xel communications  inc xel on february   for approximately million  consisting of million in cash and a million convertible promissory note 
in july  we acquired the miniplex product line from terayon for up to  plus the assumption of service and warranty obligations for the miniplex product line  and agreed to purchase terayon s miniplex related inventories totaling approximately  on the earlier of the date used by the company or december  in january  we acquired the net assets used in and directly relating to polycom  inc s line of netengine integrated access devices for up to million  plus the assumption of service and warranty obligations for existing netengine customers as of the closing of the acquisition 
further transactions of this nature could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
joint ventures entail risks such as potential conflicts of interest and disputes among the participants  difficulties in integrating technologies and personnel  and risks of entering new markets 
no assurance can be given as to our ability to successfully integrate the businesses  products  technologies or personnel acquired in past acquisitions or those of other entities that may be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement 
a failure to integrate the larscom or xel businesses or the miniplex and netengine product lines or to integrate future potential acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results and performance are dependent on a limited customer base 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a majority of our sales  as well as the historical sales of xel and larscom 
we expect a majority of future sales to continue to be from a small number of customers 
while we are trying to diversify our customer base through the acquisitions of product lines and companies that have relationships with other customers  there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful  and we may continue to experience quarter to quarter fluctuations based on the unpredictable ordering patterns of a limited customer base 
there can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the economic climate and conditions in the telecommunication equipment industry are expected to remain unpredictable in fiscal  and possibly beyond 
sales for a given quarter generally depend on orders received from  and product shipments to  a limited number of customers 
sales to individual large customers are often related to the customer s specific equipment deployment projects  the timing of which are subject to change on limited notice  in addition to the ebbs and flows in our customers business conditions and the effect of competitors product offerings 
we have in the past experienced both accelerations and slowdowns in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
since most of our sales were in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  our backlog from the larscom acquisition and consequently our ability to predict revenues will continue to be limited 
in addition  announcements by us or our competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer  limit or end purchases of our new products 
in the event that we lose one or more of our large customers  anticipated orders from major customers fail to materialize  or delivery schedules are deferred or canceled as a 
table of contents result of the above  or other unanticipated factors  our business and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the downturn in the telecommunications industry  many of our customers have experienced financial difficulties and have reduced their expenditures on capital equipment 
the continued financial difficulties or failure of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
one of our larger customers  mci  filed for bankruptcy in and has only recently emerged from court protection  which could lead to a substantial loss in our customer base or further reorganizations  all of which could influence their order levels to us 
nortel networks accounted for a majority of net sales in fiscal and approximately of net sales in fiscal on a quarterly basis in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks of legacy products accounted for as much as  and as little as  of our net sales in a particular quarter 
we believe that nortel networks may place a last time buy order for as products in the near future and we have been and are preparing for reduced legacy sales to nortel networks and other customers as well 
our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and includes a material adverse change provision 
the lender under our credit facility received a security interest in and a lien on substantially all of our assets  including our existing and future accounts receivable  cash  general intangibles including intellectual property and equipment 
as a result of this security interest and lien  if there is an event of default under the credit facility  the lender under the credit facility would be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 
under those circumstances  we may not have sufficient funds to service our day to day operational needs 
any foreclosure by the lender under the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the credit facility requires us  among other things  to meet certain financial covenant tests and limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  make investments  pay dividends or engage in acquisitions  assets sales  mergers or consolidations without the consent of the lender 
the lender may accelerate and declare all outstanding borrowings under the credit facility immediately due and payable and or exercise its rights to foreclose on the collateral if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the loan documents  subject to notice and an opportunity to cure with respect to covenant defaults that may be cured  in the lender s opinion  a material adverse change has occurred in the our business or financial condition  or in the lender s opinion  there is an impairment of the prospect of repayment of borrowings outstanding under the line of credit or material impairment of the value or priority of the collateral securing borrowings 
we may not realize the benefits of the larscom acquisition 
the integration of verilink and larscom will be complex  time consuming and expensive and may disrupt our business 
our company will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize any benefits or synergies from the merger 
these challenges include the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of post merger events  including integrating the operations and technologies of the two companies  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company  retaining existing customers of both companies and attracting additional customers  retaining strategic partners of each company and attracting new strategic partners  and creating uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems 
the execution of these post merger events will involve considerable risks and may not be successful 
these risks include the potential disruption of our combined company s ongoing business and distraction of our management  the potential strain on our combined company s financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  unanticipated expenses and potential delays related to integration of the operations  technology and other resources of the two companies  the impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of the integration of personnel and any reductions in force  
table of contents greater than anticipated costs and expenses related to restructuring  including employee severance or relocation costs and costs related to vacating leased facilities  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger and the combined operations 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger 
the inability to successfully integrate the operations  technology and personnel of verilink and larscom  or any significant delay in achieving integration  could have a material adverse effect on our company and  as a result  on the market price of our common stock 
the cost of the larscom acquisition could harm our financial results 
verilink and larscom incurred transaction costs of approximately million in connection with the merger 
if the benefits of the merger do not exceed the associated costs  including costs associated with integrating the two companies and dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be materially harmed 
there are risks associated with the convertible notes issued in the xel acquisition 
we issued a total of million in convertible promissory notes in connection with our acquisition of xel 
through may    of these notes had been converted into common stock and  of the principal amount remains outstanding 
the principal on the notes bears interest at per annum  interest payable quarterly  and the entire outstanding principal becomes due and payable on february  the conversion price of the notes is per share of our common stock 
if a holder would receive net proceeds upon a sale of the underlying common stock in excess of what such holder would receive from us to liquidate the principal  we would expect that such holder would convert all or a portion of their note 
if our common stock trades below the conversion price and continues to trade below that level  it would be more likely that we would have to pay the principal and accrued interest in cash on the maturity date of the notes 
if we approach the maturity date without the holders converting their notes and if cash resources are insufficient to liquidate the notes  we may be forced to sell assets or seek additional equity or debt capital to satisfy our obligation 
while we anticipate that cash on hand and cash from operations will be sufficient to make the quarterly interest payments  we cannot assure you that our cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for payment of principal on the notes in the future or that any such alternative methods to raise the necessary capital would be successful or would permit us to meet our obligations 
furthermore  this outstanding obligation may limit our ability to borrow additional funds until the obligation is satisfied 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of our executive officers and key management  sales  and technical personnel 
we are a party to agreements with our executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service in the event of a change in control 
each of our executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
we implemented significant cost and staff reductions in recent years  which may make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to attract qualified personnel  could delay product development cycles or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on key suppliers and the availability of components 
we generally rely upon contract manufacturers to buy finished goods for certain product families and component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in our products 
additionally  larscom generally does not have any long term contracts with its suppliers and  in fact  as a result of its merger with vina technologies  inc  larscom has made a recent decision to place a majority of its business with a single contract manufacturer 
it is possible that larscom s major contract manufacturer and other suppliers will not continue to be able and willing to meet larscom s future requirements 
furthermore  xel relies on an original equipment manufacturer to produce one of its product lines 
on time delivery of our products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in our products 
currently  our third party sub contractors and we depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
we have historically obtained several components and licenses for certain embedded software from 
table of contents single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet our third party subcontractors requirements for any such components 
our third party sub contractors and we generally do not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of us or our third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of any of our outside contractors could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we identify a replacement contractor 
because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  including those relating to payment terms  cost of manufacturing  adequacy of manufacturing capacity  quality control  and timeliness of delivery  we are unable to predict whether such relationships would be on terms that we would regard as satisfactory 
any significant disruption in our relationships with our manufacturing sources would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
purchase orders from our customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as we do not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
we use internal forecasts to manage our general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  we may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices or termination of contracts 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant quarter to quarter fluctuations 
historically  our sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in variability in our quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to nortel networks during fiscal varied between quarters by as much as million 
our ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter could be due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
our sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment or service deployment projects 
we have experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond our control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors we are using to outsource our manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that our products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
we believe that sales in the past have been adversely impacted by merger activities by some of our top customers 
in addition  we have experienced delays as a result of the need to modify our products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve our sales objectives  we are dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  our agreements with certain of our customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
our customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases in certain periods 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 

table of contents operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors  particularly delays in new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive offerings and pricing actions  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors can materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a certain extent 
therefore  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to our expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  we have had in the past  and may have in the future  quarterly operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  since the sales cycles for larscom s products have historically been long and unpredictable  larscom has had difficulty predicting future revenue and as a result  our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
a customer s decision to purchase larscom s products often involved a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
larscom s sales cycles have varied from a few months to over a year 
as a result  larscom incurred substantial sales and marketing expenses and expended significant management effort without any assurance of a sale 
a long sales cycle also subjected larscom to other risks  including customer s budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review and order reductions and cancellations 
even after deciding to purchase larscom s products  larscom s customers often deployed larscom s products slowly 
our stock price has and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
specific factors applicable to us or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
the telecommunications equipment market is highly competitive with intense price pressure 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment addressed by our larscom  series and series iads  as  wansuite and xel product families can be characterized as highly competitive  with intensive equipment price pressure 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  wide ranging regulatory requirements and the entrance of low cost manufacturers 
the market for our prism and miniplex product lines can be characterized as declining over the long term 
the technology is not considered new and the market has experienced decline in recent years 

table of contents industry consolidation could lead to competition with fewer  but stronger competitors 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging  which represent both new market opportunities  as well as a threat to our current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco systems  lucent technologies  inc and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to our products and planned products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our products compete primarily with adtran  carrier access  kentrox  cisco systems  alcatel  rad  telco systems  adc  charles industries  general datacomm  godigital networks  fujitsu  lucent technologies  quick eagle networks and paradyne 
as a result of our acquisition of larscom  we compete to a lesser extent with other telecommunications equipment companies 
many of our competitors have more broadly developed distribution channels and have made greater advances than we have in emerging technologies 
cisco systems  lucent technologies and alcatel are three of the largest communications equipment companies in the world 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
in addition  many of our competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
the telecommunications equipment market was in an extended downturn and recovery may be delayed 
the downturn in the united states economy and the rapid and severe downturn for the domestic telecommunications industry  beginning in late  negatively affected demand for the products of verilink and larscom 
in addition to the deteriorating domestic economic environment  the worldwide telecommunications market also experienced reduced demand 
this decreased demand led to fluctuating order forecasts from some of the customers of verilink and larscom 
while events have indicated that a general economic recovery may be underway  conditions in the telecommunications industry remain challenging 
the difficult financial position of many of our customers resulting from the prolonged downturn may delay the timing of order increases for our products  if at all 
the telecommunications equipment market is subject to rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of our products 
our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
we may need to supplement our internal expertise and resources with specialized expertise or intellectual property from third parties to develop new products 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products that meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that we manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
in the past  some of the products larscom had planned and introduced have not met its sales expectations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 

table of contents as a result of the larscom acquisition  our business could be materially and adversely affected by shifts in the use of technology common throughout the industry today 
three shifts affecting larscom s products and industry are the integration of csu dsu technology into routers and switches  a move from t e services to more ethernet based services and the increase in demand for more managed  customer premise based services 
the failure to accommodate these shifts in technology could impact sales of our products and have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
the telecommunications equipment market requires regulatory compliance and compliance with evolving standards 
the market for our products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the us  our products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of our products 
standards for new services such as voice over ip  frame relay  performance monitoring services and dsl have evolved  such as the g 
shdsl standard 
as standards continue to evolve  we will be required to modify our products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are risks associated with our continuing entry into international markets 
we have limited experience in the international markets  but with the acquisition of the netengine products in january  we began expanding sales of our products outside of north america and are entering certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any of our sales are denominated in foreign currency  our sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell our products internationally  we must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of our products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude our marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the telecommunications equipment market is subject to third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we have not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in our products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to our products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in our products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to us if we discover third party patents related to our software products or if such patents are asserted against us in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into our products 
we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in our distribution agreements  we typically agree to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor  could 
table of contents result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against us and the failure of us to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there are limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and technologies 
we have been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of our single purpose network access technology 
we have not obtained significant patent protection for our access system or wansuite technologies 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing our patents or that a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents would hold our patents valid  enforceable and infringed 
we also typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors  and non disclosure agreements with our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of our technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of our technology and products more likely 
we have not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
since patent applications in the us are not publicly disclosed immediately  applications that we do not know about may have been filed by our competitors  which could relate to our products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to uncertainty  which may increase the risk and cost to us if we discover third party patents related to our software products or if such patents are asserted against us in the future 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we may be required to pay damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  and expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim against us and our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results
