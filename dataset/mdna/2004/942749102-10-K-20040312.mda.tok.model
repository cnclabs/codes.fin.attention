item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading supplier of products for use in the water quality  water safety  water flow control and water conservation markets in both north america and europe 
for more than years  we have designed and manufactured products that promote the comfort and safety of people and the quality and conservation for water used in commercial  residential and light industrial applications 
we earn revenue and income almost exclusively from the sale of our products 
our principal product lines include backflow preventers for preventing contamination of potable water caused by reverse flow within water supply lines and fire protection systems  a wide range of water pressure regulators for both commercial and residential applications  water supply and drainage products for commercial and residential applications  temperature and pressure relief valves for water heaters  boilers and associated systems  point of use water filtration and reverse osmosis systems for both commercial and residential applications  thermostatic mixing valves for tempering water in commercial and residential applications  and pumping systems for under floor radiant applications 
our business is reported in three geographic segments  north america  europe and china 
we distribute our products through three primary distribution channels  wholesale  diy and oems 
increases in gross national product gnp indicate a healthy economic environment which we believe positively impacts our results of operations 
the economic factors that we believe have the most significant direct effect on the demand for our products are the number of new housing construction starts and non residential  or commercial  construction starts 
interest rates have a significant indirect effect on the demand for our products due to the effect such rates have on the number of new residential and commercial construction starts and remodeling projects 
an additional factor that has had a significant effect on our sales is fluctuations in foreign currencies  as a significant portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
approximately of our sales during the year ended december  were from sales outside of the us compared to for the year ended december  we believe that the most significant factors relating to our future growth include our ability to continue to make selected acquisitions  both in our core markets as well as new complementary markets  regulatory requirements relating to the quality and conservation of water and increased demand for clean water and continued enforcement of plumbing and building codes 
we have completed fourteen acquisitions since divesting our industrial and oil and gas business in our acquisition strategy focuses on businesses that manufacture preferred brand name products that address our themes of water quality  water safety  water conservation and water flow control 
we target businesses that will provide us with one or more of the following an entry to new markets  an increase in shelf space with existing customers  a new or improved technology or an expansion of the breadth of our water quality  water conservation  water safety and water flow control products for the residential and commercial markets 
products representing a majority of our sales are subject to regulatory standards and code enforcement  which typically require that these products meet stringent performance criteria 
together with our commissioned manufacturers representatives  we have consistently advocated the development and enforcement of such plumbing codes 
we are focused on maintaining stringent quality control and testing procedures at each of our manufacturing facilities in order to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements and take advantage of the resulting demand for compliant products 
we believe that significant product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a significant barrier to entry for competitors 
we believe there is an increasing demand among consumers for products to ensure water quality  which creates growth opportunities for our products 
a significant risk we face is our ability to deal effectively with increases in raw material costs 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic to produce our products and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
recently  we have experienced increases in the costs of bronze  brass  cast iron and steel 
if we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of these cost increases by reducing production costs or successfully implementing price increases  these increases in raw material costs could reduce our profit margins 
another significant risk we face in all areas of our business is competition 
we consider brand preference  engineering specifications  plumbing code requirements  price  technological expertise  delivery times and breadth of product offerings to be the primary competitive factors 
as mentioned previously  we believe that significant product development  product testing capability and investment in plant and equipment is needed to manufacture products in compliance with code requirements  which represents a significant barrier to entry for competitors 
we are committed to maintaining our capital equipment at a level consistent with current technologies and we have invested million in capital equipment in and we expect to invest approximately million in we are also committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity in lower cost countries such as china  tunisia and bulgaria 
these manufacturing plant relocations and consolidations are an important part of our ongoing commitment to reduce production costs 
highlights highlights for the year ended december  include the following net sales increased million  or  in compared to due to the following in millions foreign exchange internal growth acquisitions impact of fin r operating margins increased to in from in income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to in from in on may   the company refinanced its million notes due december  through a private placement of million notes and million notes

giuliani anello manufactures and distributes valves and filters utilized in heating applications including strainer filters  solenoid valves  flow stop valves  stainless steel water filter elements and steam cleaning filters 
on april   we acquired martin orgee uk ltd located in kidderminster  west midlands  united kingdom for approximately million in cash 
martin orgee distributes a line of plumbing and heating products to the wholesale  commercial and oem markets in the united kingdom and southern ireland 
martin orgee also assembles pumping systems for under floor radiant heat applications 
recent developments on february   we entered into an agreement with yuhuan county cheng guan metal hose factory to acquire its equity interest in our shida joint venture for an expected purchase price of million  the assumption of approximately million of debt and the payment of million in connection with a three year non compete agreement 
after the transaction  we will own of shida 
the closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions and is expected to occur during the second quarter of on january   we acquired substantially all of the assets of flowmatic systems  inc located in dunnellon  florida  for approximately million in cash 
flowmatic designs and distributes a complete line of high quality reverse osmosis components and filtration equipment 
their product line includes stainless steel and plastic housings  filter cartridges  storage tanks  control valves  as well as complete reverse osmosis systems for residential and commercial applications 
we continue to implement a plan to consolidate several of our manufacturing plants in north america and europe 
at the same time we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in china and other low cost areas of the world 
the implementation of this manufacturing restructuring plan began during the fourth quarter of and will continue in the projects for which charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of are essentially complete 
during  we decided to expand the scope of the manufacturing restructuring plan and transfer certain production to low cost manufacturing plants in tunisia and bulgaria 
we expect to record an additional million in attributable to accelerated depreciation associated with the anticipated closure of one of our us manufacturing plants and a reduction in estimated useful lives of manufacturing equipment due to the transfer of production to lower cost countries 
the company recorded pre tax manufacturing restructuring and other costs of million net of recoveries for the manufacturing restructuring and other costs recorded consist primarily of severance costs  asset write downs and accelerated depreciation 
the severance costs  which have been recorded as restructuring  are for employees in manufacturing and administration groups 
we expect to make all of these severance payments during the first quarter of asset write downs consist primarily of write offs of inventory related to product lines that we have discontinued as part of this restructuring plan and are recorded in cost of goods sold 
accelerated depreciation is based on shorter remaining estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets and has been recorded in cost of goods sold 
other costs consist primarily of removal and shipping costs associated with relocation of manufacturing equipment and have been recorded in cost of goods sold and have been expensed as incurred 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our business is reported in three geographic segments north america  europe and china 
our net sales in each of these segments for each of the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  year ended december  sales sales change change in thousands north america    europe    china   total    the increase in net sales in north america in compared to is due to internal growth of  or  the appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar  which accounted for  or  of the increase and the impact of the adoption of fin r which accounted for  or  of the increase 
we cannot predict whether the canadian dollar will continue to appreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales 
the increase in the internal growth rate in north america is primarily due to increased unit sales into the diy and wholesale markets 
our sales into the north american diy market grew by in over due to the increasing store count of our large customers  the successful introduction of new products and consistent and reliable delivery of our products 
our wholesale market grew by in over due to increased sales of backflow preventors 
a significant increase or decrease in interest rates or an increase or drop in the new housing construction market could have a positive or negative impact on our sales 
not included in either the diy or wholesale market comparisons are fourth quarter sales of  from jameco international llc 
in october we determined that our minority interest in jameco international  llc qualified as a variable interest in a variable interest entity under fin r and  as we are the primary beneficiary  should be consolidated into our north american results 
jameco international llc s annual sales for the year ended were approximately  since the adoption was effective october   we should continue to have this impact for the next three quarters as we continue to consolidate jameco international llc in accordance with fin r 
the increase in net sales in europe in compared to is primarily due to the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar  which accounted for  or of the increase  the inclusion of net sales of acquired companies of  or  and internal growth of  or 
the foreign exchange growth is due to our average year to date euro rate increasing over the average year to date rate for we cannot predict whether the euro will continue to appreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our net sales 
the acquired growth is due to the inclusion of the net sales of adev electronic sa and ek eminent ek both acquired on july   f r foerster and rothman gmbh  acquired on july   martin orgee  acquired on april   and giuliani anello  acquired on july  we expect these recent acquisitions will have a positive impact on sales for the next two quarters 
the internal growth in sales is primarily due to increased sales into the european oem market 
inclusive of the acquisitions  and exclusive of the impact of foreign exchange  our sales into the european oem market increased approximately  or 
the decrease in net sales in china in compared to is primarily due to an adjustment of  made in the second quarter of for previously recorded sales and increased sales rebates and returns recorded at our twt joint venture in tianjin 
this was partially offset by the inclusion of net sales of our shida joint venture  which we established on march   of approximately  gross profit 
gross profit for increased  or  compared to this increase is primarily due to internal growth of  the change in foreign exchange rates  which accounted for  of the increase  the inclusion of gross profit from acquired companies of  a reduction of restructuring and other charges of  in compared to  and the inclusion of the gross profit of jameco international llc of  excluding the costs of restructuring for both periods  gross profits would have increased  or 
the internal growth is primarily due to the north american segment  which increased internal gross profits by  this increase is primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and increased sales volume 
the internal growth in gross profit was offset by a loss in our china segment of  this loss is due to start up costs and under absorbed manufacturing costs due to a delay in production at our new wholly owned manufacturing plant in china 
we believe capacity utilization will be increasing in at this plant 
it was also offset by inventory write downs  increased sales rebates and returns and other net adjustments at our twt joint venture located in tianjin  china 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses for increased  or  compared to this increase is primarily due to an internal increase of  the change in foreign exchange rates  which accounted for  of the increase  and the inclusion of operating expenses of acquired companies and jameco international llc  which together accounted for  of the increase 
the internal increase in sg a expenses is primarily due to increased product liability expense  workers compensation expenses  professional fees  which include legal and audit expenses  pension costs and variable selling expenses due to increased sales volumes 
although there is an absolute increase in our sg a expense over  our sg a expense as a percent of sales for decreased to compared to for operating income 
operating income by geographic segment for each of the years ended december  and was as follows years ended december  change in thousands north america    europe    china   corporate    total    the increase in operating income in north america in compared to is primarily due to internal growth of  a reduction of restructuring and other charges of  the appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar  which accounted for  of the increase  and inclusion of income from jameco international llc of  the internal growth is due to our increased gross profit partially offset by increased sg a expense 
to the extent we are unable to recover raw material cost increases from our customer these cost increases would adversely affect our operating income 
for  we recorded  compared to  in for costs associated with our manufacturing restructuring plan 
excluding these costs  the operating income in north america would have been  for compared to  for we expect to record approximately  in for additional manufacturing restructuring expenses primarily attributable to accelerated depreciation associated with the anticipated closure of one of our us manufacturing plants and a reduction in estimated useful lives of manufacturing equipment due to the transfer of production to lower cost countries 
the increase in operating income in europe in compared to is due to the euro appreciating against the us dollar  which accounted for  of the increase  internal growth of  the inclusion of income from acquired companies of  and a reduction of restructuring and other charges of  we cannot predict whether the euro will continue to appreciate against the us dollar in future periods or whether future foreign exchange rate fluctuations will have a positive or negative impact on our operating income

corporate expenses are primarily for compensation expense  professional fees  including legal and audit expenses and benefit administration costs 
the increase in corporate expenses is primarily due to increased legal and audit expenses in interest expense

on september   we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to our  notes due december the swap converted the interest from fixed to floating 
on august   we sold the swap and received  in cash 
in the year ended december   we reduced interest expense by  by amortizing the adjustment to the fair value of the swap 
in the year ended december   we reduced interest expense by  for the effectiveness of the swap 
the amortization of the swap was completed upon repayment of the  notes 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of  euros outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
we swapped the variable rate from the revolving credit facility  which is three month euribor plus  for a fixed rate of 
the impact of swap was immaterial to the overall interest expense 
income taxes

excluding the manufacturing restructuring costs incurred in both periods  income from continuing operations would have increased  or 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap we sometimes use non gaap measures of net income  net income per share  income from continuing operations or income from continuing operations per share  and net cash provided by continuing operations that we believe are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our historical financial performance and future prospects 
the non gaap results  which are adjusted to exclude certain costs  expenses  gains and losses from the comparable gaap measures  are an indication of our baseline performance before gains  losses or other charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core operating results 
these non gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our financial performance as well as for forecasting future periods 
for these reasons  management believes these non gaap measures can be useful to investors  potential investors and others 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or income per share prepared in accordance with gaap

our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks as amended  the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to  which includes a  tranche for euro based borrowings and matures in february the revolving credit facility is being used to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   long term debt included  outstanding on the revolving credit facility for euro based borrowings and no amounts were outstanding for us dollar borrowings 
this facility was amended during the fourth quarter of to permit us to enter into a guarantee of a  credit line utilized by our european subsidiaries and to allow us to use the proceeds from our december public offering for purposes other than the repayment of our credit facility 
outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate determined by the type currency of loan plus an applicable margin determined by the company s debt rating  depending on the applicable base rate and our bond rating

see part i  item  business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities as of december  was  compared to  as of december  this increase is primarily due to the net proceeds received from the  private placement and the stock offering that raised net cash of approximately  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december  compared to to as of december  cash and cash equivalents were  as of december  compared to  as of december  our total debt increased to  as of december  from  as of december  primarily due to the issuance of our  senior notes reduced by the repayment of our  principal amount of notes due december  we had positive free cash flow of  defined as net cash provided by continuing operations minus capital expenditures and dividends plus proceeds from sale of assets during the year ended december  versus positive free cash flow of  in the comparable prior year period 
this decrease in compared to was primarily due to increased inventories  pension funding of  and increased dividends partially offset by increases in accounts payable and reductions in accounts receivable 
the effect of the free cash flow and proceeds from our stock offering has been to reduce our net debt to capitalization ratio defined as short and long term interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents as a percentage of the sum of short and long term interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents plus total stockholders equity  including minority interest to for from for we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of our company because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by continuing operations is provided below years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operations    less additions to property  plant  and equipment   plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment  less dividends    free cash flow    our net debt to capitalization is not computed in accordance with gaap 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of net debt is provided below december  in thousands current portion of long term debt   plus long term debt  net of current portion   less cash and cash equivalents   net debt   a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below december  in thousands net debt   total stockholders equity   plus minority interest   capitalization   we anticipate that available funds from current operations  existing cash and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may have to consider external sources of financing for any large future acquisitions 
our current revolving credit facility expires in february we are currently reviewing proposals from our syndicate of banks with the intention of structuring a new revolving line of credit 
our long term contractual obligations as of december  are presented in the following table payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations  including current maturities a  operating lease obligations     capital lease obligations  total      a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet we maintain letters of credit that guarantee our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately  as of december  and  as of december  our letters of credit are primarily letters of credit associated with insurance coverage and to a lesser extent foreign purchases 
our letters of credits generally expire within one year of issuance 
the increase is primarily associated with insurance coverage 
these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down 
therefore  they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that effect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumptions on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
except as noted in product liability and pension benefits below  there were no changes in accounting policies or significant changes in accounting estimates during we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with the audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a binding agreement  the product has shipped and title has passed  the sales price to the customer is fixed or is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue based upon a determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which  based on the majority of our shipping terms  is considered to have occurred upon shipment of the finished product 
some shipping terms require the goods to be received by the customer before title passes 
in those instances  revenues are not recognized until the customer has received the goods 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and allowances and for customer programs 
provisions for returns and allowances are made at the time of sale  derived from historical trends and form a portion of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer programs  which are primarily annual volume incentive plans  allow customers to earn credit for attaining agreed upon purchase targets from us 
we record customer programs as an adjustment to net sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable 
the development of our allowance for doubtful accounts varies by region but in general is based on a review of past due amounts  historical write off experience  as well as aging trends affecting specific accounts and general operational factors affecting all accounts 
in north america  management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable and establishes specific reserves against financially troubled customers 
in addition  factors are developed utilizing historical trends in bad debts  returns and allowances 
the ratio of these factors to sales on a rolling twelve month basis is applied to total outstanding receivables net of accounts specifically identified to establish a reserve 
in europe  management develops their bad debt allowance through an aging analysis of all their accounts  with analysis on the aging of specific delinquent accounts 
in china  where payment terms are generally extended  we reserve all accounts receivable in excess of one year from the invoice date and specifically reserve for identified uncollectible accounts receivable less than one year old 
we uniformly consider current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also aggressively monitor the credit worthiness of our largest customers  and periodically review customer credit limits to reduce risk 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with costs generally determined on a first in first out basis 
we utilize both specific product identification and historical product demand as the basis for determining our excess or obsolete inventory reserve 
we identify all inventories that exceed a range of one to three years in sales 
this is determined by comparing the current inventory balance against unit sales for the trailing twelve months 
new products added to inventory within the past twelve months are excluded from this analysis 
a portion of our products contain recoverable materials  therefore the excess and obsolete reserve is established net of any recoverable amounts 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
in certain countries  additional inventory reserves are maintained for potential losses experienced in the manufacturing process 
the reserve is established based on the prior year s inventory losses adjusted for any change in the gross inventory balance 
goodwill and other intangibles we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas on january   and as a result we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fas we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
in our larger  more complex acquisitions  the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
this is the second year since adoption  and for both years we have had excess economic support for the carrying value of our goodwill and intangibles 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as future sales volume  selling price changes  material cost changes  cost savings programs and capital expenditures could significantly affect our valuations 
other changes that may affect our valuations include  but are not limited to product acceptances and regulatory approval 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
product liability and workers compensation costs because of retention requirements associated with our insurance policies  we are generally self insured for potential product liability claims and for workers compensation costs associated with workplace accidents 
for product liability cases in the us  management estimates expected settlement costs by utilizing stop loss reports provided by our third party administrators as well as developing internal historical trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
prior to  we used insurance carrier trend factors to determine our product liability reserves 
however  we determined circumstances inherent in those trends were not necessarily indicative of our own circumstances regarding our claims 
management believes the internal trend factors will more accurately reflect final expected settlement costs 
in other countries  we maintain insurance coverage with relatively high deductible payments  as product liability claims tend to be smaller than those experienced in the us changes in the nature of claims or the actual settlement amounts could affect the adequacy of this estimate and require changes to the provisions 
workers compensation liabilities in the us are recognized for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported and for changes in the status of individual case reserves 
at the time a workers compensation claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined based on management s estimates of the nature and severity of the claims and based on analysis provided by third party administrators and by various state statutes and reserve requirements 
we have developed our own trend factors based on our specific claims experience 
in other countries where workers compensation costs are applicable  we maintain insurance coverage with limited deductible payments 
because the liability is an estimate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than reported 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for contingencies fas  we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
estimates of potential outcomes of these contingencies are developed in consultation with outside counsel 
while this assessment is based upon all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to fully resolve this litigation cannot be predicted with any assurance of accuracy 
final settlement of these matters could possibly result in significant effects on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
pension benefits we account for our pension plans in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
employers accounting for pensions fas 
in applying fas  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the primary assumptions are as follows weighted average discount rate this rate is used to estimate the current value of future benefits 
this rate is adjusted based on movement in long term interest rates 
in  we reduced the discount rate to from in to reflect the high quality bond yields as of the measurement date  which is september expected long term rate of return on assets this rate is used to estimate future growth in investments and investment earnings 
the expected return is based upon a combination of historical market performance and anticipated future returns for a portfolio reflecting the mix of equity  debt and other investments indicative of our plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return was reduced in to from in  as management believes it more properly reflects the long term rate of return achievable with the asset allocation required by our retirement plan investment policy 
rates of increase in compensation levels this rate is used to estimate projected annual pay increases  which are used to determine the wage base used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
this rate remained unchanged in at  and is reasonable in management s estimation 
we determine these assumptions based on consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
any variance in the above assumptions could have a significant impact on future recognized pension costs  assets and liabilities 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rates to accrue income taxes 
effective tax rates are determined based on budgeted earnings before taxes including our best estimate of permanent items that will impact the effective rate for the year 
management periodically reviews these rates with outside tax advisors and changes are made if material discrepancies from expectations are identified 
we recognize deferred taxes for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the rules of financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
certain factors affecting future results we face intense competition and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease 
competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position  leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices  either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits 
we encounter intense competition in all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  we anticipate that we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products to stay competitive  potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for  and inventory valuation of  these products 
some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products which are priced in other currencies 
reductions or interruptions in the supply of raw materials and increases in the costs of raw materials could reduce our profit margins and adversely impact our ability to meet our customer delivery commitments 
we require substantial amounts of raw materials  including bronze  brass  cast iron  steel and plastic and substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
the availability and costs of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  new laws or regulations  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels 
we are not currently party to any long term supply agreements 
our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable costs  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
recently  we have experienced an increase in the costs of bronze  brass  cast iron  and steel 
if we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of these cost increases through lowering other costs of production or successfully implementing price increases to our customers  such cost increases from our vendors could have a negative effect on our financial results 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or our profitability 
one of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary water related products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  companies acquired recently and in the future may not achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we have faced increasing competition for acquisition candidates which have resulted in significant increases in the purchase prices of many acquisition candidates 
this competition  and the resulting purchase price increases  may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us  possibly leading to a decrease in the rate of growth of our revenues and profitability 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  and unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
down economic cycles  particularly reduced levels of housing starts and remodeling  could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
the businesses of most of our customers  particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and home improvement retailers  are cyclical 
therefore  the level of our business activity has been cyclical  fluctuating with economic cycles 
we also believe our level of business activity is influenced by housing starts and renovation and remodeling  which are  in turn  heavily influenced by interest rates  consumer debt levels  changes in disposable income  employment growth and consumer confidence 
if these and other factors cause a material reduction in housing and remodeling starts  our revenues and profits would decrease and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results 
since we sell and manufacture our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  which could increase our costs of doing business internationally  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  which could have an adverse impact on our profits  the costs of hiring and retaining senior management in overseas operations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  which could reduce our productivity  costs of compliance with differing labor regulations  especially in connection with restructuring our overseas operations  laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  substantial amounts of raw materials  including bronze  plastic  brass  cast iron  steel and plastics we require are purchased from outside sources and fluctuations in foreign exchange could have an adverse impact on our profits  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  which may be costly and require significant time to implement  and political risks specific to foreign jurisdictions 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our reported results 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies  as a significant portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
approximately of our sales during the year ended december  were from sales outside of the us compared to for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar had a positive impact on sales of approximately million 
for the year ended december   the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar had a positive impact on sales of approximately million 
for the year ended december   the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar had an adverse impact on sales of approximately million 
if our share of revenue in non dollar denominated currencies continues to increase in future periods  exchange rate fluctuations will likely have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
further  the chinese government may cease its utilization of a fixed rate of exchange of the chinese rmb against the us dollar which could adversely affect our current favorable cost structure for goods we source from our joint ventures  our wholly owned subsidiary in china and our outside vendors 
there are significant risks in expanding our manufacturing operations in china 
as part of our strategy  we are shifting a significant portion of our manufacturing operations to china to reduce our production costs 
due to the outbreak of the sars virus  some of these cost reduction efforts were delayed  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience additional delays 
this shift will subject a greater portion of our operations to the risks of doing business in china 
the chinese legal system is relatively new and lacks transparency  which gives the chinese central and local government authorities a higher degree of control over our business in china than is customary in developed economies and makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approval in china inherently unpredictable 
in addition  the protection accorded our proprietary technology and know how under the chinese legal system is not as strong as in the united states and  as a result  we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantage 
although the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform and a policy of welcoming foreign investments for the past two decades  there can be no assurance that the chinese government will not change its current policies in the future  making continued business operations in china difficult or unprofitable 
to the extent we are not successful in implementing our manufacturing restructuring plan  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our manufacturing restructuring plan  which we began in  was initiated to reduce our manufacturing costs 
if our planned manufacturing plant consolidations in the united states and europe and our production capability expansion in china are not successful  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher utilization levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the equipment and management systems necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in our ability to manufacture our products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities  all of which are subject to this risk  and such fluctuations at any of these facilities could cause an increase in our production costs and a corresponding decrease in our profitability 
for example  in one of our manufacturing facilities was shut down for a period of time as a result of a fire and we were required to source products from external vendors at substantially higher costs 
we also have a vertically integrated manufacturing process 
each segment is dependent upon the prior process and any breakdown in one segment will adversely affect all later components 
fluctuations in our production process may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our inability to meet our delivery obligations could result in a loss of our customers and negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance and regulatory approvals  our revenues and our profitability may decrease 
our failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  changes in specifications required by our customers  plumbing codes and or regulatory agencies  technically complex products  and constant improvement to existing products and introductions of new products 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands and the requirements of plumbing codes and or regulatory agencies 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers  that could delay or prevent our development  introduction  approval or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position  in addition  added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and disposal and workplace safety 
such laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
we could also be liable for the costs of property damage or personal injury to others 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
under certain environmental laws  the current and past owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination  even if they did not know of or were not responsible for such contamination 
these laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at any site 
therefore  our ownership and operation of real property and our disposal of waste could lead to liabilities under these laws 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  costs relating to these environmental matters 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur additional costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be significant 
environmental litigation  enforcement and compliance are inherently uncertain and we may experience significant costs in connection with environmental matters 
for more information  see part i  item  business product liability  environmental  and other litigation matters 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we have been limited from selling products from time to time because of existing patents 
we face risks from product liability and other lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims or other lawsuits  including  among others that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  damages from these claims would have to be paid from our assets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in particular  if we settle or conclude litigation in a quarterly or annual reporting period  there could be a material impact on our operating results for that quarter or year 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and other lawsuits in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have product liability and general insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
for more information  see part i  item  business product liability  environmental  and other litigation matters 
the requirements of fas may result in a write off of all or a portion of our goodwill  which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
if we are required to take an impairment charge to our goodwill in connection with the requirements of fas  our operating results may decrease and our financial condition may be harmed 
as of december   we had goodwill of million  or of our total assets and of our total stockholders equity 
under fas  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill and are required to perform annual impairment reviews thereafter 
we have concluded that no impairment existed at january   the time of adoption of fas and at october   the time of our annual review 
we perform our annual test for indications of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or sooner if indicators exist 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our largest customer  the home depot  inc  accounted for approximately million  or  of our total net sales for the year ended december   and million  or  of our total net sales for year ended december  our customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and are able to terminate their relationships with us at any time 
a significant reduction in orders or change in terms from the home depot  inc could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
certain indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments 
our revolving credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  our creditors could declare a default under our revolving credit facility and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our indebtedness may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
one of our stockholders can exercise substantial influence over our company 
as of february   timothy p 
horne  a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of class a common stock assuming conversion of all shares of class b common stock beneficially owned by mr 
horne into class a common stock and approximately of our outstanding shares of class b common stock  which represents approximately of the total outstanding voting power 
as long as mr 
horne controls shares representing at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding stock  mr 
horne will be able to unilaterally determine the outcome of all stockholder votes and other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
shares of our class a common stock eligible for public sale could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
as of february  there were outstanding  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock 
shares of our class b common stock may be converted into class a common stock at any time on a one for one basis 
all of the shares of class a common stock are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws  except for any shares held by our affiliates  sales of which will be limited by rule under the securities act 
in addition  under the terms of a registration rights agreement with respect to outstanding shares of our class b common stock  the holders of our class b common stock have rights with respect to the registration of the underlying class a common stock 
under these registration rights  the holders of class b common stock may require  on up to two occasions  that we register their shares for public resale 
if we are eligible to use form s or a similar short form registration statement  the holders of class b common stock may require that we register their shares for public resale up to two times per year 
if we elect to register any shares of class a common stock for any public offering  the holders of class b common stock are entitled to include shares of class a common stock into which such shares of class b common stock may be converted in such registration 
however  we may reduce the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions 
we will pay all expenses in connection with any registration  other than underwriting discounts and commissions 
pursuant to the exercise of these registration rights  we have registered the resale of  shares of our class a common stock on a form s shelf registration statement  of which  shares remained available for resale as of february  if all of the available registered shares are sold into the public market the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 
our class a common stock has insignificant voting power 
our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes for each share and our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share 
as of january   our class b common stock constituted of our total outstanding common stock and of the total outstanding voting power and thus is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business 
the trading price of our class a common stock may be volatile 
the trading price of our class a common stock may be volatile and fluctuations in the trading price may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  our failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results and or buy sell recommendations by securities analysts  the timing of announcements by us or our competitors concerning significant product line developments  contracts or acquisitions or publicity regarding actual or potential results or performance  fluctuation in our quarterly operating results caused by fluctuations in revenues and expenses  substantial sales of our class a common stock by our existing shareholders  general stock market conditions and other economic or external factors 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include those that authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote  limit stockholders ability to call special meetings  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas which requires companies to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company must also record a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long lived asset and depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability must be increased each period for the passage of time with the offset recorded as an operating expense 
the liability must also be adjusted for changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
companies must also recognize a gain or loss on the settlement of the liability 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  at the date of the adoption of fas  companies are required to recognize a liability for all existing asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement costs 
we have adopted fas effective january  and its adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
the principal difference between this statement and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit on activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we adopted fas effective january  and its adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of certain guarantees 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
fin required the application of the recognition provisions of fin prospectively to guarantees issued after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin effective december  we do offer warranties on our products  but the returns under warranty have been immaterial 
the warranty reserve is part of the sales returns and allowances  a component of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we adopted fin effective january  and its adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure fas 
fas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
fas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  fas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas were effective for fiscal years ended after december  we are currently continuing to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and we provided the disclosures required by fas in december  the eitf issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this consensus provides guidance in determining when a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered during fiscal periods beginning after june  we adopted eitf effective july  and its adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities vie by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin was effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  in october  the fasb delayed the effective date for some vies that existed prior to february   provided the reporting entity had not issued financial statements reporting the vie in accordance with interpretation fin was effective for the first interim or annual period ending after december  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin fin r 
under the revised provisions  public entities are required to apply the guidance if the entity has interests in vies commonly referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  we adopted fin r and as a result have consolidated jameco international  llc the llc effective october  the fourth quarter of fiscal 
the llc imports and sells vitreous china  imported faucets and faucet parts and imported bathroom accessories to the north american home improvement retail market 
its annual sales for the twelve months ended december   were approximately  the llc maintains a line of credit with a financial institution collateralized by a first security interest in the llc s assets 
the creditors have no recourse to the company 
the assets as of december  of  are comprised primarily of accounts receivable and inventory which we believe are collectable and saleable  respectively  within the normal course of business 
we have a subordinated security interest in the assets of the llc pertaining to our loan receivable of  at december   which eliminates in consolidation as the result of the application of fin r
