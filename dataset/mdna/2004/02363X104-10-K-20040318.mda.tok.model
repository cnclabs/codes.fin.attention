item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this report including  but not limited to  the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  the company s performance and financial results 
all statements  trend analysis and other information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the company and the real estate investments it has made constitute forward looking statements 
shareholders and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and a number of factors could affect the future results of the company and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
these factors include local and national economic conditions  the amount of new construction  interest rates on single family home mortgages and on the company s variable rate borrowings  government regulation  price inflation  the level of real estate and other taxes imposed on the properties  labor problems and natural disasters and other items discussed under quot  risk factors quot  in item of this report 
general the company s primary business is the operation of multifamily apartment properties as long term investments 
accordingly  the company s operating results will depend primarily on the net operating income generated by its multifamily apartment properties 
this  in turn  will depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the properties and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
several factors influence this  including local and national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single family mortgage loans 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property 
the multifamily real estate industry is experiencing soft market conditions in most markets nationwide  including many of those in which the company owns properties 
these conditions are primarily attributable to i nbsp  slow or negative economic growth which has limited job creation and the number of new households  ii nbsp  historically low mortgage interest rates which have made home ownership more affordable for many persons who would otherwise be renting apartments and iii nbsp  continuous building of new apartment properties in markets that are already experiencing low vacancy rates 
in response to these conditions  the company has had to reduce rental rates and grant rental concessions to attract and retain quality tenants and maintain the physical occupancy levels at its properties 
nevertheless  the overall average physical occupancy of the company s multifamily apartment properties has dropped from during to in in addition  the economic oc cupancy has declined 
for the year ended december   the average economic occupancy of the company s multifamily apartment properties was  compared to for the year ended december  economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income divided by the maximum amount of rental income which could be derived from each property 
this statistic is reflective of rental concessions  delinquent rents and other non revenue units such as model units and employee units 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s real estate investments as of december  the company did not acquire or sell any multifamily apartment properties during however  the company did expand the types of assets in which it may invest during to include i nbsp  mortgage backed securities issued or guaranteed as to the payment of principal or interest by an agency of the us government or a federally chartered corporation such as the fnma  gnma or the fhlmc quot  agency securities quot  ii nbsp  mezzanine level financing provided to unaffiliated developers of residential real estate which can take a variety of forms including subordinated mortgage loans and preferred equity investments  and iii nbsp  equity investments in other reits and similar real estate companies  which can include publicly traded common and preferred stocks  as well as controlling and non controlling interests in other real estate businesses such as property management companies 
as of december   the company held agency securities with a fair market value of approxi mately nbsp  million and investments in other real estate companies with a fair market value of approximately nbsp  million 
by investing in agency securities  mezzanine level financing of residential properties  and investments in other real estate companies  the company seeks to supplement and stabilize its cash flow by investing in assets that are less affected by the variables that affect the cash flow generated by investments in apartments 
in addition  investments in agency securities will allow the company to quickly invest the proceeds from the sale of additional stock or from the sale of any of its real property investments at potentially higher returns than traditional money market investments 
the overall mix of these various types of investments will vary from time to time as the company seeks to take advantage of opportunities in the real estate industry 
in general  however  it is anticipated that at least of the company s equity capital will be invested in multifamily apartment properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management of the company to make a number of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
the application of these judgments  assumptions and estimates can affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported by the company 
all of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements filed in response to item of this report 
the company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies as they involve judgments  assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
investment in mortgage backed securities valuation because all of the company s investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale securities  they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values reflect the average of price quotes received from brokers  which are reviewed by the company 
price quotes are subject to the brokers judgments  assumptions and estimates 
effect of classification of securities on earnings because the company s investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale securities  changes in estimated fair values are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
the company does not intend to hold any of its securities for trading purposes  however  if the company s available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in the company s earnings 
investment in real estate establishment of depreciation policy the company s investment in real estate is carried on the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset  generally years on multifamily residential apartment buildings  years on commercial buildings and five to fifteen years on capital improvements  and is calculated using the straight line method 
depreciation of capital improvements on the company s commercial property is based on the term of the related tenant lease using the straight line method 
shorter or longer depreciable lives and method of depreciation directly impact depreciation expense recorded in earnings 
establishment of capitalization policy maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while significant improvements  renovations and replacements are capitalized 
the company s capitalization policy is based on management s judgment and is not necessarily consistent with companies of similar type as there is diversity in such accounting policies adopted by the real estate industry 
the company believes its policy is reasonable in that it capitalizes costs considered to add value to the property  while it expenses those costs which are considered recurring maintenance items 
in particular  the cost of replacing carpet  vinyl flooring and appliances in individual apartments are expensed  although some real estate companies capitalize these costs 
the financial accounting standards board quot  fasb quot  standard setting agenda includes a project to develop additional guidance regarding cost capitalization  which  upon adoption by the company  may require a change in the company s capitalization policy 
a different capitalization policy could cause a fluctuation in the company s earnings 
review of properties for impairment management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
the recognition of an impaired property and the potential impairment calculation are subject to a considerable degree of judgment  the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flow of each property is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts  future rental expenses  and future capital expenditures 
such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the properties operate  the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets  and tax and insurance expenses 
different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may result in different results 
the company does periodically compare the results of its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly

as of january   the company merged with america first apartment investors  lp the nbsp  quot  partnership quot 
as a result of this merger  the company assumed the assets  liabilities and business operations of the partnership 
the company itself had no material assets or operations prior to its merger with the partnership 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company for all periods prior to january  are those of the partnership 
nbsp  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the principal difference between the company s reported results of operations during compared to was the recognition of  of gain during the second quarter as a result of the repayment of the subordinate note held by the company from the owners of jefferson place apartments 
without this gain  the company would have recorded a net loss of approximately  for the year 
on june   the jefferson place apartments were sold and the company recorded a gain of  on the repayment of its subordinate note due from the owners of jefferson place apartments 
the total gain is comprised of  of cash proceeds from the sale less  of written off receivables for a net cash gain of  the company also recorded a  non cash gain representing the reversal of a loss reserve 
the subordinate note due from the owners of jefferson place apartments had an original principal value of  a net bo ok value of  and was received by the partnership s predecessor in in connection with the re issuance of the jefferson place tax exempt bonds which were originally owned by the partnership s predecessor 
the subordinate note represented unpaid tax exempt interest and principal on the original bonds 
in connection with the re issuance  the partnership s predecessor also issued a guarantee of the re issued bonds that was collateralized by one of its other properties and recorded a loss reserve of  for the collateral guarantee 
the loss reserve represented management s best estimate of the potential guarantee loss based upon the estimated fair values of the respective properties at the inception of the guarantee and was reversed on june   when the company was relieved of its guarantee via the sale of jefferson place 
rental income decreased  or from to  due to the decline in the economic occupancies of the properties 
as discussed under quot  general  quot  rental concessions have significantly increased in order to attract and retain qualified tenants  and have reduced net effective rental rates earned at the company s properties 
in addition  the average physical occupancy of the company s multifamily apartment properties declined by in as a result  the average effective annual rentals per unit of the company s multifamily apartment properties decreased to  in from  in real estate operating expenses  comprised principally of real estate taxes  property insurance  utilities  property management fees  repairs and maintenance  and salaries and related employee expenses of on site employees  increased  or from to this is primarily due to an overall increase in the premium rates for property insurance  which was approximately  and increases in salaries and related expenditures of  this was slightly offset by reductions in management fees and contract expenses 
depreciation expense increased  or from to which is attributable to capital improvements of approximately  made during interest and dividend income increased a net  in compared to of this increase   is due to the purchase of mortgage backed securities during the last quarter of the company purchased mortgage backed securities with a par value of  during the fourth quarter of the pools have stated rates ranging from to and various principal maturities 
the premium paid related to these mortgage backed securities will be amortized using the effective yield method over the life of the pools 
premium amortization of  was recognized as a deduction to interest income during prior to the fourth quarter of  the company had no such investments and did not record any mortgage investment income 
offsetting this increase is a decrease in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents which was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the average interest rate during was compared to for the company recorded a loss of  on its interest rate swap agreements in  compared to a gain of  recorded in such gains and losses are due to changes in the estimated valuation of the agreements 
interest expense decreased  or from to which is due to the decline in the average interest rate of the company s variable rate debt which declined to in  compared to in approximately of the company s bonds and mortgage notes payable bear interest at variable rates as of december  general and administrative expenses increased  or from to this increase is primarily due to an increase in board fees  stock option compensation  salaries and employee benefits  insurance and accounting and legal fees 
the company incurred  of compensation expense related to its stock option plan 
in addition  the company has incurred increases in legal and accounting fees which are primarily due to the newly enacted sarbanes oxley and other regulatory compliance requirements 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in filing and servicing fees due to reduced rates 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  rental income decreased  or from to  due to the decline in the physical and economic occupancies of the properties 
rental concessions have significantly increased in order to attract and retain qualified tenants  and have reduced net effective rental rates 
the average effective annual rentals per unit of the company s multifamily apartment properties decreased from  in to  in real estate operating expenses  comprised principally of real estate taxes  property insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance  property management fees  and salaries and related employee expenses of on site employees  increased  or from to this increase includes approximately  in non recurring property tax expense 
during  the company was billed an additional  in taxes for prior years which had not been previously billed  all of which was recorded by the company during in addition  insurance expense increased approximately  due to significant increases in the premium rates for property insurance 
costs associated with increasing occupancy  such as advertising and marketing  also increased 
depreciation expense increased  or from to which is attributable to capital improvements of  made during interest and dividend income decreased  or from to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents 
the average interest rate during was compared to for this decrease was partially offset by dividend income earned on the company s corporate equity securities 
the company did not own any equity securities prior to the fourth quarter of and purchased  of additional securities during the company recorded a gain of  on its interest rate swap agreements in  compared to a gain of  recorded in such gains are due to changes in the estimated valuation of the agreements 
interest expense decreased  or from to which is due to the decline in the interest rate of the company s variable rate debt 
the average variable rate declined to in  compared to in approximately of the company s bonds and mortgage notes payable bear interest at variable rates as of december  amortization of debt financing costs decreased  or from to general and administrative expenses increased  or from to this increase is primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits and legal fees 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in filing and servicing fees due to reduced rates 
funds from operations the company generated funds from operations quot  ffo quot  of  in compared with  in the increase in ffo from to is primarily attributable to the gain on the repayment of the jefferson place subordinate note 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition of ffo that is recommended by the national association of real investment trust nareit 
to calculate ffo under the nareit definition  depreciation and amortization expenses related to the company s real estate  gains or losses realized from the disposition of real estate assets  and certain extraordinary items are added back to the company s net income 
the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company s operating performance because ffo excludes the depreciation expense on real estate assets 
while cost depreciation is recorded as an expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states quot  gaap quot  and  therefore  reduces gaap net income  the company believes that historical cost depreciation of real estate assets does not generally correlated with actual changes in the fair value of its real estate since the value of these assets does not necessarily decrease predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
while the company uses the nareit definition of ffo  the company s ffo may not be comparable to other reits or real estate companies with similar assets 
this is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on ffo 
real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time whereas real estate costs that are expensed are accounted for as a current period expense 
this affects ffo because costs that are accounted for as expenses reduce ffo 
conversely  real estate costs that are capitalized and depreciated are added back to net income to calculate ffo 
the company s capitalization policy is to treat most recurring capital improvements  such as appliances  vinyl flooring and carpet as expenses  and this may cause the company s reported ffo to be lower than peer companies that capitalize recurring improvements of these types 
although the company considers ffo to be a useful measure of its operating performance  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with gaap 
the following sets forth a reconciliation of the company s net income as determined in accordance with gaap and its ffo for the periods set forth 
liquidity and capital resources the company uses cash primarily to i nbsp  pay the operating expenses of its multifamily apartment properties  including the cost of capital improvements and fees paid to its property manager  ii nbsp  to pay the operating expenses of the company s administration  including the fees paid to its advisor  iii nbsp  the payment of debt service on its bonds and mortgages payable  iv the acquisition of additional multifamily apartment properties  agency securities and other investments  and v nbsp  the payment of dividends 
the company believes that net cash provided by operations will continue to be adequate in both the short and long term to meet operating requirements including recurring capital expenditures at its properties and the continued payment of dividends at the rate of per share per year 
however  if there is any significant further deterioration to the amount of net cash flow generated by the company s real estate investments  the company s may have to consider decreasing its dividend rate 
the company has the authority to finance the acquisition of additional real estate assets in a variety of manners  including raising additional equity capital  reinvestment of cash flow and borrowing 
in general  the company does not intend to use current cash flow as a primary method of financing acquisitions of additional real estate assets and does not intend to reduce dividend levels in order to finance property acquisitions 
if the company is able to complete the proposed merger with afrez it will have access to the uninvested capital of afrez and could apply some or all of this to the acquisition of additional properties  agency securities or other investments 
however  the amount of uninvested cash available to the company after the merger would be sufficient to allow the acquisition of only one additional apartment complex 
the company expects  however  that after the completion of the merger that it will be able to raise additional equity capital through an offering of additional shares of its common or preferred stock 
however  at this time the company has not entered into any underwriting agreements or other arrangements to do so and there is no assurance that it will be able to either complete the merger or raise additional equity capital after the merger 
in addition to the funds that the company may raise through the issuance of additional equity capital  it may also be able to borrow money to finance the acquisition of additional real estate assets 
borrowing to acquire additional multifamily apartment properties is generally in the form of long term taxable or tax exempt mortgage loans secured by the acquired properties 
the amount of debt the company can incur is not limited by its charter or otherwise 
in general  however  the amount of borrowing used to finance the overall multifamily apartment property portfolio is approximately to of the purchase price of these assets  although higher or lower levels of borrowings may be used on any single property 
the multifamily apartment properties which the company currently owns are financed under twelve mortgage financings with an aggregate principal balance of nbsp  million as of december nbsp  these mortgages consisted of ten tax exempt bonds with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of nbsp  million and two taxable mortgage notes payable with a combined principal balance of nbsp  million 
six of these mortgage obligations  totaling nbsp  million  require periodic payments of principal and interest  while the remaining six mortgage obligations require only semiannual payments of interest 
approximately of these mortgage obligations bear interest at a fixed rate with a weighted average of as of december nbsp  the remaining of these mortgage obligations bear interest at variable rates  via interest rate swap agreements  that had a weighted average interest rate of as of december nbsp  maturity dates on these mortgage oblig ations range from september to july each of these mortgage loans has been made on a nonrecourse basis  which means that the lender s source of payment in the event of a default is limited to foreclosure of the underlying property securing the mortgage loan 
acquisitions of agency securities are principally financed with repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements take the form of a sale of a security in this case  an agency security owned by the company to a counterparty at an agreed upon price in return for the counterparty s simultaneous agreement to resell the same securities back to the owner at a future date at a higher price 
although structured as a sale and repurchase obligation  a repurchase agreement operates as a borrowing under which the company pledges agency securities that it already owns as collateral to secure a short term loan with a counterparty 
the borrowings are then used to acquire additional agency securities  which themselves may be used as collateral for additional borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the difference between the sale and repurchase price is the cost  or interest expense  of borrowing under the repurchase agreements 
the repurchase agreements may require the company to pledge additional assets to the lender in the event the market value of existing pledged collateral declines below a specified percentage 
the pledged collateral may fluctuate in value due to  among other things  principal repayments  market changes in interest rates and credit quality 
the company retains beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral  including the right to distributions  while the counterparty maintains custody of the collateral securities 
at the maturity of a repurchase agreement  the company is required to repay the loan and concurrently receive back its pledged collateral from the lender or  may renew the repurchase agreement at the then prevailing financing rate 
as of december nbsp   the company had borrowed approximately million under short term repurchase agreements to finance its investment in agency securities 
these repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average maturity of nbsp  days 
total borrowings to acquire agency securities is currently l imited by the company to not more than eight times the amount of equity capital invested or set aside for investment by the company in agency securities  although the company can increase this limitation with the approval of the board of directors 
the company may use derivatives and other hedging strategies to help mitigate interest rate risks on the long term borrowings used to finance its properties and the prepayment and interest rate risks on its agency securities 
the company may use interest rate caps  interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to achieve these goals  but the timing and amount of hedging transactions  if any  will depend on numerous market conditions  including  but not limited to  the interest rate environment  management s assessment of the future changes in interest rates and the market availability and cost of entering into such hedge transactions 
in addition  management s ability to employ hedging strategies may be restricted by requirements for maintaining reit status 
management does not anticipate entering into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  is fairly consistent with cash used in investing activities increased  for the year compared to primarily due to acquisitions of mortgage backed securities of million  offset by cash proceeds received for the jefferson place subordinate note 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year increased  compared to primarily due to proceeds from borrowings under repurchase agreements of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
the company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationships with the company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations as of december  the company intends to renew its repurchase agreements which come due in with repurchase agreements having similar terms 
inflation substantially all of the resident leases at the company s multifamily apartment properties allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek rent increases 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation  however  market conditions may prevent the company from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on bonds and mortgage notes payable the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its long term borrowings used to fund expansion of the company s real estate portfolio 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and enters into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  in order to manage and mitigate its interest rate risk 
the company has not entered into derivative instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   approximately of the company s long term borrowings consisted of fixed rate financing 
the remaining consisted of variable rate financing obtained through interest rate swap transactions 
variations in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowing on its variable rate financing 
the interest rates payable by the company on these obligations increase or decrease with certain index interest rates 
if the company s borrowing costs increase  the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders will decrease 
had the average index rates increased or decreased by basis points during the year ended december   interest expense on the company s variable rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately  respectively 
the following table presents information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s borrowings the aggregate fair value of the company s borrowings was  as of december  and the estimated fair value of the swap agreements was  as of december  the  variable to fixed rate swap was entered into on top of and to mitigate the variable rate risk of the  fixed to variable swap 
it effectively fixes the interest rate on  of bonds payable at through as the above tables incorporate only those exposures or positions that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s risk mitigating strategies at that time and interest rates 
prepayment and reinvestment risk on mortgage backed securities as the company receives repayments of principal on its mortgage backed securities  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires mortgage backed securities at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mortgage backed securities or the par value of such mortgage backed securities if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s mortgage backed securities are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
cash concentrations of credit risk the company s cash and cash equivalents are deposited primarily in a trust account at a single financial institution and are not covered by the federal deposit insurance corporation
