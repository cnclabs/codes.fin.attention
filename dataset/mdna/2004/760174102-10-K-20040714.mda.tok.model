business trends our financial results for fiscal have been  and we expect them to continue to be for fiscal  affected by the changing dynamics in the home video and game rental market  as they impact our ppt business 
we continue to experience the impact of the migration from higher historical rentals of cassettes to greater rentals of dvds by our participating retailers 
we have successfully implemented new agreements with program suppliers to incorporate the availability of dvds  and we continue our efforts in fiscal to secure more dvd agreements to address this impact 
in addition  our ppt business continues to be affected by a shift to output programs under which the program supplier and we agree to a lower order processing and transaction fee in exchange for the participating retailers commitment to order an increased number of units of all the program supplier s titles 
the result is an increased number of units leased by the participating retailers  but a reduced amount of fees per unit earned by the program supplier and us 
these output programs are an economic response to the changing dynamics of the home video rental market  as a result of the migration from cassette format to the dvd format 
we expect the growth of these output programs to continue  and believe that they will be financially beneficial for the participating retailers  program suppliers and us 
our base of participating retailers continues to be strong 
we have one participating retailer that accounted for of the ppt revenues in fiscal the agreement with this participating retailer is scheduled to expire in september  with associated ppt revenues from that participating retailer s rentals expected to continue on a declining basis through the end of fiscal we are currently discussing with that participating retailer their interest in entering into a new agreement with us 
we are also implementing other strategies for obtaining other new participating retailers and program suppliers in an effort to further stabilize and grow our overall ppt revenue and earnings streams 
we continue to be in good standing with all of our program suppliers and we make on going efforts to enhance those business relationships through improvement of current services offered and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
we are also allocating significant efforts towards our business intelligence service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business intelligence software has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
we intend to continue to make the necessary increased investments in these new business intelligence services in the short term  affecting our current earnings 
we believe they will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and ultimately be the cornerstone of our long term success 
sources of revenue our sources of revenue include the following ppt revenue sharing fees in the entertainment business segment order processing fees generated when cassettes  dvds and video games units are ordered by and distributed to retailers  transaction fees generated when retailers rent units to consumers  sell through fees generated when retailers sell units to consumers  communication fees when retailers point of sale systems are connected to our information system  and buy out fees generated when retailers purchase units at the end of the lease term 
entertainment business segment revenues also include direct revenue sharing fees from data tracking and reporting services provided to program suppliers drs  revenues from box office essentials  supply chain essentials  business intelligence essentials  and home video essentials  all part of our essential business intelligence service offerings  as well as charges for internet services provided by our subsidiary  formovies 
com  inc in addition  through july   revenue included the fulfillment business segment representing charges to customers of our subsidiary pf 
com  inc pf  which provided order processing  fulfillment and inventory management services to internet retailers and wholesalers and other businesses requiring just in time fulfillment 
effective july   we sold pf s operating assets at its wilmington  ohio facility to a third party 
restatements in may and june  we discovered that we had misinterpreted and misapplied certain terms of some of our program supplier revenue sharing agreements 
these misinterpretations and misapplications resulted in the miscalculation of program supplier liabilities and related cost of sales and  therefore  net income loss 
there were two general types of misinterpretations or misapplications i over reporting cost of sales and related liabilities due to the misapplication of certain terms in our program supplier revenue sharing agreements in the amounts of million and million  respectively  in fiscal and  and ii under reporting cost of sales and overstating assets and understating liabilities due to the misuse of contract information in recognizing our guarantees to one program supplier in the amounts of million and million  respectively  in fiscal and however  there was no effect on the accuracy of amounts we have periodically remitted to our program suppliers under the terms of the revenue sharing agreements or on our reported cash balances 
accordingly  correction of these errors did not result in any additional payments to any of these suppliers 
also in june  we discovered that we were not accounting for certain order processing fees received from our customers upon street date  which is the date that they are able to rent the title pursuant to sop our previous method had been to recognize revenue on the shipment date 
this resulted in a restatement of revenue between periods 
in addition  in connection with the embezzlement of funds by an employee  as discussed in more detail below  we underreported our sales tax liability in fiscal we record our sales tax liabilities as an offset to revenue 
see item a controls and procedures for a discussion of changes made to our internal controls and to our processes and procedures to help ensure against such restatements in the future 
the restatements did not affect cash flows from operations  investing activities or financing activities in any fiscal year 
we also reclassified certain operating expense amounts to conform to the current fiscal year presentation

sale of pf 
com in june  we signed a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of pf at the wilmington  ohio operation for  the agreement covered all equipment and leasehold improvements at pf s leased distribution facility in wilmington  ohio  as well as a portion of its working capital 
as part of the agreement  pf  as lessee  and rentrak  as guarantor  were released from the lease 
the cash purchase price of  is approximately equal to the net book value of the assets sold 
we completed this asset sale transaction effective july   and received the cash purchase price in full 
the operations of pf have not been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  because cash flows related to our fulfillment activities have not been completely eliminated 
during the sale negotiations  we received notification from pf s largest customer  serviced exclusively from the leased distribution facility in columbus  ohio  that it did not intend to renew its fulfillment service contract upon the scheduled expiration at july  the columbus  ohio distribution facility was used exclusively to service this customer 
due to the timing of the notification  we were not able to include the columbus  ohio distribution facility lease in the asset sale transaction 
we completed the termination of the lease obligation for the columbus  ohio distribution facility  effective december   for a cost of  which is included as a component of cost of sales in our statement of operations 
this lease termination included the assignment of the sublease pf had in place with its former largest customer for approximately  square feet of this facility 
investigation and recovery efforts regarding misappropriated funds in march  we learned that an employee may have engaged in fraudulent activity and we hired an outside firm to investigate the matter 
the employee admitted to embezzling funds from us 
it was determined that the employee had been embezzling funds from us since through  in an amount totaling approximately  the investigation of this matter is complete 
other than  in underreported sales taxes as discussed above  the embezzlement funds were materially expensed in the year such funds were embezzled and  therefore  had no other effect on the restatement of any financial results in fiscal or prior years 
we are in the process of securing certain assets belonging to this employee  which  in conjunction with insurance proceeds  should provide us with recoveries of approximately  which will be recorded as recoveries in future periods when they are received 
we have incurred a total of approximately  to  of legal and other professional fees related to this matter through june  and expect to incur an additional amount of approximately  to  before the matter is resolved 
we have updated our system of internal controls  as described more fully in item a  in order to prevent such occurrences in the future

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  certain expenses were reclassified from selling and administrative to cost of sales in fiscal and revenue revenue decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in fulfillment pf revenue and order processing fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenues from transaction fees and from drs and our essential business service offerings  which are a component of other revenue 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the fact that  in fiscal  we earned royalties and other revenues from rentrak japan totaling million  which are included as a component of other revenue 
our arrangement with rentrak japan ended in fiscal order processing fees decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to ppt output programs and other ppt programs under which we agreed with the program supplier to charge a lower order processing and transaction fee in exchange for the participating retailers commitment to order an increased total number of units of all the program suppliers titles 
these programs began in august and were a response to the shift from the vhs cassette format to the dvd format 
these output programs  along with a new combined vhs dvd revenue sharing program with a new major supplier  contributed to an increase in total units shipped during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in order processing fees was offset in part by a million  or  increase in transaction fees and a million  or  increase in sell through fees 
the increase in transaction fees is primarily due to the increased number of units ordered by our participating retailers from our output programs that were rented to their customers 
the increase in sell through fees is primarily due to the new combined vhs dvd revenue sharing program noted above 
we expect our sell through revenue increases to continue as the result of changed terms and conditions in our new product programs 
fulfillment revenues decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  due to ceasing pf operations as of july  as discussed above 
increases in other revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal included an increase of approximately million in drs revenues to million in fiscal and an increase of million in revenues from our essential business intelligence services offerings to million in fiscal in fiscal  there were minimal revenues generated from our essential business intelligence services as they began in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily relates to million of royalties received related to rentrak japan in fiscal in connection with its sale  compared to none in fiscal  and a million decrease in drs revenues 
order processing fee revenue decreased to million  a decrease of million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal and transaction fee revenue decreased to million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the same periods 
these decreases resulted primarily from the output and other ppt programs discussed above 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sell through revenue to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of order processing costs  transaction costs  sell through costs and handling and freight costs  and represents the direct costs to produce revenues 
order processing costs  transaction costs and sell through costs represent the amounts due the program suppliers that hold the distribution rights to the units 
freight costs represent the cost to pick  pack and ship orders of units to the participating retailers 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal a majority of the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to ceasing operations of pf in july in addition  approximately million of the total cost of sales decrease is attributable to the overall million decrease in ppt revenues 
cost of sales in fiscal includes a  charge related to costs of terminating pf s columbus  ohio  facility lease 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to approximately million in revenues from our essential business service offerings in fiscal  with million of related cost of sales  compared to million of revenue and million of costs from these offerings in fiscal in addition  the decrease is due to the receipt of million of discretionary rebates from one of our program suppliers during fiscal  related to guarantee shortages resulting from under performance of certain titles 
we received million of such rebates during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by the  charge related to pf discussed above 
the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the lack of royalty fees related to rentrak japan in fiscal  compared to million of such royalties in fiscal  and a  increase in warrant amortization 
we expensed the remaining unamortized value of warrants previously issued to a customer in conjunction with a service agreement as of march  based on the expectation that the customer would not be utilizing our services in future periods 
selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits  development  marketing and advertising costs  legal and professional fees  communications costs  depreciation and amortization of tangible fixed assets and software  real and personal property leases  as well as other general corporate expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase of approximately million related to the continued investment toward the development and operating growth in our essential business service offerings noted above 
in addition  we had a million decrease in advertising credits received from our program suppliers in fiscal compared to fiscal and our bad debt expense increased million in the same period due to fewer charge backs to our program suppliers under our current contractual arrangements 
these increases were partially offset by an approximately million decrease attributable to ceasing pf s operations july  the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in compensation  advertising  and travel and entertainment expenses related to our pf business  as we continued to adjust our overhead infrastructure to better match the related revenues 
in addition  in fiscal compared to fiscal  we had a million increase in advertising credits  a million increase in bad debt charge backs to our program suppliers and a million decrease in other miscellaneous costs 
net gain on litigation settlement the net gain on litigation settlement of  in fiscal relates to an amount that hollywood entertainment  a former customer  agreed to pay us in order to resolve all outstanding issues 
the net gain on litigation settlement of million in fiscal relates to a settlement with hollywood entertainment for breach of a fulfillment contract 
asset impairment in  we determined that it was unlikely that pf would achieve its business plans and we initiated a plan to sell the assets of pf 
prior to march   it was determined that  more likely than not  substantially all of pf s assets would be sold or otherwise disposed of 
as a result of this determination  during the quarter ended march   we assessed the current and historical operating and cash flow losses  prospects for growth in revenues and other alternatives for improving the operating results of pf 
we then performed an assessment of the fair value of the pf assets under the guidelines of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
this assessment resulted in pf recognizing an asset impairment charge during the three month period ended march  in the amount of  for the write down of its assets to estimated fair market value of approximately  other income expense interest income of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  includes  and  of interest earned on the note receivable due from one of pf s clients  which was issued in june see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the  loss on investments in fiscal includes a  loss related to the write off of an unrealizable investment made by our pf business in a former customer 
the million gain on rentrak japan transactions includes million related to the sale of pf stock to rentrak japan  million related to the sale of our entire interest in rentrak japan stock and  related to forgiveness of liabilities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  respectively  in fiscal  and the tax rate in fiscal was positively affected primarily by the benefit of tax intangible amortization 
in addition  our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory tax rate due to state income taxes 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operations of blowout video  which consisted of retail store operations for the sale of used units 
due to the significant increase in sell through activity throughout the industry  the operations of blowout video did not meet our expectations  and  as a result  during fiscal  we initiated and completed a plan to discontinue the retail store operations of blowout video 
the plan called for an exit from the stores by the end of fiscal  either through cancellation of the lease commitments and liquidation of assets  or through sale of the stores to a third party 
as of march   all operations had ceased 
in january  we were notified by the purchaser of a portion of blowout video s operations of their intent to default on a note receivable due to us 
as such  we provided an approximate million reserve for the remaining balance of this note receivable in the three month period ended december  this reserve resulted in a reported loss  net of tax benefit  from these discontinued operations of  or per share in fiscal we are continuing to sell our contractually available end of term ppt revenue sharing product through broker channels 
current and prior year amounts have been restated to classify the results of blowout video operations  net of related tax effects  as discontinued 
the results of operations related to blowout video were as follows year ended march  revenue   net loss    net loss per share the decrease in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to operating only three stores during fiscal compared to seven stores in fiscal inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include our cash balance  cash generated from operations and our million line of credit 
based on our current budget and projected cash needs  we believe that our available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our current operations  the continued development of our business intelligence services and other cash requirements to at least march  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at march   compared to million at march  this decrease resulted primarily from million used in operations and million used for the purchase of property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of pf  million of payments received on a note receivable from pf s former largest customer  and million of proceeds related to the issuance of stock pursuant to our stock plans 
our current ratio was at march  compared to at march  accounts receivable increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  this increase is primarily due to changes in the terms of various combined vhs dvd revenue sharing agreements  together with an increase in the number of units rented 
advances to program suppliers increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to the timing of release dates for certain titles and the addition of a new program supplier 
these amounts represent the unearned portion of guarantees with certain program suppliers 
deferred tax assets  short and long term  were million at march  compared to million at march  the deferred tax asset balance primarily relates to net operating loss carryforwards and various reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
other current assets decreased million to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to a decline in pre paid expenses and decreased deferred costs due to a lower average order processing fee per unit 
during fiscal  we spent million on property and equipment  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business intelligence service offerings 
these additions were offset by the sale of approximately  book value of assets related to pf 
we anticipate spending approximately million on property and equipment in fiscal  including million for the capitalization of internally developed software for our business intelligence service offerings 
other long term assets decreased million to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to a  write off of a security deposit related to pf s columbus facility  million associated with principal payments received on a note receivable from a former customer of pf and the establishment of a  reserve for the remaining balance of a note receivable related to the blowout video store sale 
accounts payable increased million to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to the timing of program supplier and other vendor payments 
accrued liabilities decreased  to million at march  compared to million at march  primarily due to a  reduction in directors and officers insurance premiums and a  credit at march  due a participating retailer that was fully earned in fiscal we currently have a secured revolving line of credit for million  which expires september  we expect to renew this line prior to its expiration under similar terms 
interest on the line of credit is at our choice of either the bank s prime interest rate minus percent or libor plus percent 
the credit line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the terms of the credit agreement include certain financial covenants requiring a consolidated net loss for the fiscal quarter ended september   not to exceed million  a consolidated net profit to be achieved each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended december  of a minimum of  and consolidated net profit not less than on an annual basis  determined at fiscal year end  and achievement of specified current and leverage financial ratios 
based upon the financial results reported as of and for the fiscal year ended march   we determined that we were in compliance with the financial covenants as of march  at march   we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  is as follows payments due by fiscal period contractual obligation total and and and beyond capital leases    operating leases    program supplier guarantees   executive compensation    critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and program supplier reserves we have entered into guarantee contracts with certain program suppliers providing titles for distribution under our ppt system 
these contracts guarantee the program suppliers minimum payments that are recoupable based on revenue sharing activity 
in some cases  these guarantees are paid in advance 
for amounts not paid in advance  we record a liability for the gross amount of the guarantee due to the program supplier on the street date in accordance with sop the unearned portion of the guarantees is included as advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
using historical experience and year to date rental experience for each title  we estimate the projected revenue to be generated under each guarantee 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate shortages after to days of rental activity 
we then establish a reserve for titles that are projected to experience a shortage under the provisions of the guarantee 
we continually review these factors and make adjustments to the reserves as needed 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could have a material effect on the recorded program supplier reserves 
the balance in this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at march  and deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets totaled million and million  respectively  as of march  and new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at that date revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits 
we utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
