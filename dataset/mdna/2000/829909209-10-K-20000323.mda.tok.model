at december   sipex has us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income 
these losses expire during the years through as of december   utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation of approximately million as a result of an ownership change which occurred on september  sipex anticipates that the available funds and cash provided from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
factors affecting future results from time to time  information provided by sipex  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including in this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and releases of the securities and exchange commission 
in particular  certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated availability of capital for working capital and for capital expenditures constitute forward looking statements 
sipex s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the other risks discussed in sipex s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
sipex s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  availability of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  sipex s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by sipex s competitors  market acceptance of sipex s and its customers products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  the ability of sipex to manufacture in the correct mix to respond to orders on hand and new orders received in the future  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  sipex typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
because sipex is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  operating results would be adversely affected if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  sipex is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  sipex may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could substantially harm its business  financial condition and operating results 
supply and manufacturing risks in an effort to reduce sipex s reliance on outside fabricators for its wafers  sipex has built an in house fabrication facility in milpitas  california 
sipex is in the process of bringing wafer production in house and transitioning certain products to the new fab 
sipex may experience unexpected delays and problems in qualifying and ramping up production at this new facility 
the failure of sipex to implement the new fab successfully and in a timely fashion may impact future revenue growth and operating results 
sipex currently relies on three outside foundries to supply fully processed semiconductor wafers 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
sipex is also subject to significant manufacturing risks including yield variances which sipex or its outside foundries may experience 
the occurrence of any of these problems would negatively impact sipex s business and results of operations 
expected benefits from the merger with calogic sipex completed the merger with calogic with the expectation that the merger would result in certain benefits  including cost savings related to the elimination of redundant activities  the opportunity to generate revenue from new customers  operating efficiencies such as combined managerial  sales  marketing and technological expertise and personnel  and other synergies due to the strategic fit and compatibility of the two companies  including their common equipment platforms and information systems 
we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
integrating calogic s operations and personnel with our business has been and continues to be a complex and difficult process 
achieving the benefits of the merger will depend upon the successful integration of calogic s business in an efficient and timely manner 
the integration of calogic with our operations could require additional costs and expenses as well as demands on management personnel 
the diversion of the attention of our management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining our companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in our activities 
further  we may experience customer  supplier or employee attrition as a result of the merger 
we cannot assure you that the merger will be accretive to net income at any point in the future 
intellectual property rights sipex relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of these intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of these rights could negatively impact sipex s business and results of operations 
dependence on new products sipex s success will depend upon its ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have such products selected for design into new products of its customers 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields and market acceptance of sipex s and its customers products 
competition the semiconductor industry sipex competes with several domestic semiconductor companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources and broader product lines than sipex 
sipex believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the breadth of its product line  the ability to develop and introduce new products rapidly  product innovation  product quality and reliability  product performance  price  technical service and support  adequacy of manufacturing quality and capacity and sources of raw materials  efficiency of production  delivery capabilities and protection of sipex s products by intellectual property laws 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and is subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
sipex may experience substantial period to period fluctuation in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions and overall economic conditions 
international sales sipex derives a significant portion of its net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting sipex s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that recent economic troubles in certain asian countries will not have a material adverse effect on sipex s business  results of operations and financial condition 
stock price volatility the trading price of sipex s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by sipex or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of sipex s common stock 
year readiness disclosure statement sipex did not experience any interruption to its business activities or incur any impairment to its financial condition or results of operations as a result of passing into calendar year sipex will continue to monitor its own internal systems and products to determine the impact  if any  of problems associated with the year to date  year costs are not considered by sipex to be material to the company s financial condition nor has sipex incurred any significant unplanned expenditures to address or remediate year problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sipex owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve sipex s capital until it is required to fund operations  including sipex s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
sipex does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
investment rate risk sipex s investment portfolio includes debt instruments that are primarily united states government bonds of less than one year in duration 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
sipex s investment portfolio also consists of certain commercial paper which is also subject to interest rate risk 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  sipex does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
