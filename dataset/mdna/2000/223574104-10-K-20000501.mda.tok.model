environmental matters the registrant is not a party to any legal proceedings or the subject of any claim regarding environmental matters generally incidental to its business 
in the opinion of management  compliance with the present environmental protection laws should not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the registrant item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the registrant s cash and investments exceed long term debt  therefore  the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the marketable securities held by the registrant 
the registrant only invests in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
the company does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
the company also maintains long term debt at fixed rates 
due to the nature and amounts of the registrant s note payable  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect in the registrant s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
the registrant s exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is also immaterial to the consolidated statements as a whole
