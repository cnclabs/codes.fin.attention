such factors include  among others  i changes in general economic and business conditions that affect demand for computer numeric control cnc systems  machine tools and software products  ii changes in manufacturing markets  iii innovations by competitors  iv quality and delivery performance by our contract manufacturers and v governmental actions and initiatives including import and export restrictions and tariffs 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charge credit operating income interest expense net income fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ending october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share  for the preceding year 
results for fiscal are not comparable to the preceding period because fiscal results include a million restructuring charge and million of license fees and litigation settlements net of expenses and foreign withholding taxes 
as discussed below  net license fee income and litigation settlements fees for fiscal were  sales and service fees were million for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in sales was due in part to the negative impact of a stronger us dollar when converting foreign sales to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
at constant exchange rates  net sales and service fees for fiscal would have been million 
sales of computerized machine systems  before foreign currency translation effects were substantially unchanged from the prior year and accounted for of our annual sales and service fees 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal decreased by million  or  reflecting very weak market conditions that have existed since the third quarter of fiscal sales of computerized machine systems in europe increased million  or  in fiscal on a constant dollar basis  while sales in southeast asia increased million 
the increase in international sales was offset in part by approximately million negative effect from foreign currency translation 
sales of stand alone cnc systems and software declined by million  or 
the decline in stand alone cnc systems was primarily the result of an anticipated reduction in shipments to original equipment manufacturers oems and retrofit dealers of stand alone cnc systems  primarily related to our deltatm series cnc systems  as we have repositioned these products as components of integrated machine systems 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal orders for the year were million compared to million in the prior year  a million  or  decrease 
computerized machine system orders increased million  or  while stand alone cnc system orders decreased million  or 
computerized machine system unit orders in europe increased while orders in the united states declined 
offsetting the increase in computerized machine system orders in europe was a decline in stand alone cnc system unit orders of 
the decline in orders for stand alone cnc systems is the result of our repositioning these products for marketing as components of integrated computerized machine systems 
backlog was million at october  and million at october  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of lower service margin and the effects of a stronger dollar relative to foreign currencies 
interest expense for fiscal increased  or from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to increased borrowing to support an increase in finished product inventory which began in the second half of fiscal license fee income and litigation settlement fees for fiscal were  compared to million in the prior year 
as previously reported  there are a limited number of cnc users that are not already licensed and most of the licenses previously granted provided for a single lump sum payment at the time of grant 
as a result  license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal were not expected to equal that recorded in fiscal for further information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal is primarily related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the fiscal provision was favorably impacted by a  tax asset recorded by a foreign subsidiary due to a change in its tax status 
the provision for foreign income taxes in fiscal consisted of  of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees and approximately million related to the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a german tax examiner has contested our transfer of net operating losses between two of our german subsidiaries that merged in fiscal the contingent tax liability resulting from this issue is approximately million 
we have protested this matter and have not yet received a ruling from the german tax authorities on the tax examiner s finding and our protest 
in the event an unfavorable ruling is received from the german tax authorities  we will consider whether to appeal to the german federal tax court 
no provision for the contingency has been recorded 
fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ending october  was million  or per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share  for the preceding year 
included in results was a million restructuring charge which is more fully discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income in fiscal and also included million and million  respectively  of license fees and litigation settlements net of expenses and foreign withholding taxes 
excluding the restructuring charge and net license fee and litigation settlements  net income in fiscal would have been million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or 
per share  in fiscal in addition  the provision for income taxes in fiscal increased by  or  primarily the result of the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
sales and service fees were million for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in sales for the fiscal year was due in part to the negative impact of a stronger us dollar during the first three fiscal quarters  when converting foreign sales to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
at constant exchange rates  net sales and service fees for the fiscal year would have been million 
sales of computerized machine systems  before foreign currency translation effects  increased million  or  for fiscal and accounted for of our annual sales and service fees 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal approximated the fiscal level while sales in the united kingdom  which experienced unfavorable economic conditions  declined million  or 
sales of computerized machine systems in continental europe  primarily germany and france  increased million  or  in fiscal also contributing to the increase in computerized machine systems was our offering of a new milling machine featuring a fully integrated delta tm cnc system sold under the dynapath tm name and our press brake system sold with a fully integrated autobend r cnc system 
both computerized machine systems were released for sale in the second half of fiscal the increase in sales of computerized machine systems was offset by a million  or  decline in sales of stand alone cnc systems 
the decline in stand alone cnc systems was the result of reduced shipments to original equipment manufacturers oems and retrofit dealers of stand alone cnc systems  primarily related to our delta tm series cnc systems  as we reposition these products for marketing as components of integrated machine systems 
service income declined by approximately  or  as a result of our on going transfer of customer servicing responsibility to certain of our distributors as well as improved quality of the computerized machine systems 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal orders for the year were million compared to million in the prior year  a million  or  decrease 
computerized machine system orders increased million  or  while stand alone cnc system orders decreased million  or 
computerized machine system unit orders in continental europe principally germany france increased while orders in the united states and england declined reflecting weaker demand in those markets 
offsetting the increase in computerized machine system orders was a decline in stand alone cnc system orders units of 
the decline in orders for stand alone cnc systems is the result of our repositioning these products for marketing as components of integrated computerized machine systems 
backlog was million at october  and million at october  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of reduced costs of computerized machine systems produced by our contract manufacturers in taiwan due to the weakening of the new taiwan dollar in fiscal also contributing to the improved margin was an increased mix of higher margin european sales 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal totaling million related to our subsidiary autocon technologies  inc ati 
ati historically marketed its delta tm series of cnc systems to oems and through retro fit dealers 
throughout fiscal  we repositioned ati to market its cnc products as components of fully integrated computerized machine systems under the dynapath tm brand name 
the first of several planned models of the dynapath tm machine systems product line was successfully launched in fiscal resulting in sales of  the decline in oem controls sales  concurrent with a decline in demand for retro fit cnc systems and inventory write downs  resulted in operating losses related to ati  before restructuring charges  of million for the fiscal year ended october  as discussed above  in october  we initiated a more comprehensive restructuring of ati s business to include consolidation of operations  contract manufacturing of cnc systems in taiwan  simplification of the cnc product offering and cancellation of certain product development projects  as well as rationalizing the sales and customer service activities 
this restructuring program  which was in the first half of fiscal  resulted in a million restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge was comprised of approximately  of reserves for the write down of fixed assets and  of accrued liabilities for employee severance costs and obligations under lease of manufacturing and office space that will no longer be used 
interest expense for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to debt reduction in fiscal combined with the full year effect of the million debt reduction that occurred in fiscal license fee income and litigation settlement fees for fiscal  represented of income before taxes compared to in fiscal and was attributable almost entirely to licenses entered into during the year by ims 
as of october   license fees of approximately  net of legal fees and expenses  have been deferred and are expected to be recognized through fiscal there are a limited number of remaining cnc users that ims has identified as potential licensees 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that future license fee income and litigation settlement fees will equal that recorded in fiscal for further information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal consisted of approximately  of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees and approximately million related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the provision for foreign income taxes in fiscal consisted almost entirely of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
euro currency many of the countries in which we sell our products and services are member states of the economic and monetary union emu 
beginning january   member states of the emu were permitted to begin trading in either their local currencies or the euro  the official currency of emu participating member states 
parties are free to choose the unit they prefer in contractual relationships during the transitional period  beginning january and ending june our computer system contains the functionality to process transactions in either a country s local currency or the euro 
we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any material adverse effects on our operations related to the emu s conversion to the euro 
however  there can be no assurance that the conversion of emu member states to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
foreign currency risk management we manage our foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
we also moderate our currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
the results of these programs achieved our objectives in fiscal and fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year compliance we did not experience any interruptions in our operations from yk related matters 
the amount spent on yk testing and remediation was not material 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash used for operations totaled  in fiscal  compared to cash provided by operations of million in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was enhanced by receipts of approximately million of license fees  net of legal fees and taxes 
working capital was million at october   compared to million at october  the working capital increase is attributable to a decrease in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses of  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts payable relates primarily to payments made to our contract manufacturers for inventory purchases that occurred in late fiscal under terms that generally range from to days 
accounts payable at october  reflected a higher than normal level of shipments from our contract manufacturers in the fourth fiscal quarter 
capital investments for the fiscal year ended october  consisted principally of expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
cash used for investing activities during the year was funded by cash flow from operations and bank credit facilities 
we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock during fiscal and  respectively  under our previously announced stock repurchase program 
these shares are reflected as a reduction of common stock outstanding in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share 
total debt at october  was million  representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or  of total capitalization at october  we were in compliance with all loan covenants at october  we believe that anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our bank line of credit is affected by the general level of us and european interest rates and or libor 
however  we only had million outstanding under our bank line of credit at october  and the effect of interest rate changes would likely not be significant 
foreign currency exchange risk a significant portion of our product content is sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by contract manufacturers overseas 
our contractual arrangements with those suppliers typically include foreign currency risk sharing agreements which reduce the effects of currency fluctuations on product cost 
the predominant portion of foreign currency exchange rate risk regarding product cost relates to the new taiwan dollar 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all computerized machine systems  cnc systems and certain proprietary service parts are sourced by a central engineering and manufacturing division of the us parent company and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
the parent company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to inter company sales and inter company accounts receivable in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes
