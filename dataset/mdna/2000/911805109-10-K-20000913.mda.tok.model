item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the contracts are negotiated on a turnkey or time and materials basis  depending on the project and the customer s needs 
usecc contracts with the operator of the wells  usecc does not act as the operator on any of the services wells or projects 
the largest customer in fiscal was jm huber  inc  representing  of use s gross revenues and of its net revenues from all contract drilling and construction operations 
due to the expected continued growth in the cbm play in wyoming and montana  the amount of business done by use s contract services business in fiscal could continue at the same or improved levels in fiscal  if rmg and quantum start developing substantial numbers of cbm wells on their acreage position 
see below 
rocky mountain gas  inc 
rmg was formed by use and crested as an independent energy company to engage in the acquisition  exploration  development  production and exploitation of cbm  for its own account 
it is expected that usecc will provide support services in cbm property development by rmg for rmg s own account  and may also provide competitive services to develop wells on acreage held by rmg and quantum see below 
compression of the coalbed methane gas in order for it to be fed into a pipeline and pipeline construction  is presently planned to be contracted out to others seeking to buy gas production 
cbm wells in the powder river basin are generally to feet deep  typically take three to ten days to drill and complete and cost between   per well 
in comparison to conventional oil and gas wells  powder river basin coalbed methane wells can generally be characterized by their low cost and short drilling time frame 
rmg intends to continue acquiring cbm acreage 
while the costs to acquire leasehold interests in the powder river basin have increased  rmg believes that attractive lease acquisition opportunities are still available 
in fiscal  rmg acquired from quantum energy llc an undivided working interest wi and net revenue interest nri in approximately  net mineral acres of coalbed methane leases located in the powder river basin of southeastern montana 
see the quantum agreement below 
with this acquisition  rmg became one of the larger holders of gas leases in this area 
the gas collection systems and related equipment associated with these wells may be furnished by rmg or provided by a third party transmission company at a negotiated price per thousand cubic feet mcf of gas transported in the pipeline 
the produced and gathered gas would then be sold into a transmission company s pipeline 
in addition to the acreage held with quantum  rmg has acquired approximately  net acres of other coalbed methane prospects in wyoming 
see below 
rmg presently does not have any proved developed or undeveloped gas reserves 
rmg plans to drill a total of coalbed methane wells in fiscal and quantum also plans to drill an additional wells in which rmg will have a working interest 
attaining these objectives will depend on when and where on rmg s acreage in wyoming and montana the necessary drilling permits can be obtained  see cbm permits below 
rmg and quantum have identified over drilling locations on state and fee portions of the acreage 
the actual number of wells to be drilled in fiscal and will depend on future operating results  availability of capital  the prevailing price of methane gas  and issuance of permits 
to fund startup operations and acquire acreage interests from quantum energy llc  rmg sold  shares of restricted common stock at per share to accredited investors including use and yellow stone fuels corp 
for net proceeds of   was paid in offering expenses and commissions to a registered broker dealer for placement services on sales to investors other than use and yellow stone fuels corp these shares are in addition to the initial shares acquired by use and employees of the companies on the formation of rmg 
additional capital from institutions and or joint ventures with industry partners is needed in fiscal and to begin fully exploiting the cbm acreage 
see item the quantum agreement 
rmg s largest prospects are the castle rock kirby prospects in southeast montana consisting of approximately  net mineral acres jointly owned with quantum 
rmg acquired a working interest wi and net revenue interest nri  on these properties under an agreement with quantum  which closed on january  rmg and quantum are also currently negotiating to acquire additional acres in their area of mutual interest ami of the powder river basin in montana 
under the quantum agreement  the ultimate purchase price is  of which  was paid on january  and  was paid on may  a payment of  is due on or before december  if rmg fails to pay the last purchase installment of  on or before december   rmg must assign of its undivided wi in the properties back to quantum 
at quantum s sole option  it may elect to have rmg drill and complete additional wells for the equivalent cost of  if quantum exercises this option  rmg would own a wi nri in the wells drilled with those funds  but only after quantum has received  in net revenues payback from those wells 
the acreage held with quantum is all in montana  and includes  net acres of blm land   net acres of state land montana  and  net acres of fee land 
a separate provision in the quantum agreement requires rmg to spend  to drill and complete cbm wells  as identified and agreed to by the operating company powder river gas  llc see below 
quantum will have a carried working interest in these wells  which means that rmg must pay all of the drilling and completion costs for these wells  after production begins  the net revenue interest will be split to rmg and to quantum  and operating costs will be split to rmg and to quantum 
rmg will not be entitled to recover any of the drilling and completion costs for these wells 
if rmg does not spend  to drill and complete the wells by november   and quantum spends part or all of that amount of funds to drill and complete wells on the acreage  then rmg will have the right until november  in effect to buy back its wi for an amount equal to quantum s expenditures  plus quantum s cost of funds if borrowed 
quantum will hold of the wi and the full nri until such time as rmg buys back its wi in the subject wells 
if rmg buys back its wi  quantum would hold a nri  and a working interest in the subject wells until two years after rmg buys back its working interest 
in this period of time  rmg would hold a wi but only a nri from the subject wells 
after two years from the buy back date  rmg would hold a net revenue interest in production from the subject wells  rmg would maintain its wi starting with its buy back date 
in addition  the quantum agreement calls for rmg and quantum to drill and complete a total of an additional wells between january  and december   subject to force majeure 
each party shall pay of the wells drilling and completion costs during the year  for a net revenue interest to each party 
neither rmg nor quantum will have a carried interest in any of these wells 
instead  in the event that either quantum or rmg elects not to drill the wells during the year  then the party who elects to drill the wells shall recover the funds advanced by it to pay for the other party s share of costs to drill and complete the wells  plus a penalty 
until the paying party recovers its costs plus the penalty  the paying party will hold of the working interest and the full ie  net revenue interest 
after such recovery of advances and penalty  the non consenting party will own its working interest and net revenue interest 
this penalty provision shall also apply to all future years between the parties as to wells not equally participated in on the quantum acreage 
the rmg quantum properties will be operated through powder river gas  llc  a wyoming limited liability company owned by rmg and by quantum 
cbm well sites will be selected from the acreage as approved by a management committee in which quantum and rmg have equal representation  drilling  completion and gathering system costs will be authorized by the committee and funded by rmg and quantum according to their interests in the acreage as determined by the agreement with quantum 
usecc has the right to provide drilling services on the first wells drilled by powder river gas  llc based on competitive drilling rates in the areas surrounding the wells to be drilled 
thereafter  usecc will have the right to submit bids on a competitive basis to powder river gas llc for drilling contracts on additional acreage 
rmg plans to operate a majority  if not all of the powder river basin properties it owns outside the quantum acreage 
permitting drilling cbm wells requires obtaining permits from various governmental agencies 
the ease of obtaining the necessary permits depends on the type of mineral ownership and the state in which the property is located 
intermittent delays in the permitting process can reasonably be expected throughout the development of any play 
for example  there is currently a temporary moratorium for drilling cbm wells on fee and state lands in montana 
rmg may shift its strategy as needed to drill in different parts of the cbm play or drill conventional shallow natural gas wells in order to evaluate all formations  including coal  for gas potential and expedite production capabilities 
as with all governmental permit processes  there is no assurance that permits will be issued in a timely fashion or in a form consistent with rmg s anticipated operations 
on march   the northern plains resource council  inc nprc filed suit against the montana board of oil and gas conservation requesting an order of the court compelling the defendant to prepare a supplemental environmental impact statement eis for coalbed methane development  which could further delay development 
rmg and others have filed a motion to intervene to participate in this litigation and to ensure that drilling can be performed during any environmental analysis 
the case is pending 
the wyodak environmental impact statement eis for the powder river basin in wyoming was issued in the fall of  which allowed the permitting of  cbm wells to be drilled on federal lands in wyoming 
more cbm well applications have been submitted causing the blm to begin a second eis for the powder river basin area in wyoming that will include cbm and conventional oil and gas wells 
this new eis is scheduled to commence in early summer and continue for to months 
development on federal lands in wyoming has been stopped with the balance of the wyodak eis permitted wells  occurring on fee and state lands 
blm has started an ea reviewing drainage issues which could allow an additional  new cbm well permits in the same region 
this was scheduled for scoping in early april with completion expected the following october 
again  there is no assurance that the ea and eis will not negatively impact rmg s business or operations 
in addition  the wyoming and montana departments of environmental quality have regulations applying to the surface disposal of water produced from cbm drilling operations 
cbm operators are currently seeking changes in permit requirements and department policy that would allow operators more flexibility to discharge water on the surface 
if these changes are not made  it may be necessary to install and operate treatment facilities or drill disposal wells to reinject the produced water back into the underground rock formations adjacent to the coal seams or lower sandstone horizons 
if rmg is unable to obtain the appropriate permits or if applicable laws or regulations require water to be disposed of in an alternative manner  the costs to dispose produced water will likely increase 
these costs could have a material effect on operations in this area  including potentially rendering future production and development in the affected areas uneconomic 
in montana  rmg has pending applications to the blm for approximately permits to drill into shallow gas sand formations on federal land held with quantum  these permits are expected to be issued in september  and may be converted to production status upon receiving approval from the montana board of oil and gas 
these wells would evaluate potential cbm production as well as conventional gas 
regarding other land held with quantum in montana  the state of montana may lift its moratorium for cbm wells on private and state ground in montana  and start issuing new permits on these lands in october a voluntary moratorium is currently in place for wells on private and state ground in montana 
rmg has not determined to what extent it will participate in this procedure  and is evaluating how best to protect its position to have reasonable exploration for cbm wells proceed on state and fee ground 
as approximately of rmg s acreage in the castle rock prospect in montana held with quantum is on federal land  rmg expects to have ample acreage permitted by the blm by late calendar to begin drilling and evaluating gas potential in both shallow sands and coal formations 
these favorable outcomes are predicted but not assured 
gathering and transmission of cbm gas companies involved in cbm production generally outsource their gas gathering  compression and transmission 
rmg intends to outsource its compression and gathering needs as well  possibly on a competitive basis with transmission companies in the immediate area 
negotiations with various transmission companies have been initiated by rmg in order to better manage future capital investment  but no contracts have been signed to date 
coalbed methane production growth in the powder river basin has historically been impeded by a shortage of gathering system capacity and transport capacity out of the basin 
however  two large diameter gathering pipelines were completed in september and a third was ready for service in early the two completed pipelines will provide an additional million cubic feet  or mmcf  of daily gas capacity as set forth below fort union gas gathering  llc s mile  gathering pipeline  commenced operations september   with an initial capacity of mmcf per day  thunder creek gas services  llc s mile  gathering pipeline  commenced operations september   with an initial capacity of mmcf per day  and additionally  cms energy s mile  big horn gas gathering pipeline  that connects to the northern terminus of the fort union pipeline  is continuing to be expanded in length and has an initial capacity of mmcf per day which can readily be upgraded to mmcf per day with the addition of booster compression 
further  on june   big horn gas gathering announced the extension of its pipeline to serve producers in the sheridan area 
this mile extension will place a high pressure pipeline within miles of the montana border and within close proximity to the development planned by rmg and quantum in their kirby prospect area 
wyoming interstate gas company s mile  medicine bow lateral pipeline commenced operations in november with an initial capacity of mmcf per day 
this pipeline will transport natural gas from the thunder creek and fort union pipelines at the south end of the powder river basin to interconnect with multiple interstate pipelines accessing markets to the east and along the front range of colorado 
this system is already being expanded as demand for transportation space grows 
further transmission lines are being planned by other companies in the area 
powder river basin properties 
as of june   rmg owned a working interest in oil and gas leases covering approximately  net acres in the powder river basin in montana 
these leases generally have two to ten year primary terms 
the federal leases are generally ten year term leases and newly acquired fee and state leases are generally two to five year term leases 
there are five separate project areas as follows castle rock 
this property consists of approximately  net acres of leases held jointly with quantum located in powder river county  west of broadus  montana 
additional properties in this area are under negotiation 
the castle rock prospect covers a large area and there are four separate prospective areas otter creek  kirby  bartholemew and castle rock areas 
coals present in the castle rock prospect are in the tongue river member of the fort union formation 
coalbed methane production in the wyoming portion of the powder river basin is also from the tongue river member coals 
coals of primary interest are the sawyer  knobloch and flowers goodale coals 
other coals present in the prospect area include the pawnee  brewster arnold  terret and stag coals 
gas shows from the sawyer  knobloch  and flowers goodale coals have been noted in several shallow water wells drilled in the area 
the apparent character  quality and gassiness of rmg project coals in the castle rock project appear comparable to the coals in cbm projects by other operators located near the montana wyoming border area in johnson and campbell counties  wyoming 
an initial permitting and drilling program in this area began in late and  to date  three holes have been completed 
coals encountered in the first drill test are outlined in the following table coal depth thickness pawnee feet feet brewster feet feet sawyer feet feet knobloch feet feet flowers goodale feet feet misc other coals various feet total coal feet kirby this lease block contains approximately  net acres held jointly with quantum located in big horn and rosebud counties  montana  north of sheridan  wyoming 
additional property in the area is being considered for acquisition 
the prospect is located in the northwestern portion of the powder river basin 
coalbed methane production has been established south of the prospect at another field which is currently being developed by redstone gas partners 
redstone recently received discharge permits from the montana deq to discharge up to  gallons per minute into the tongue river 
redstone has production with active locations in the field at this time 
pennaco energy is planning to drill several wells on a prospect east of the field 
petco is reportedly planning a well test project offsetting project acreage 
several coal seams are present in the prospect area with total coal thickness of approximately feet 
the thickest coal is the wall coal which is feet thick 
drilling depth to the wall coal is about feet and drilling to feet will test all coal sections 
coals present at kirby prospect are in the tongue river member of the tertiary fort union formation 
productive coals in the wyoming portion of the powder river basin in the cx field are also fort union formation coals 
potentially productive coals at kirby prospect include the canyon  wall  carlson  poker jim pawnee  brewster arnold  king sawyer  and flowers goodale coals 
the wall coal is the thickest coal in the prospect area with feet of development throughout the area 
the wall coal splits and thins south and east of the prospect area 
drilling depth to the wall coal is about feet over most of the prospect 
the wall coal outcrops along the kirby on the east margin of the prospect and along rosebud creek on the northwest portion of the prospect 
at present there has been no gas content analysis of the wall coal in the immediate vicinity 
however  at a recent spacing hearing before the montana oil and gas commission for wells located in ts re  pennaco energy presented an exhibit with estimated gas content for various coals 
pennaco s estimate for the wall coal is ft ton 
the coal intervals below the wall coal range in thickness from feet or less to around feet 
the king sawyer coal and flowers goodale are each feet thick throughout the prospect area 
both of these coal zones have produced some gas from shallow water wells located east of the prospect area 
total combined coal thickness over the area is around feet 
the kirby prospect is located in a developing portion of the powder river basin 
production and sales of coalbed methane have been established south of the prospect 
gas market and pipeline access are closely established in the area 
thick and multiple coals are present in the prospect area 
production from the area may be enhanced by the structural features present over the prospect 
successful completion of multiple coal zones in wells will greatly add to the potential reserves of the area

minerals uranium general 
use has interests in several uranium bearing properties in wyoming and utah and in uranium processing mills in sweetwater county  wyoming the sweetwater mill and in southeastern garfield county  utah the shootaring mill 
all the uranium bearing properties are in areas which produced significant amounts of uranium in the s and s 
use plans to develop and operate these properties directly or through a subsidiary company or a joint venture to produce uranium concentrates uo for sale to public utilities that operate nuclear powered electricity generating plants 
in addition  other uranium bearing properties in new mexico and wyoming are held by yellow stone fuels corp 
a minority joint subsidiary of use and crested 
however  until uranium oxide prices improve significantly  all of the uranium properties are in care and maintenance mode  meaning that work is performed to keep the assets in stand by mode and ready for later activity and permitting work is done as needed mostly monitoring and reporting to keep existing permits in effect 
green mountain unpatented lode mining claims the green mountain claims on green mountain in fremont county  wyoming  including claims on which the round park jackpot uranium deposit is located  and the sweetwater mill  approximately miles south of the proposed jackpot mine  are held by the green mountain mining venture gmmv  owned by kennecott uranium company kuc or kennecott  a subsidiary of kennecott energy and coal company of gillette  wy

yellow stone fuels corp 
ysfc  was organized on february  in ontario  canada 
as of february   ysfc acquired all the outstanding shares of common stock of yellow stone fuels  inc a wyoming corporation which was organized on june  in exchange for ysfc issuing the same number of shares of ysfc stock to the former shareholders of yellow stone fuels  inc yfi 
ysfc and its wholly owned subsidiary yellow stone fuels  inc are herein collectively referred to as ysfc 
in order to concentrate the efforts of use on conventional uranium mining using the shootaring canyon and sweetwater mills  use decided to take a minority position in ysfc and not be directly involved in properties believed suitable for the production of uranium through the in situ leach isl mining process 
use will have the right of first refusal with respect to any uranium ore bodies ysfc discovers which are amenable to conventional mining and milling and ysfc will have the right of first refusal with respect to ore bodies discovered by use amenable to the isl process 
in the isl process  groundwater fortified with oxidizing agents is pumped to the ore body  causing the uranium contained in the ore to dissolve 
the resulting solution is pumped to the surface where it is further processed to uranium oxide which is shipped to conversion facilities for eventual sale 
generally  the isl process is more cost effective and environmentally benign compared to conventional mining techniques 
in addition  less time may be required to bring an isl mine into operation than to permit and build a conventional mine and mill 
ysfc has ceased operations and abandoned all of its claims  due to the depressed market for uranium oxide 
ysfc s equipment which had been stored at the gmmv s sweetwater uranium mill  has been conveyed to kennecott as part of the settlement agreement with kennecott 
registered exchange offer 
in fiscal  ysfc sold  shares of common stock to investors in a private placement  at per share  net proceeds to ysfc were  after payment of  in commissions to the placement agent affc  denver  colorado and  in legal and accounting expenses 
most of these investors were accredited investors 
the securities were sold pursuant to rule of regulation d under the securities act of  and are restricted from resale under rule in connection with the private placement  in september  use entered into an exchange rights agreement with ysfc and affc 
pursuant to the exchange rights agreement between use  ysfc and affc  use made a registered exchange offer to each of the ysfc shareholders who invested in ysfc through affc in late and early the exchange offer also was made by use to each holder of the ysfc warrants  who exchanged some or all of the ysfc warrants for use warrants see below 
shareholders of ysfc who did not invest in ysfc through affc were not eligible to participate in the exchange offer 
the exchange rights agreement was intended to provide liquidity to the ysfc shareholders and the holders of the ysfc warrants  by allowing them the opportunity to exchange their securities in a private company ysfc for securities in a nasdaq nms public company use 
the exchange rights agreement was negotiated at arms length between ysfc  use which had founded and organized ysfc  and affc as ysfc s placement agent in the private offering of ysfc restricted shares 
under the exchange rights agreement  if ysfc were not listed on nasdaq nms by the eighteenth month anniversary of the exchange rights agreement  use would be required at that time to make an offer to the ysfc shareholders to exchange free trading shares of use common stock for their restricted shares of ysfc 
an initial listing on nasdaq nms would require ysfc to meet several conditions  including having minimum net tangible assets of  and at least shareholders 
ysfc did not meet these conditions to listing 
therefore  use filed a registration statement on form s declared effective in march 
the exchange ratio for shares was based upon x the original investment amount paid by the ysfc shareholder plus percent simple annual interest  divided by y the average of the closing nasdaq nms bid prices for a share of use common stock for the five trading days before use receives the notice of election to exchange from each ysfc shareholder 
the average price for use common stock is referred to as the use share value 
no fractional use shares will be issued  any fractional shares will be rounded up to the next full use share 
as of may   the exchange offer had been completed

the property interests of use in utah through plateau resources limited plateau are plateau resources limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of use 
see plateau shootaring canyon mill below 
the tony m mine and the frank m properties  underground uranium deposits in san juan county  utah are located partially on utah state mining leases 
plateau is the lessee of the tony m mine and portions of the frank m properties and has posted a bond securing plateau s obligations to reclaim these properties 
the tony m mine was originally developed by plateau at the time plateau was owned by consumers power company cpc  a michigan public utility 
significant areas of uranium mineralization have been accessed and delineated by the prior owner s underground workings 
when the tony m mine was in production while plateau was owned by cpc  it produced ore containing from three to eight pounds of uranium concentrates per ton 
some of this ore was processed at the shootaring mill 
in addition  low grade uranium ore was stockpiled at the tony m mine and at the shootaring mill 
plateau also acquired the velvet mine and the nearby woods complex in the lisbon valley area in southeastern utah 
the velvet mine was fully developed and permitted by its prior owner and is located approximately miles by road from the shootaring mill 
the woods complex was formerly an operating uranium mine with a remaining undeveloped resource 
access to this resource would be by extending a drift approximately  feet from the former wood mine 
the woods mine property is not permitted  but use does not expect difficulty in obtaining a new permit because the surface facilities would occupy the site that has been disturbed from previous operations 
the green mountain mining venture gmmv project gmmv 
in fiscal  use entered into an agreement to sell percent of its interests in the green mountain uranium claims  and certain other rights  to kennecott for  and a commitment by kennecott to fund the first  of gmmv expenditures pursuant to management committee budgets 
at the same time use and kennecott formed the gmmv and entered into a joint venture agreement the gmmv agreement with use to develop  mine and mill uranium ore from the green mountain claims  and market uranium oxide 
for detailed explanation of the gmmv agreement  please see us energy corp s 
form k at pages  and footnote f to the financial statements 
in fiscal  kennecott filed a lawsuit to dissolve the gmmv 
use counterclaimed for damages 
this lawsuit was settled on september  kennecott and use have agreed to ask the court to dismiss all parties claims in the lawsuit 
under the settlement agreement  kennecott has paid the company million and will pay  five days after court approval is received and another  in january  to acquire all of use s and crested and usecc s interest in the gmmv  its properties and the sweetwater uranium mill with certain exemptions 
kennecott also has assumed all reclamation and other liabilities associated with the gmmv  its properties  the sweetwater mill and all liabilities associated with the gmmv since its inception  including the historical liabilities associated with the sweetwater mill prior to its acquisition by the gmmv 
use and crested and usecc together have retained a net profits royalty in any future uranium oxide produced from the gmmv mining claims through the sweetwater mill currently in a standby mode and not operational 
the ion exchange facility on the sheep mountain properties will not be transferred to kennecott  nor will the cleanup liabilities associated therewith be assumed by kennecott 
however  use and kennecott have agreed to cooperate in the disposal of the facility into the sweetwater mill s disposal and impoundment areas 
also  certain items of mining equipment held by the gmmv have been conveyed to use  and will be removed from the gmmv properties in at such time as kennecott has completed necessary reclamation work on the green mountain unpatented lode mining claims including the round park uranium deposit proposed to be mined through the jackpot mine kennecott will quit claim all such mining claims to use and crested  as well as certain equipment currently being used at the mine including a compressor and standby generator 
kennecott will keep the sweetwater mill 
for information on the green mountain claims  see below 
properties the green mountain claims include the big eagle properties on green mountain  which contain substantial uranium mineralization  and are adjacent to other mining claims 
the big eagle properties contain two open pit mines  as well as related roads  utilities  buildings  structures  equipment and a stockpile of  tons of uranium material with a grade of approximately 
uo the assets include two buildings  square feet and  square feet formerly used by pathfinder mines corporation pmc in mining operations 
also included are three ore hauling vehicles  each having a ton capacity 
the round park jackpot mining claims contain deposits of uranium which have been estimated to contain  pounds of uo  the grade averages pounds of uo per ton of mineralized material 
the gmmv had planned to mine this mineralized material from two decline tunnels percent slope in the jackpot mine driven underground from the south side of green mountain 
the first of several mineralized horizons in the round park deposits  is about  feet vertically down from the surface of green mountain 
this work was halted in july sweetwater mill 
in fiscal  the gmmv acquired the sweetwater uranium processing mill and associated properties located in sweetwater county  wyoming  approximately miles south of the proposed jackpot mine  from a subsidiary of union oil company of california unocal  primarily in consideration of kennecott and the gmmv assuming environmental liabilities  and decommissioning and reclamation obligations 
the sweetwater mill was designed as a  ton per day tpd facility 
unocal s subsidiary  minerals exploration company  reportedly processed in excess of  tpd for sustained periods 
the mill is one of the newest uranium milling facilities in the united states  and has been maintained in good condition 
unocal has reported that the mill buildings and equipment have historical costs of  and  respectively 
as consideration for the sweetwater mill  gmmv agreed to indemnify unocal against certain reclamation and environmental liabilities  which indemnification obligations are guaranteed by kennecott corporation parent of kennecott uranium company 
the gmmv is responsible for compliance with mill decommissioning and land reclamation laws  for which the environmental and reclamation bonding requirements are approximately  which includes a  bond required by the nrc 
none of the gmmv future reclamation and closure costs are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the reclamation and environmental liabilities assumed by the gmmv and now kennecott s sole responsibility consist of two categories cleanup of the inactive open pit mine site near the mill the source of ore feedstock for the mill when operating under unocal  including water heavy metals and other contaminants and tailings heavy metals dust and other contaminants requiring abatement and erosion control associated with the pit  and decontamination and cleanup and disposal of the mill building  equipment and tailings cells after mill decommissioning 
the wyoming deq exercises delegated jurisdiction from the united states environmental protection agency epa to administer the clean water act and the clean air act  and directly administers wyoming statutes on mined land reclamation 
the sweetwater mill is also regulated by the nrc for tailings cells and mill decontamination and cleanup 
the epa has continuing jurisdiction under the resource conservation and recovery act  pertaining to any hazardous materials which may be on site when cleanup work is started 
plateau s shootaring canyon mill acquisition of plateau resources limited plateau 
in august  use purchased from consumers power company cpc  all of the outstanding stock of plateau which owns the shootaring canyon uranium processing mill and support facilities in southeastern utah the shootaring mill for a nominal cash consideration 
the shootaring mill holds a source materials license from the nrc 
in the purchase of the stock from cpc  use agreed to various obligations more fully set out in use s form k at pages and shootaring mill and facilities 
the shootaring mill is located in southeastern utah and occupies acres of a acre plant site 
the mill was designed to process tpd  but only operated on a trial basis for two months in mid summer of in  plateau placed the mill on standby because cpc had canceled the construction of an additional nuclear energy plant 
plateau also owns approximately  tons of uranium mineralized material stockpiled at the mill site and approximately  tons of mineralized material stockpiled at the tony m mine

sheep mountain partners smp smp partnership 
in february  use acquired uranium mines  mining equipment and mineralized properties sheep mountain mines at crooks gap in south central fremont county  wyoming  from western nuclear  inc these crooks gap mining properties are adjacent to the green mountain uranium properties 
smp mined and sold uranium ore from one of the underground sheep mines during fiscal and production ceased in fiscal  because uranium could be purchased from the spot market at prices below the mining and milling costs of smp 
in december  use sold percent of the interests in the crooks gap properties to nukem s subsidiary cric for cash 
the parties thereafter contributed the properties to and formed sheep mountain partners smp  in which use received an undivided percent interest 
smp is a colorado general partnership formed on december   between use and nukem  inc of stamford  ct nukem through its wholly owned subsidiary cycle resource investment corporation cric 
each group provided one half of  to purchase equipment from western nuclear  inc  use also contributed its interests in three uranium supply contracts to smp and agreed to be responsible for property reclamation obligations 
the smp partnership agreement provided that each partner generally had a percent interest in smp net profits  and an obligation to contribute percent of funds needed for partnership programs or discharge of liabilities 
capital needs were to have been met by loans  credit lines and contributions 
nukem is a uranium brokerage and trading concern 
smp was directed by a management committee  with three members appointed by use  and three members appointed by nukem cric 
the committee has not met since as a result of the smp arbitration litigation 
during fiscal  certain disputes arose between the partners of smp 
these disputes resulted in arbitration litigation and subsequent consensual arbitration from which an order and award was issued on april  such proceedings are still under appeal 
properties 
until june   smp owned unpatented lode mining claims on the crooks gap properties  including two open pit and five underground uranium mines and an inventory of uranium ore 
in connection with a partial settlement of litigation arbitration between use and nukem cric  smp conveyed these mineral properties and equipment to use 
production from the properties is subject to sliding scale royalties payable to western nuclear  inc  with rates ranging from one to four percent on recovered uranium concentrates 
as of the date of this report  smp and or use and usecc owned unpatented lode mining claims and a acre wyoming state mineral lease in the crooks gap area 
an ion exchange plant is located on the properties which can be used to remove natural soluble uranium from mine water 
use has submitted a plan to the nrc to decommission this facility and obtained a three year extension for timeliness of decommissioning 
this facility may be disposed of at the sweetwater mill impoundment facility see above 
property maintenance 
currently  use has a maintenance staff on site to care for and maintain the properties 
permits 
permits to operate existing mines on the crooks gap properties have been issued by the state of wyoming 
amendments are needed to open new mines within the permit area 
as a condition to issuance of the permits  a npdes water discharge permit under the clean water act has been obtained 
monitoring and treatment of water removed from the mines and discharged in nearby crooks creek is generally required 
during the past two years  smp did not discharge wastewater into crooks creek  and the mine water is presently being discharged into the smp mcintosh pit

gold sutter gold mine california sutter gold mining company 
in fiscal  use acquired an interest in the lincoln project including the underground lincoln mine and the  foot stringbean alley decline in the mother lode mining district of amador county  california 
the entire lincoln project is now owned by sutter gold mining company  a wyoming corporation sgmc  which is a owned and controlled subsidiary of use as of may  the lincoln project has been renamed the sutter gold mine sgm 
as discussed below  sgmc has a plan to put the sgm into production 
however  implementation of this plan will require substantial capital financing 
recent record low prices for gold have made financing difficult 
these low prices and the lack of capital have resulted in a substantial write down of the sgmc assets 
see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for fiscal due to the depressed gold price and lack of available funding  sgmc has deferred the start of construction of the  ton per day gold mill complex and development of the underground mine 
plans to develop the mine into a visitor s center to generate cash flow while the gold prices remain depressed are being evaluated 
like uranium  current gold prices are too low to allow smgc to raise the capital necessary to place the gold property into production 
except for limited infrastructure improvements in  the assets are in care and maintenance mode and the exploration permits are being kept current as necessary 
in fiscal  sgmc completed private financings totaling a net of us   through a private placement conducted in the united states by raf financial corp  now american fronteer financial corp 
or affc  and  through a private placement conducted in toronto  ontario  canada by cm oliver company limited 
the net proceeds of  from these financings after deduction of commissions and offering costs were applied to pre production mine development  mill design  permitting and property holding and acquisition cost 
additional financing of up to  will be sought to fund the development and construction of the mine mill 
during fiscal  sgmc amended its conditional use permit see permits and future plans  finalized the process flow of the mill  entered into the final design engineering contract with the engineering firm of lockwood greene of dallas  texas and built the entrance road to the mine 
once a decision to commence production is made  from that date  it is estimated it will take approximately months to complete the mill complex construction and pour the first bar of gold 
after completion of the two private financings  and taking into account a restructuring of the ownership of use in sgmc  use owns a  contingent stock purchase warrant the use warrant which was issued to use in connection with the restructuring of sgmc for the canadian private placement 
the use warrant provides that for each ounce of gold over  ounces added to the proven and probable category of sgmc s reserves up to a maximum of  additional ounces  using a cut off grade of ounces of gold per ton at a minimum vein thickness of feet  use will be entitled to cash or additional shares of common stock from sgmc without paying additional consideration at sgmc s election 
the number of additional shares issuable for each new ounce of gold reserves will be determined by dividing us by the greater of or the weighted average closing price of the common stock for the trading days before exercise of the use warrant 
the use warrant is exercisable semi annually 
sgmc may prevent the exercise of the use warrant by paying use us in cash for each new ounce of gold payable out of a maximum of of net cash flow from sgmc s mining operations 
additional ore reserves will be determined by an independent geologist agreed upon by the parties 
april transaction for cash and sgmc special warrants 
as of april   use entered into four separate stock purchase agreements with four canadian investment funds  for the issuance of  shares of common stock of use  in consideration of the funds payment to use of  in cash and the delivery to use of  special warrants of sgmc 
the funds had paid sgmc a total of cdn  in may  pursuant to a private offering in canada  to purchase the special warrants from sgmc 
in fiscal  use issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for  special warrants from sgmc shareholders increasing use s ownership of sgmc by

usecc management agreement with sgmc 
effective june   sgmc entered into a management agreement under which use provides administrative staff and services to sgmc 
use is reimbursed for actual costs incurred  plus an extra during the exploration and development phases  during the construction phase  and during the mining phase such charge to be replaced with a fixed sum which the parties will negotiate at the end of two years starting when the mining phase begins 
the management agreement replaces a prior agreement by which use provided administrative services to sgmc 
properties 
sgmc through its subsidiary usecc gold llc holds approximately acres of surface and mineral rights owned  acres of surface rights owned  acres of surface rights leased  acres of mineral rights leased  and acres of mineral rights owned  all on patented mining claims near sutter creek  amador county  california 
the acreage of mineral rights owned will be decreased to about acres in the properties are located in the western sierra nevada mountains at from  to  feet in elevation  year round climate is temperate 
access is by california state highway from sacramento to california state highway  then by paved county road approximately 
miles outside of sutter creek 
surface and mineral rights holding costs will aggregate approximately  from june  through may  property taxes for fiscal are estimated to be  the leases are for varying terms  and require rental fees  advance production royalties  real property taxes and insurance 
the lease that was to expire in february has been extended through its force majeure clause due to the low price of gold 
leases expiring before will generally be extended automatically  so long as minerals are continuously produced from the property that is subject to the lease or minimum payments are made 
other leases may be extended for various periods on terms similar to those contained in the original leases 
production royalties are from to most are 
the various leases have different methods of calculating royalty payments net smelter return and gross proceeds 
a separate holder of four of the properties that were assembled into the sgm holds a percent net profits interest on production from such properties  which was granted by a prior owner of the project 
an additional percent net smelter return royalty is held by a consultant to a lessee prior to that owner s acquisition of the properties  which percent interest covers the same four properties 
permits and future plans 
in august  the amador county board of supervisors issued a conditional use permit cup allowing mining of the sgm and milling of production  subject to conditions relating to land use  environmental and public safety issues  road construction and improvement  and site reclamation 
the permit will allow construction of the mine and mill facilities in stages as the project gets underway  thereby reducing initial capital outlays 
additional permits for road work  dust control and construction of mill and other surface improvements need to be applied for in due course 
in august and september  the amador county board of supervisors certified the final subsequent environmental impact report fseir and approved all of the amendments requested by sgmc 
amendments to the cup will remove two tailings dams  eliminate the need to use cyanide on site  and eliminate mine related traffic on two county roads 
the certification and decision has been challenged in a lawsuit filed by a local citizens group  see legal proceedings 
since sgmc already has a valid cup  sgmc believes it may be able to move forward on certain parts of the development of the mine mill visitor center 
in any event  sgmc does not expect the appeal process to materially impact the current development plan or schedule 
visitor s center 
in fiscal  sgmc spent approximately  for surface infrastructure related to improving access to the mine site  and to a lesser extent tourist related improvements 
these improvements will help sgmc develop the tourist potential of sutter gold mine  pending improvements in the price of gold 
demographics indicate that within a mile radius  there is a total market population of million people with million tourists visiting the area each year 
the sutter gold mine museum attraction is located along scenic highway known as the gold road between the historic gold mining towns of sutter creek and amador city  amador county  california 
the amador county chamber of commerce estimates that million people drive by sgm s entrance each year 
facilities include a visitor s center with a gift shop and museum  a self guided tour of modern mining activities  visitor gallery museum  hiking trails  picnic areas and a special gold panning area 
sgmc is evaluating how the tourism business performs during fiscal and the first quarter of these evaluations could result in the business being curtailed  shut down or sold 
molybdenum as a holder of royalty  reversionary and certain other interests in properties located at mt 
emmons near crested butte  colorado  use is entitled to receive annual advance royalties of  pounds of molybdenum  or cash equivalent 
amax inc which was acquired by cyprus minerals company and was renamed cyprus amax minerals company in november and was acquired later by phelps dodge delineated a deposit of molybdenum containing approximately  tons of mineralization averaging molybdenum disulfide on the properties of use 
advance royalties are paid in equal quarterly installments until i commencement of production  ii failure to obtain certain licenses  permits  etc  that are required for production  or iii amax s return of the properties to use 
see note f to the use consolidated financial statements 
the advance royalty payments reduce the operating royalties six percent of gross production proceeds which would otherwise be due from cyprus amax from production 
there is no obligation to repay the advance royalties if the property is not placed in production 
the agreement with amax also provides that use receive  at such time as the mt 
emmons properties are put into production and  in the event amax sells its interest in the properties  use receives percent of the first  received by amax 
use has asserted that the acquisition of amax by cyprus minerals company was a sale of amax s interest in the properties which would entitle use to such payment 
cyprus amax has rejected such assertion and use is considering remedies 
use recognized   and  of revenues in fiscal  and respectively  related to this royalty interest 
molybdenum market information molybdenum is a metallic element with applications in both metallurgy and chemistry 
principal consumers include the steel industry  which uses molybdenum alloying agents to enhance strength and other characteristics of its products  and the chemical  super alloy and electronics industries  which purchase molybdenum in upgraded product forms 
the molybdenum market is cyclical with prices influenced by production costs and the rate of production of foreign and domestic primary and by product producers  world wide economic conditions particularly in the steel industry  the us dollar exchange rate  and other factors such as the rate of consumption of molybdenum in end use products 
when molybdenum prices rose dramatically in the late s  for example  steel alloys were modified to reduce reliance on molybdenum 
amax and cyprus minerals company were the two major primary producers of molybdenum in the united states until november  when amax was acquired by cyprus and formed cyprus amax 
thereafter  phelps dodge acquired cyprus amax 
this further concentrates copper production capabilities and added molybdenum reserves to phelps dodge

environmental general 
use s operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and the comprehensive environmental response compensation liability act cercla 
with respect to mining operations conducted in wyoming  wyoming s mine permitting statutes  abandoned mine reclamation act and industrial development and siting laws and regulations also impact use 
similar laws and regulations in california affect sgmc  operations and in utah laws and regulations effect plateau s operations 
use s management believes use is currently in compliance in all material respects with existing environmental regulations 
to the extent that production by smp  gmmv  sgmc or rmg is delayed  interrupted or discontinued due to need to satisfy existing or new provisions which relate to environmental protection  future use earnings could be adversely affected 
crooks gap 
an inoperative ion exchange facility at crooks gap currently holds a nrc license for possession of uranium operations byproducts 
use has applied to the nrc for permission to decommission and decontaminate the plant  dispose low level waste into the sweetwater mill tailings cell  and keep intact such of the facility as does not require dismantling and which is approved for unrestricted operation 
other environmental costs 
actual costs for compliance with environmental laws may vary considerably from estimates  depending upon such factors as changes in environmental laws and regulation eg  the new clean air act  and conditions encountered in minerals exploration and mining 
use does not anticipate that expenditures to comply with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or which are otherwise designed to protect the environment  will have any substantial adverse impact on the competitive position of the company 
employees as of august   use had approximately full time employees 
crested uses approximately percent of the time of use employees  and reimburses use on a cost reimbursement basis 
mining claim holdings title to properties 
nearly all the uranium mining properties held by gmmv  use and plateau are on federal unpatented claims 
unpatented claims are located upon federal public land pursuant to procedure established by the general mining law 
requirements for the location of a valid mining claim on public land depend on the type of claim being staked  but generally include discovery of valuable minerals  erecting a discovery monument and posting thereon a location notice  marking the boundaries of the claim with monuments  and filing a certificate of location with the county in which the claim is located and with the blm 
if the statutes and regulations for the location of a mining claim are complied with  the locator obtains a valid possessory right to the contained minerals 
to preserve an otherwise valid claim  a claimant must also pay certain rental fees annually to the federal government currently per claim and make certain additional filings with the county and the blm 
failure to pay such fees or make the required filings may render the mining claim void or voidable 
because mining claims are self initiated and self maintained  they possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from public real estate records and it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of an unpatented mining claim is challenged by the government  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon 
thus  it is conceivable that during times of falling metal prices  claims which were valid when located could become invalid if challenged 
disputes can also arise with adjoining property owners for encroachment or under the doctrine of extralateral rights see legal proceedings bgbi litigation 
rmg s properties and mineral leases of blm  state and fee lands  which require annual cash payments totaling approximately  during fiscal  of which is the obligation of rmg to keep the leases in effect 
proposed federal legislation 
the us congress has  in legislative sessions in recent years  actively considered several proposals for major revision of the general mining law  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal public lands 
if any of the recent proposals become law  it could result in the imposition of a royalty upon production of minerals from federal lands and new requirements for mined land reclamation and other environmental control measures 
it remains unclear whether the current congress will pass such legislation and  if passed  the extent such new legislation will affect existing mining claims and operations 
the effect of any revision of the general mining law on use operations cannot be determined conclusively until such revision is enacted  however  such legislation could materially increase the carrying costs of mineral properties which are located on federal unpatented mining claims  and could increase both the capital and operating costs for such projects and impair use s ability to hold or develop such properties

the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
due to uncertainties in the minerals business  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in any such forward looking statements 
overview of business the company is in the business of acquiring  exploring  developing and or selling mineral properties  including coalbed methane gas  uranium and gold 
as part of its mineral business  company has been in the contract drilling and construction business for third party coalbed methane companies 
the company also owns commercial properties which are in the tourism and rental business 
the company entered into a contract with quantum energy  llc quantum through its newly formed subsidiary rocky mountain gas  inc rmg  to acquire a working interest and net revenue interest in approximately  acres of leases on properties having potential for coalbed methane exploration and development in the powder river basin of southeastern montana 
the company also holds additional properties in northeastern wyoming that are part of the powder river basin 
these leases are outside the boundaries of the agreement that controls the  acres in montana and consist of acres in which the company owns varying interests 
in addition to the coalbed methane properties held in the powder river basin  the company holds a working interest and a net revenue interest of to in approximately  net mineral acres in the ham s fork coal fields in southwestern wyoming 
it is anticipated that the business operations of the company will be largely directed toward the development of its coalbed methane properties during fiscal and well into the future 
as in all mineral development operations  there are risks involved in the development of coalbed methane gas fields 
some of the known risks in the coalbed methane development and production business are  government regulations  delays in permitting  environmental restrictions  market price for methane gas  availability and capacity of pipe lines 
the company cannot accurately predict what if any of these risks will have on its business in the future 
the company will continue to seek financing through either the sale of equity in rmg or the company s common stock or a joint venture with an industry partner to fund its obligations on the maintenance and development of these properties 
the company owns  and during fiscal purchased additional  drilling and construction equipment that was used during fiscal on a contract basis for non related companies in coalbed methane development 
this work consisted of site preparation  drilling  casing  completion  dam construction  compressor and gathering pipeline construction and site reclamation 
during august of  the company determined it would no longer perform such services on a contract basis for third parties and concentrate its efforts on developing properties in which it owns an interest 
part of the drilling and construction equipment will be sold and a portion will be retained for work that the company will do on the properties that the company owns an interest in 
the company has interests in uranium properties in central wyoming and southern utah 
both properties in central wyoming have been or are part of partnership arrangements 
in fiscal the company entered into an agreement to sell a interest in its sheep mountain properties to cycle resources  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nukem  inc 
nukem this partnership  sheep mountain partners smp  and the assets contained in it have been in litigation for the past nine years 
during fiscal  a partial settlement agreement was reached wherein the company received all the mineral properties and one uranium supply contract 
nukem has for a second time appealed the decision to the th circuit court of appeals 
the appeal is pending 
in fiscal the company entered into an agreement to sell a interest in its uranium properties to kennecott 
these properties were then placed into the green mountain mining venture gmmv 
the gmmv also acquired additional mining properties and a uranium mill 
during fiscal  kennecott filed a civil action against the company in wyoming state court 
the company responded by filing an answer denying the allegations of kennecott and counterclaimed certain damages against kennecott 
settlement discussions to resolve the issues surrounding the gmmv have been successful in resolving the disputes 
the company and kennecott have agreed that the company will sell all of its remaining interest in the gmmv to kennecott for cash compensation of million  payable at the signing of the letter of intent  
million  million five days after the court approves the terms of the agreement and dismisses the case and in january kennecott assumed all reclamation liabilities of the mine and mill properties 
the company has the responsibility of removing certain assets from the mine properties including a gmix plant which will likely be buried in the sweetwater mill tailings cell 
the clean up of the gmix plant is covered by a cash reclamation bond that management believes sufficient to cover cost of reclamation 
the company also received certain equipment and a net profits royalty on any uranium produced from the gmmv mine properties 
the company s uranium property in southern utah consists of uranium mining claims and a state of the art uranium mill 
due to current depressed uranium prices  the company has placed all of its uranium properties on care and maintenance status 
the company is currently evaluating the prospects of the uranium market and may determine to dispose of part or all of it s interests in uranium through the sale of such interests or the reclamation of the properties 
the reclamation liabilities of clean up of all the company s uranium properties are covered by cash bonds  bonds secured by certain real estate assets of the company 
the company is evaluating the long term uranium market and may conclude to reclaim these assets 
the company s gold properties in the mother lode mining district of california are on a care and maintenance basis 
due to the lack of available funding  which is as a result of the depressed gold price  plans to construct a  ton per day gold mill complex and further development of the underground mine have been deferred 
during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment on these properties which did not affect the ownership of the properties but reflected only an economic realization evaluation of the properties at the then market price of gold and the known proven reserves of the property 
the company has evaluated the possibility of using the property as a tourism asset until the price of gold recovers 
such evaluations may result in the tourism business being sold  leased or discontinued 
the company has commercial operations in wyoming and southern utah 
the wyoming commercial operations at ticaboo utah near lake powell  consist of various real estate rental properties and the operation of an airport fixed base operation 
the utah commercial operations include a motel  restaurant  lounge  convenience store  boat storage  rental space for mobile homes and recreational vehicles and the sale of home lots and finished homes 
liquidity and capital resources as of may   the company had a working capital deficit of  as compared to working capital of  included in the working capital deficit is a  deferred purchase option from gmmv 
this is as a result of a payment made to the company from kennecott 
this payment is non refundable and is carried as deferred revenue at may  pursuant to the settlement of the gmmv litigation this amount plus the cash purchase price will be offset against the company s investment in certain gmmv equipment and the balance will be recorded as revenues 
the primary reason for the decrease in working capital of  was primarily as a result of decreases in cash   and assets held for resale and other   increased accounts payable of  current portion of long term debt   and draw down of the line of credit of  these decreases in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  cash of  was consumed by operations 
the non cash items that went into operations that resulted in a net loss from operations for the year of  were depreciation of  provision for doubtful accounts of  issuance of stock to the company sponsored esop retirement plan for employees of  non cash compensation of  and a change in other current assets of  the provision for doubtful accounts is a reserve that was established on receivables from employee notes and accounts receivable and the valuation of collateral on a loan made to the esop 
in prior years the company made a loan to the esop in the amount of  the esop purchased common shares of the company with this loan which have been held as collateral for the loan 
due to the market price at the year end of fiscal for the common stock of the company  a reserve in the amount of  was taken on this receivable 
due to the issuance of stock to employees  directors and others of rmg stock at below market price  a non cash compensation charge was taken to earnings 
these shares are restricted and are forefeitable until retirement  total disability or death of the individuals who received them 
cash was also consumed in investing activities in the amount of  major components of investing activities were the purchase of coalbed methane properties in the amount of  the purchase of equipment of  and the decrease in restricted investments of  the coalbed methane gas properties were purchased by rmg in developing areas having potential of coalbed methane gas 
it is believed that these properties will be developed into significant coalbed methane producing properties 
additionally equipment was purchased to expand the company s fleet of construction  drilling and support equipment 
this equipment was used throughout fiscal in contract construction and drilling activities and a portion of it will be used in future coalbed methane development work for the company s properties 
restricted investments increased as these cash deposits earn interest until such time as they are used for reclamation associated with the company s uranium mill in southern utah 
financing activities provided  in cash during fiscal this cash came from the issuance of preferred stock of the company  net  proceeds from the sale of stock by rmg of  proceeds from long term debt through the financing of equipment purchases of  and the draw down of the company s line of credit with its bank of  the shares of preferred stock  were issued at  per share  are convertible at the holders option to either  shares of the common stock of rmg or into common stock of the company based on the market price at the time of conversion 
such conversion rights exist for a two year period  beginning april  the preferred shares bear interest at per annum which is payable quarterly 
during fiscal  rmg received a total of  for the sale of  shares of its common stock to third parties 
 of these shares of rmg stock are subject to the payment of per annum interest  payable annually on the anniversary of the initial investment 
this interest payment is payable in the common stock of the company at the market price of the common stock of the company on the date the interest is due 
this interest payment is due and payable until such time as an initial public offering for rmg becomes effective with the securities and exchange commission 
rmg also sold an additional  shares of common stock to the company and its affiliates for  long term debt financing and the draw down of the line of credit were used to purchase additional drilling and construction equipment and fund on going operations 
proceeds from long term debt financing were  while a total of  in cash was applied to long term debt 
at may  the company had total long term debt  including the current portion  of  and owed  on its line of credit with a banking institution 
the total limit on the line of credit is  all long term debt and the line of credit are secured by assets which have sufficient value  management believes  to retire the debt 
the company has generated significant net losses during fiscal and resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately  at may  the company also has a working capital deficit of approximately  at may  that includes a  deferred purchase option 
if the deferred purchase option is excluded  the company has positive working capital of  at year end  the company did not have the working capital necessary to continue the level of capital development completed during fiscal or to fund a similar level of operations over the next year 
in order to reduce its overhead costs  the company has reduced its staff 
the company also has certain assets that are unencumbered that could be sold to generate cash to ensure its survival during the next year 
however  there can be no assurances that company assets could be liquidated in excess of their carrying values 
capital resources the primary source of the company s capital resources are the cash on hand  collection of receivables from contract construction and drilling operations at may    projected equity financing from rmg  sale of mine  construction and drilling equipment  sale of partial ownership interest in mineral properties  proceeds under the line of credit  the gmmv settlement proceeds  and possible settlement discussions with phelps dodge regarding a dispute on a molybdenum property and final determination of the smp arbitration litigation 
the company also will continue to receive revenues from its commercial operations in southern utah along with the rental and fixed base airport operations in wyoming 
additionally  the company will continue to offer for sale various assets such as lots and homes at the company s southern utah commercial operations along with real estate holdings in wyoming  colorado and utah 
the company has a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is secured by various real estate holdings and equipment belonging to the company 
at may  the line of credit had been drawn down by  and by the date of this report  the line of credit is being used for short term working capital needs associated with operations 
the company believes that cash resources on hand at may   cash received from kennecott as part of the gmmv settlement and the collection of outstanding receivables will be sufficient to sustain operations during fiscal the cash resources plus cash from kennecott for the gmmv settlement will not be sufficient  however  to provide funding for the company s maintenance and development of its coalbed methane gas business 
the company and rmg are seeking additional equity or an industry partner financing arrangement to develop its coalbed methane leases 
capital requirements the primary requirements for the company s working capital during fiscal are expected to be general and administrative costs  the cost of maintaining the smp and southern utah uranium properties and the sgmc gold properties and the costs associated with the expansion and development of the coalbed methane gas properties 
coalbed methane gas to acquire a working interest in  acres of leaseholds  rmg paid  to quantum energy  quantum in january and an additional  in may rmg is committed to pay quantum an additional  on or before december  if rmg does not make this final payment it must assign of its undivided wi in the properties back to quantum 
quantum  at its sole option  may elect to have rmg drill and complete additional wells for the equivalent cost of  if quantum exercises this option  rmg would own a wi nri in the wells drilled with those funds  but only after quantum has received  in net revenues payback from those wells 
if these payments are not made  the working interest could be reduced 
under the terms of the quantum agreement  the company through rmg has a  work commitment to drill and complete coalbed methane wells 
if rmg does not complete the work commitment and quantum spends part or all of that amount of funds to drill and complete wells on the quantum acreage  then rmg will have the right to buy back its working interest by satisfying certain penalties 
rmg also has the obligation to fund of the delay rentals on the quantum properties which amounts to   for rmg s share during fiscal to fund all of the rmg commitments  financing will need to be obtained from equity funding or an industry partner through the sale of a portion or all of rmg s ownership in the quantum properties 
mineral holding costs smp uranium properties the care and maintenance costs associated with the sheep mountain uranium mineral properties are the responsibility of the company 
the holding costs during fiscal were approximately  per month 
the company has initiated alternative methods of managing the properties in an effort to reduce these holding costs during fiscal the company has the obligation to deliver uranium to a utility under one of the smp supply contracts 
the company believes that it can either continue to deliver these pounds at a small profit margin or sell the entire contract to a third party supplier 
gmmv uranium properties the company and kennecott filed various court actions against each other during fiscal on september   the company and kennecott entered into a settlement agreement which resolved these disputes 
the company sold its remaining interest in the gmmv properties to kennecott for a total of million 
the company received 
million upon signing the letter of agreement to settle all disputes  it will receive five days after the court approves the settlement agreement and dismisses all claims and in january the company also received certain mining equipment and a net profits royalty 
kennecott assumed all reclamation liabilities of the gmmv mine and mill properties 
the company is responsible to remove certain assets including the gmix plant from the properties 
plateau resources uranium properties plateau owns and operates the ticaboo townsite  motel  convenience store  boat storage  restaurant and lounge 
additionally  plateau owns and maintains the tony m uranium mine and shootaring canyon uranium mill 
the company is pursuing alternative uses for these properties including alternative feed or waste disposal of low level nuclear waste 
the company is seeking joint venture partners and equity financing to enter into the alternative feed and waste disposal business as the expansion into this business will require additional capital 
it is not known what the outcome of these discussions will be 
in the management of the commercial operations of the plateau properties  the company has determined it will shut many of the operations down during the winter months which should improve the annual profits of the commercial operations 
sutter gold mining company gold properties due to the depressed market price of gold  the development of the gold properties has been deferred into the future 
sgmc has explored the possibility of using the properties as a tourism business until such time as the price for gold recovers 
the results of limited operations in the tourism business are being evaluated 
the results of these evaluations may result in the tourism business being expanded or terminated 
the core assets of the sgmc properties will continue to be maintained at as low a cost as possible 
debt payments debt to non related parties at may  was  as compared to  at may  the increase in debt to non related parties consists primally of debt due on the financing of equipment and annual insurance premiums 
the balance of the debt to non related parties is for the purchase of land and buildings by sgmc and various pieces of heavy equipment and bears different interest rates with various maturity dates 
all payments on the debt are current 
if construction or drilling operations are permanently reduced or discontinued  the equipment will be sold and the debt retired 
at may   the company had borrowed  of its line of credit and as of the date of this report  this debt is secured by the pledge of equipment and real estate assets of the company 
this debt will be retired through profits from operations  the settlement with kennecott and possible settlement of the nukem dispute or the sale of an interest in assets 
federal income tax issues the tax years through may  are closed after audit by the irs 
the company has attended appeals hearings with the irs in denver colorado to discuss resolving issues raised for fiscal and the issues have been resolved with the irs 
a final settlement agreement has not yet been approved but it is not believed that the settlement will have a material affect on the company 
reclamation costs it is not anticipated that any of the company s working capital will be used in fiscal for the reclamation of any of its mineral property interests 
the reclamation costs are long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
as a result of the settlement agreement entered into on september   kennecott assumed all reclamation liabilities of the gmmv mine and mill properties with the exception of the gmix plant and the removal of certain equipment from the gmmv properties 
the reclamation of the gmix plant is bonded with a cash bond which management anticipates will fully satisfy the obligation of reclamation 
the reclamation liability on the plateau uranium properties is  which is reflected on the balance sheet as a reclamation liability 
this liability is fully covered by cash investments which are recorded as long term restricted assets 
the future reclamation costs on the sheep mountain properties are covered by a reclamation bond which is secured by a pledge of certain of the company s real estate assets 
the reclamation bond amount is reviewed annually by the state regulatory agencies 
the company s reclamation liability on the sheep mountain properties is currently  the reclamation of sgmc gold properties is approximately  this reclamation obligation is bonded with a cash bond 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations revenues during fiscal  the company recognized revenues in three segments  minerals in the form of advance royalties on its molybdenum property   contract drilling and construction work in the coalbed methane industry   commercial operations in southern utah and other rental properties in wyoming   the company also recognized other revenues from oil sales of  from its interest in the lustre field on the fort peck reservation  interest revenues of  on cash equivalents invested in interest bearing accounts and management fees of  for services provided to the gmmv 
total revenues during fiscal were  a decrease of  from revenues of  in fiscal this decrease was as a result of decreased revenues in mineral sales of  commercial operations of  revenues from the partial settlement of the smp arbitration litigation of  management fees and other revenues of  interest revenues of  and the gain on disposal of assets of  these decreases in revenues were offset by increased revenues from contract drilling construction operations of  and oil sales of the decrease in mineral sales is as a result of the company recognizing revenues of  from the sale of uranium under a smp contract during fiscal no revenues were recognized from sales of uranium during fiscal this decrease in uranium sales plus the a decrease in the market price for molybdenum  which reduced the advance royalty from cyprus amax during fiscal by  accounted for the reduction in mineral sales revenues 
commercial operations decreased by  as a result of reduced equipment rental revenues received by the company for the rental of equipment to the gmmv during fiscal as compared to fiscal commercial operations at the ticaboo operations in southern utah increased by  during fiscal the reduced activity at gmmv during fiscal also was the main contributor to the reduced management fee revenue when compared with fiscal revenues in contract drilling construction operations were generated as a result of the company entering into the drilling and earth construction contract work in the coalbed methane gas business during fiscal no revenues from contract drilling construction work were recorded in fiscal the profit margin in the contract drilling and construction business is a function of the number of available contractors and is often very small 
the company has suspended operations in this area 
it is not known if the company will resume this type of work on a contract basis 
the company will maintain a certain amount of equipment in order to perform this type of work in for future for its own account 
increased oil revenues were as a result of higher market prices for oil which allowed the company to produce from more of its wells in the lustre field during fiscal costs and expenses costs and expenses were reduced in fiscal by  to  from  during fiscal this reduction was primary as a decrease in the impairment of mineral properties of  no impairment of mineral properties was taken during fiscal during fiscal the company determined that an impairment should be taken on the sgmc assets of  and the yellow stone fuels corp 
ysfc assets of  the impairment of the sgmc and ysfc assets related to the recover ability of the company s investment in the mineral properties and equipment based on the then market prices for gold and uranium 
other decreases in costs and expenses were a  reduction in commercial operations as a result of cost cutting efforts and  in oil production costs due to less repair expenditures being made on the wells during fiscal increases in costs and expenses during fiscal over fiscal are  in mineral operations   in contract drilling construction operations  provision for doubtful accounts of  and interest expense of costs and expenses in mineral operations during fiscal increased as a result of increased activities for the company s own account where mineral operations in previous years were associated primary with joint ventures that either reimbursed a portion or all of the costs 
contract drilling and construction costs recorded during fiscal have no comparative costs and expenses during fiscal these costs include all labor  equipment operating and repair expenses and other costs associated with contract drilling and construction 
prior to fiscal there were no contract drilling and construction operations 
general and administrative costs and expenses increased by  during fiscal included in this increase is non cash compensation of  which was as a result of the issuance of common shares of rmg stock below market 
the increase in general and administrative costs and expenses was offset by reductions of general and administrative costs and expenses at sgmc and other company operations resulting in a net decrease in general and administrative costs and expenses of  the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of  during fiscal was primary as a result of the valuation to market of the collateral held for the loan to the company s esop retirement plan 
interest expense increased by  during fiscal as a result of additional equipment financing activity 
operations resulted in a loss of  or per share fully diluted as compared to a loss of  or per share fully diluted during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal although the company experienced positive cash flows during fiscal  operations resulted in a net loss after taxes of  or per share as compared to a loss of  or per share in fiscal decreased revenue and the impairment of mineral assets are the primary cause for the increase in the fiscal loss 
revenues mineral sales decreased by  during fiscal this decrease resulted from no revenues recognized during fiscal from a smp base escalated uranium delivery contract  which generated revenues of  during fiscal from the final delivery under the contract 
there were reduced revenues from the advance royalty from cyprus amax of  due to reduced market prices for molybdenum 
these decreases in mineral sales revenue were slightly offset by net profits received from one of the smp purchase contracts of  during fiscal while no such revenues were recorded in fiscal commercial operations revenues decreased by  this decrease occurred primarily as a result of reduced equipment rentals to the gmmv 
the gmmv properties were on a standby basis during most of fiscal due to reduced uranium prices 
this decrease of equipment rental of  was offset by increased fuel sales at the company s southern utah commercial operations of oil sales decreased by  as a result of temporarily closing down oil production due to continued depressed market prices for crude oil and a continuing decline in the production of the oil wells 
subsequent to may  the company began producing from two of the oil wells 
the company will continue to evaluate future production based on estimated production rates and market prices for crude oil 
management fees and other revenues decreased by  primarily due to reduced contract work performed at the gmmv properties and management services at the smp properties 
the company is paid a percentage of all costs at the gmmv properties for contract services provided 
during fiscal  operations were significantly reduced at the gmmv properties  which reduced the related management fees 
upon receiving the smp mining properties in a partial settlement of the smp arbitration issues  the company was no longer entitled to management fees on the smp properties 
costs and expenses mineral operations increased from  during fiscal to  during fiscal this increase of  primarily related to care and maintenance costs associated with the smp properties 
the company became responsible for of these costs at the beginning of fiscal due to a partial settlement of the smp arbitration litigation issues which conveyed ownership of the smp mining properties to the company 
general and administrative expenses increased from  during fiscal by  to  during fiscal this increase was a result of the consolidation of sgmc for the full year of fiscal of  the consolidation of ysfc for the fourth quarter of   and the amortization of warrants granted to consultants of  and deferred compensation of  the largest increases in costs and expenses were impairments in mineral assets and provision for doubtful accounts

effects of changes in prices mining operations and the acquisition  development and sale of mineral properties are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous

uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold affect the company to the greatest extent 
currently  both gold and uranium are at historical low prices 
the company is continually evaluating market trends and data
