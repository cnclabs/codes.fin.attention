item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview lone star is the leading united states manufacturer of welded oil country tubular goods  which are steel tubular products used in the completion and production of oil and natural gas wells 
lone star is also a major manufacturer of line pipe  which is used in the transportation of oil and gas 
in addition  lone star is a leading manufacturer of specialty tubing products used in automotive  construction  agricultural and industrial applications 
in january  lone star augmented its specialty tubing products by acquiring the assets of fintube limited partnership  the largest specialty tubing manufacturer of heat recovery finned tubes  which are primarily used in combined cycle power generation plants 
historically  over of lone star s revenues have been generated through the sale of oilfield products 
as a result  lone star s revenues are largely dependent upon the state of the oil and gas industry  which has historically been volatile 
downturns in the oil and gas markets cause demand for lone star s principal products to decrease 
as a result  lone star s historical operating results have fluctuated based on the demand for its products 
lone star had an operating loss in due to the low level of oil and gas drilling activity that resulted from low oil and gas prices in the first half of the year 
lone star also sustained an operating loss from continued operations in  principally as a result of a continued decline in oil and gas drilling activity which reduced demand and prices for lone star s oil and gas casing and tubing products 
lone star s future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  the level of oil and gas drilling activity and competition from imports  in the case of its steel subsidiary  and continuing domestic and foreign demand for power generation  in the case of its fintube subsidiary 
oilfield products 
steel s oilfield products consist of i casing  which acts as the structural walls of oil and natural gas wells  ii production tubing  which transmits hydrocarbons to the surface  and iii line pipe  which is used in gathering and transmitting hydrocarbons from the wellhead to larger transmission pipelines 
demand for oilfield products is affected by drilling activity  which is driven by customers expectations of future oil and gas prices and political factors such as energy and trade policies 
domestic drilling activity was down in from the prior year  according to industry reports 
however  drilling activity accelerated in the second half of and by year end rigs were active  compared to at the end of steel s open orders for octg at december   were up from the prior year end due to the increase in drilling activity and demand attributable to reduced industry wide octg inventories 
specialty tubing products 
as a result of the january fintube acquisition see subsequent events note m to the consolidated financial statements  lone star s specialty tubing product segment now includes finned tubular products manufactured by fintube  in addition to the drawn over mandrel  or dom  tubing manufactured by steel 
finned tubular products are used in heat recovery steam generation applications such as combined cycle power generation plants and  to a lesser extent  in industrial processing plants and petrochemical plants 
steel s specialty tubing consists of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products requiring critical tolerances  precise dimensional control  and special metallurgical properties 
these products are used in the further manufacture of automotive  construction  and other industrial equipment such as hydraulic cylinders  stabilizer tubes and intrusion tubes  and machine parts 
demand for dom specialty tubing products  within the traditional markets  was down slightly in demand from certain asian countries was lower due to asian economic issues 
demand for hydraulic cylinders used in agricultural and construction related equipment was down due to decreased domestic farming activity and reduced building activity in certain asian economies 
steel s open orders at year end for dom products and as welded specialty tubing were up from the prior year end  due to increased demand for as welded specialty tubing resulting from significantly increased demand in for axle and other applications 
other tubular products and flat rolled steel 
flat rolled steel is steel coils manufactured by steel primarily for use in the production of its tubular products  although steel also sells flat rolled steel to fabricators of large diameter transmission pipe  storage tanks  rail cars and a variety of other construction and industrial products 
steel s other tubular products are principally used for structural and piling applications in the construction industry 
steel s participation in the flat rolled steel commodity market is generally concentrated in the southwestern region of the united states and is affected by factors such as price  capacity utilization  and raw material costs 
flat rolled steel is sold in highly competitive markets  with price  quality  and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
due to an influx of inexpensive imported flat rolled steel during and early  markets for flat rolled steel experienced excess supply and lower pricing 
as a result  steel s shipment volumes were down in and however  during the first half of  antidumping duties and quotas were established for suppliers from certain foreign countries which reduced the amount of imported foreign coils  resulting in increased shipments of coils produced by steel during the second half of fintube conducts a steel coil slitting storage processing business  where it i acts as a toll slitting agent for major steel customers  and ii provides steel storage and custom slitting 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of steel s and fintube s products is capital intensive 
utilization rates were low during the first half of and expanded significantly during the second half of at steel s manufacturing facilities 
the level of production volume through steel s various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  coils  electricity  and natural gas 
fintube s production volumes also affect its cost of manufacturing 
unlike steel  most of fintube s products are manufactured in specific configurations as ordered 
accordingly  costs are to some extent factored into product prices on an order by order basis 
steel has entered into certain marketing alliances and manufacturing arrangements with unrelated companies involving the marketing of their products and processing of flat rolled steel provided by steel into tubular products which provide steel access to additional manufacturing capacity 
fintube has licensed its manufacturing technology to licensees in india  italy  japan and korea 
fintube acquisition and overview of pro forma information 
on january   lone star s newly formed fintube subsidiary purchased substantially all of the assets of fintube limited partnership and its subsidiaries for a purchase price of approximately million  which included the issuance of approximately  shares of lone star common stock valued at million see subsequent events note m to the consolidated financial statements 
fintube s business primarily involves the production of finned tubes  boiler tubes and other products which are used in a variety of heat recovery applications 
in addition to heat recovery product operations  the fintube business includes storage and processing of steel coils for other steel manufacturers 
the fintube business also includes to a proprietary manufacturing process for flattening steel rod into narrow bands of thin gauge steel 
the fintube acquisition is expected to significantly increase lone star s consolidated revenues and cash flows beginning in lone star s revenues in  on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the fintube acquisition  increases by million to million 
additionally  the net loss of million  or per diluted share  incurred by lone star during becomes a net income of million  or per diluted share  on a pro forma basis 
the pro forma column in the following table sets forth consolidated financial information for lone star on a pro forma basis for the fintube acquisition  which gives effect to i the acquisition of the assets of fintube limited partnership as though the acquisition occurred on january   ii the issuance of  shares of lone star common stock as partial consideration for the fintube acquisition as though the stock was issued on that date  and iii the borrowing of million by lone star s fintube subsidiary under its new credit facility as though the borrowing occurred on that date

consolidated revenues reported in the statements of earnings are as follows in millions oilfield products revenues specialty tubing products revenues flat rolled steel and other tubular revenues consolidated net revenues shipments of products by segment are as follows in tons oilfield products    specialty tubing products    flat rolled steel and other tubular    total tons shipped    compared with net revenues of million in were lower than net revenues from oilfield products declined to million in shipment volumes and prices were down from levels and  respectively 
demand for steel s octg decreased as drilling activities declined to an historical low of active rigs in april  and the average rig count was down to in compared to the preceding year 
demand was also detrimentally impacted as new mill production was replaced by the consumption of excess industry wide octg inventories during the first half of specialty tubing products revenues decreased in by to million on higher shipment volumes to  tons offset by lower prices 
selling prices were less due to a higher percentage of aswelded tubular sales  reduced international sales  and slightly reduced prices for dom specialty tubing due to increased capacity in the industry 
shipment volumes were up due to increased sales of new heavy wall products used in axle and other applications 
flat rolled steel and other tubular products revenues were down to million 
selling prices were lower due to the impact on the first half of from illegal dumping of foreign coils during that resulted in an excess supply of flat rolled steel in domestic markets 
shipments in were flat compared to gross profits increased from million in to million in due to a reduction in costs of goods sold per ton related to lower slab costs  reduced overall spending and increased productivity 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased in to million due to significant spending and salaried workforce reductions made during the second half of interest income decreased from million in to million in due to lower average interest rates on invested cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
interest expense increased from million in to million in steel s revolving credit facility during had higher average interest rates which were offset by lower average borrowings than in loss from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  a improvement compared to million  or per diluted share in  excluding special charges in of million  or per diluted share 
a reduced loss in was due to lower slab costs  reduced spending  increased productivity and salaried workforce reductions offset partially by lower shipment volumes and pricing 
net operating loss carry forwards at december  totaled million see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
net loss of million  or per diluted share  improved relative to due to lower costs of goods sold in also  the net loss for included a million special charge 
compared with net revenues of million in were lower than net revenues from oilfield products declined to million in shipment volumes and prices in were down from levels by and  respectively 
demand for steel s octg decreased as drilling activities declined precipitously in the second half of the average rig count was down to in with only rigs operating at year end  compared to  at the end of demand was also detrimentally impacted as new mill production was replaced by the consumption of excess industry wide octg inventories 
also  demand declined due to increased competition from imported octg which grew to of the apparent supply available to the domestic market from in specialty tubing products revenues decreased by in to million because of lower shipment volumes despite slightly higher prices 
shipment volumes were down due to reduced sales for hydraulic cylinder applications in agricultural and construction related equipment and reduced international sales to certain asian countries 
flat rolled steel and other tubular products revenues were down in to million 
shipments were lower due to a dramatic increase in inexpensive imported foreign coils during that resulted in an excess supply of flat rolled steel in domestic markets 
gross profits decreased from million in to million in due to reduced shipment volumes in all products coupled with lower prices for oilfield products and slightly higher prices for specialty tubing products 
also  significantly decreased production volumes negatively impacted gross margins as fixed and semi fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units of production 
special charges 
in response to market conditions  steel restructured and downsized its operations 
lower operating rates resulted in the need to reduce employment levels and initiate other actions 
as a result  special charges of million were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  which included the following items in millions write down of property  plant  and equipment and related supplies to fair value renegotiated or canceled contractual obligations employee severance cost total special charges certain facilities permanently reduced or eliminated their operations  relying instead on alternative production or procurement methods 
this included a reduction in the production level of the electric arc furnace steelmaking facilities  with heavier reliance placed on purchased steel in coil and slab form 
additionally  some finishing processes and infrastructure utility services were permanently abandoned and completely replaced through outside procurement 
these actions triggered an assessment of the recoverability of the asset carrying costs and the resulting recognition of an impairment loss 
the determination of the impairment loss was based on an evaluation of future cash flows from operation of the steelmaking facilities and estimated salvage values of the steelmaking facilities and those facilities to be abandoned 
the net book value of these assets  which included property  plant and equipment supplies inventory  totaled million  of which million was written down 
certain supplier contracts were renegotiated or canceled to accommodate the lower operating levels resulting in a loss accrual of million at december  steel terminated employees or identified certain positions for elimination as of december  payments made to terminated employees were based on steel s standard severance package 
approximately employees covered by the severance package were ultimately terminated 
total employee severance costs included in special charges totaled million  of which million was paid in and million in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in to million due primarily to continued higher spending related to year readiness initiatives partially offset by lower selling expenses 
interest income decreased from million in to million in due to lower average interest rates on invested cash  short term investments and marketable securities 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to the conversion of lone star s million principal amount convertible subordinated debentures into common stock in august also  steel s revolving credit facility during had lower average interest rates which were offset by higher average borrowings than in other expense 
during  other expense of million was primarily related to the write off of prepaid bank fees on the restructuring of steel s revolving credit facility partially offset by gains from nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
in other income of million consisted of nonrecurring miscellaneous items 
loss from continuing operations in of million  or per diluted share  included million  or per diluted share  in special charges 
excluding special charges  the loss from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share 
the loss was due to lower shipment volumes for all products  particularly oilfield products  coupled with lower prices for oilfield products partially offset by slightly higher prices for specialty tubing products 
also  significantly decreased production volumes negatively impacted operating margins as fixed and semi fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units of production 
extraordinary item of million  or 
per diluted share  was realized in on the gain from cancellation of future obligations under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of act 
during extraordinary items totaling a net gain of million  or 
per diluted share  consisted of a gain of million for the downward adjustment of obligations under the act  partially offset by an extraordinary prepayment charge of million on the refinancing of steel s credit facility 
net loss of million  or per diluted share  in included special charges of million  or per diluted share  which were reflected in the loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  and partially offset by an extraordinary gain of million  or 
per diluted share 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   lone star had million in cash and short term investments and million in working capital 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in increased to million from million in due to the reduced net loss 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operations was used to fund capital expenditures and reduce revolving credit facilities 
in  net cash provided by operations was primarily used to upgrade property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by operations in was used in part to purchase the minority interest in steel and for purchase of treasury stock 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  which was primarily used for capital expenditures 
cash provided used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to increased working capital needs due to increased operations in the second half of the year 
cash provided by financing activities in was from issuance of stock and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
cash used by financing activities in was used primarily to purchase the minority interest in steel and purchase treasury stock 
cash provided by operations in increased to million from million in due to the reduced net loss 
on march   steel refinanced the million revolving credit facility that it had in place at year end with a million revolving line of credit and a three year million term loan 
under the new revolving credit facility  steel can borrow an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
at december   borrowings totaled million including million on the term loan with a remaining availability of million 
at steel s option  the interest rate is the prime lending rate plus or the libor plus 
steel pays a per annum fee on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of million  together with interest at the prime lending rate plus or the libor plus 
steel s assets other than real estate secure these loans 
in connection with lone star s purchase through its fintube subsidiary of assets from fintube limited partnership on january   steel borrowed million under its present credit facility to repay million of its subordinated loan to lone star  lone star guaranteed million of steel s credit facility and lone star used the loan repayment to fund a portion of the purchase price payable in the fintube acquisition 
at january   borrowings by steel totaled million  including the term loan  with a remaining availability of million 
on january   lone star s fintube subsidiary entered into a new senior credit facility providing a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan used to pay part of the cash portion of the purchase price in its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fintube limited partnership 
under the revolving line of credit  fintube can borrow an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
as of january   borrowings by the fintube subsidiary totaled approximately million  including the term loan  with a remaining availability  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory on such date  of approximately million 
steel s loan agreements at december  contain various restrictive covenants which require steel to meet specified quarterly financial ratios  including cash flow and net worth measurements  all of which steel met at december  and which steel expects to meet during fiscal year steel s ability to incur additional indebtedness and to pay cash dividends to lone star is also restricted under the agreements 
during  steel entered into slab consignment and sales agreements with third parties 
these inventory financing transactions have been accounted for as product financing arrangements 
inventory purchases financed under these arrangements have been recorded as inventory by steel 
at december   there was million included in accounts payable under these financing arrangements 
lone star s two subsidiaries  steel and fintube  operate in capital intensive businesses 
steel has made  and lone star expects fintube will be required to make  significant capital expenditures each year both for recurring maintenance necessary to keep manufacturing facilities operational and to comply with environmental and other legal requirements 
additionally  lone star periodically makes capital expenditures for technological improvements and for research and development projects 
lone star s borrowing capacity and the borrowing capacity of its subsidiaries are interrelated and substantially used 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  lone star may be unable to develop or enhance its products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
lone star s capital budget for is approximately million 
steel requires capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash generated by operations  borrowings under steel s and fintube s credit facilities and from lone star 
steel believes that cash generated by operations and its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will provide the liquidity necessary to fund its cash requirements during steel s operations are subject to restrictive environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various governmental agencies that include the tnrcc and the epa 
steel believes that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within its contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million annually in the foreseeable future 
fintube believes that its resources  including cash generated by operations and borrowings under fintube s credit facility and from lone star  will provide the liquidity and resources necessary to meet fintube s cash needs for working capital and other capital expenditures during lone star had no direct business operations other than steel in see subsequent events note m to the consolidated financial statements regarding fintube or significant sources of cash other than from short term investments or the sale of securities 
lone star is reimbursed by steel for most of its operating costs as provided by its cost sharing agreement with steel 
under steel s new revolving credit agreement  lone star s operating costs and steel s portion of lone star s consolidated taxes are the only funds that can be distributed by steel to lone star 
beginning in fintube will pay lone star an overhead fee of million per year  which is the maximum amount permitted by fintube s loan agreements 
lone star believes that reimbursements by steel and fintube for most of their operating costs and funds generated by cash and investments will be adequate to fund its cash requirements during forward looking information the statements included in this annual report regarding future financial performance and results and the other statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements
