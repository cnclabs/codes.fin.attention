item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
results of operations revenues total revenues for the weeks ended january  were billion  a decrease of  as compared to billion for the weeks ended january  the revenue decline is principally related to the wholesale segment which has experienced competitive pressures and the consolidation of a number of distribution facilities during the year 
partially offsetting the decline are improvements at retail due primarily to the acquisition of erickson s diversified corporation erickson s in june and gains in same store sales 
wholesale revenues for the year were billion compared to billion in  a decrease of 
revenues were negatively impacted by the shift of approximately million in sales from wholesale to the retail segment following the acquisition of erickson s 
in addition  the closure of five distribution centers since last year resulted in the unavoidable loss of independent accounts that could no longer be serviced economically by the company 
during the third quarter  the company reached an agreement to purchase certain assets of midwest wholesale food  inc  a wholesale supplier to grocery stores in the detroit  michigan metro area 
as a result  the company began servicing  from its bridgeport  michigan distribution center  independent retailers who were previously supplied by midwest 
this additional volume has improved productivity and eased the competitive pressures experienced by the company in its michigan market area 
comparing  a week year  wholesale revenues decreased 
from an adjusted week basis for the decline was largely attributed to the soft michigan market that existed at the time 
retail segment revenues were million for the year  compared to million for same period last year  an increase of 
the increase is largely due to the acquisition of erickson s stores in wisconsin and minnesota  two stores in cheyenne  wyoming  two stores in myrtle beach  south carolina and the opening of a new store in fargo  north dakota 
in spite of intense competition in the company s iowa market  which partially offset sales gains in other market regions  same store sales for the year increased 
over this marked the second consecutive year of increases 
comparing to  retail revenues declined in from adjusted  due to a net reduction in the number of corporate owned stores operated in revenues of the military division  the third reported segment of the company  increased compared to revenue improvements resulted from the distribution of new product lines  stronger overseas business and a general upturn in volume of product sold through the domestic military base commissaries 
in  military revenues declined 
from adjusted levels 
minimal growth in the size and number of military commissaries serviced by the company was the contributing factor to the relatively flat rate of increase 
gross margins gross margins were in  compared to in and in the increase in over the prior years reflects the growth in the proportion of retail revenues  which achieve higher margins 
retail revenues  as a percent of total reported revenues  were in  compared to and in and  respectively 
in addition  a number of operational factors have contributed to improvements in margins better overall margins for the retail segment as a result of a greater proportion of revenues derived from higher margin specialty departments  operational efficiencies in warehousing and transportation  due in part from warehouse consolidations  which lower the cost of goods  as well as a lifo credit resulting from deflation in food prices and planned reductions in inventories since last year 
in  the company recorded a lifo credit of 
million compared to charges of million and million in and  respectively 
sustained price increases throughout the year for tobacco and tobacco related products were the primary factors causing the significantly higher lifo charge in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues were in compared to in and in the increases in over and  are again due to the increasing proportion of corporate owned retail business  which typically operates at higher expense levels than wholesale 
also contributing to the increase are million of costs related to the company s successful year remediation efforts and million in costs associated with the closing of distribution centers that were not accruable in either the or special charges 
these included expenses related to the movement of inventories  utilities and real estate taxes in closed owned locations and employee relocation costs 
in addition  during the third quarter  the company incurred million in employee severance costs related to administrative staff reductions affecting employees throughout the company 
some benefit of these reductions was realized in the fourth quarter  with the full impact expected in bad debt expense for was million compared to million and million in and  respectively
