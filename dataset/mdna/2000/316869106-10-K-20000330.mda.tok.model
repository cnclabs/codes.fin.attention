revenue dollars in millions percent percent december  change change software revenue domestic international total software revenue percentage of total revenue customer support revenue domestic international total customer support revenue percentage of total revenue professional services and education revenue domestic international total professional services and education revenue percentage of total revenue hardware revenue domestic international total hardware revenue percentage of total revenue other revenue domestic international total other revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue domestic international total revenue the software revenue growth rate increased and in and  respectively 
the lower growth rate in as compared to was a result of reduced demand for our products due to customer and prospect focus on year issues 
our international markets were more impacted by these factors than the us particularly in the second half of the year 
customer support revenue consists of revenue from software maintenance contracts and fee for service revenues 
customer support revenue increased and in and  respectively  due to the growth of our customer base through new customer sales and sales of new products to the installed base 
professional services and education revenue is generated primarily from consulting and implementation services provided to end users of our software products  technical consulting services provided to our resellers and training services 
professional services are primarily performed on a time and material basis 
professional services and education revenue increased and in and  respectively 
this increase was attributable to our efforts to build our professional services capabilities to support our solutions oriented strategy as well as increased demand for our expanded professional services and education offerings 
hardware revenue is generated primarily from the sale of inch osars 
hardware revenue decreased and in and  respectively  due to expected decreases in new orders attributable to our continued focus on software related revenues 
we expect hardware revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenue 
other revenue is generated from the sale of spare parts  supplies and third party products 
other revenue decreased and in and  respectively  due to decreased sales of spare parts and third party products 
international revenue represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the lower percentage in was due to a weakness in order levels in the european market caused by customers and prospective customers concerns over the year and  to a lesser extent  the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
we expect international revenue to continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue 
however  international revenues are subject to certain risks including but not limited to political and economic instability  and currency fluctuations 
cost of revenue dollars in millions percent percent december  change change cost of software revenue percentage of software revenue cost of customer support revenue percentage of customer support revenue cost of professional services and education revenue percentage of professional services and education revenue cost of hardware revenue percentage of hardware revenue cost of other revenue percentage of other revenue cost of total revenue the cost of software revenue includes royalties paid to third parties and the cost of software distribution 
the cost of software revenue as a percentage of software revenue was in compared to in and the decrease in is attributable to distribution costs increasing at a lower rate than revenue 
the cost of customer support revenue includes customer support personnel  supplies  and the cost of third party hardware maintenance 
the cost of customer support revenue as a percentage of customer support revenue decreased to in from in and in the decrease in is attributable to increased revenue with no proportional increase in costs 
the decrease in was due to the higher proportion of fees for service revenue  as opposed to contract maintenance revenue  and the transition of high cost hardware maintenance services to a third party contractor 
the decrease in is primarily due to the transition of hardware maintenance to a third party contractor  offset by lower margins associated with international maintenance 
the cost of professional services and education revenue consists primarily of professional services personnel  training personnel and third party contractors 
the cost of professional services and education revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in this was primarily due to higher utilization rates as a result of increased revenue 
however  we expect that competition for qualified technical and managerial personnel for our professional services segment is intense and will remain so for the foreseeable future 
this may result in higher levels of compensation expense and higher cost of professional services revenue 
the cost of hardware revenue includes the cost of assembling osars and the cost of hardware integration personnel 
the cost of hardware revenue as a percentage of hardware revenue decreased to in from in and in the decreases are attributable to a reduction in fixed assembly costs corresponding to decreases in hardware revenue 
the cost of other revenue includes the cost of supplies  spare parts and third party product 
the cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to in from in and in the increase is due to declining revenue with a fixed expense base and sales of higher cost product 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expense dollars in millions percent percent december  change change research and development percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in salaries 
the increase in was attributable to market driven increases in salaries and recruiting costs necessitated by the intense competitive environment for software engineers and an increase in the cost of contract developers 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in  and we expect that competition for qualified technical personnel will remain intense for the foreseeable future and may result in higher levels of compensation expense for us 
we believe that research and development expenditures  including compensation of technical personnel  are essential to maintaining our competitive position and expect these costs to continue to constitute a significant percentage of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in and increased in the decrease in was due primarily to overall reduced spending including reduced legal fees and reduced sales training expenses 
the increase in was due primarily to the expansion of our sales force  an increase in sales training costs  and an increase in commissions associated with higher revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in and in the decrease from to was primarily due to containment of expenses combined with an increase in revenues 
restructuring and other costs 
the million in restructuring and other costs in represents the costs of a reduction in headcount associated with the restructuring of our sales and marketing operations  as well as costs of consolidating facilities 
the restructuring and other costs include approximately million for severance payments for employees  million for facility closing costs and million of other charges 
the million in restructuring and other costs in represented the costs of consolidating the watermark business unit s burlington  massachusetts engineering and marketing functions with those at our costa mesa  california location  as well as a reduction in headcount in certain other areas of the company 
the restructuring and other costs include approximately million for severance payments for employees  million for the write off of assets impaired by the decision to restructure  million for facility closing costs  million for equipment lease cancellations  million for cancellation of third party development contracts  million related to the withdrawal of certain products from the market and million of other charges 
at december   the remaining accrued restructuring and other costs of million are included in other accrued liabilities 
we anticipate that the remaining restructuring costs will be expended during 
other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and other items including foreign exchange gains and losses  the gain on sale of fixed assets  other items of income and interest expense 
other income  net of other expenses  was million in  million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was attributable to increased foreign exchange losses and increased interest expense associated with our foreign currency hedge activities partially offset by increases in interest income 
the increase in over was primarily due to a decrease in our foreign exchange losses 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was a charge of million in  compared to a charge of million and a benefit of million recorded in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction in was due to our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholder s equity 
foreign currency risk 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from and the net assets of selected subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if an underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
our forward contracts generally have an original maturity of three months 
the total notional values of forward contracts purchased and forward contracts sold were million and million  respectively 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on financial results see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that inflation has not had a significant impact on the price of our products  the cost of our materials  or our operating results for the three years ended december  financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   combined cash  cash equivalents  and investments short and long term were million  an increase of million from the million at the end of cash provided by operating activities in was million and resulted primarily from net income  an increase in unearned maintenance revenue related to prepaid maintenance contracts  additions to net income for depreciation and amortization expense offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash used by investing activities totaled million  consisting of capital expenditures  proceeds from sales and the net sale and maturity of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities was million consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and the employee and non employee director stock purchase plan 
cash provided by operating activities in was million and was comprised primarily of additions to net income for depreciation and amortization expense and increases in accounts payable  accrued compensation  and unearned maintenance revenue 
cash used by investing activities totaled million  consisting of capital expenditures offset by the net sale and maturity of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities was million consisting of proceeds from issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and the employee and non employee director stock purchase plan  offset by the cost to repurchase common stock 
cash provided by operating activities in was million 
cash used by the net loss for the year was offset by lower accounts receivable balances associated with a lower average days sales outstanding  lower inventories associated with our decrease in hardware revenue and additions to net income for depreciation and amortization 
cash used by investing activities totaled million  consisting of capital expenditures offset by the net sale and maturity of marketable securities 
cash used by financing activities was million and was the result of the repurchase of common stock offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee and non employee director stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in we anticipate that we will acquire approximately million of capital equipment in our primary capital expenditures are for research and development equipment  demonstration and training equipment  enhancements to our internal network and business systems  leasehold improvements on leased property  and furniture 
the increase in capital expenditures over the levels of the prior two years was due primarily to large internal information technology infrastructure and systems projects  as well as expenditures incurred to improve and furnish our new office in kirkland  washington 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased million of our common stock 
we repurchased million of our common stock in for a total of million in treasury stock 
we anticipate that our present cash balances  together with internally generated funds and credit lines  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs throughout other matters year in  we implemented a year integrity program the program to ensure that our computer software products and internal business systems would function properly in the year and thereafter 
since january   we have not experienced any problems with our software products or internal business systems to properly manage and manipulate data related to the year all new generations of our software products were released as year compliant 
however  not all our software products were year compliant and we did not make them so 
accordingly  upgraded year compliant versions of such software products were made available to customers and resellers who would then bear the responsibility for installing the upgraded software product in order to make their systems year compliant 
some of our customers were running software product versions that were not year compliant 
we have been encouraging such customers to migrate to current software product versions 
all customers were kept informed of the release of year compliant updates and upgrades via our readiness disclosure statement on our web site 
the inability of any of our software products to properly manage and manipulate data in the year and beyond could result in increased costs  customer satisfaction issues  potential lawsuits and other costs and liabilities  as well as customers being unable to run software licensed from us and incurring significant costs from the resultant business interruption 
we spent an estimated million on year software product related projects through december  we formed a rapid response team as part of customer support that responded to problems during the year date change period 
we spent an estimated million during the year date change timeframe 
we communicated with significant third party vendors of computer software with which our systems interface or upon which our software products depend 
such third party vendors delivered year versions or guaranteed that their current computer software was year compliant 
in the event that our customers have year related problems with such third party software  we have been assured that the third party will remediate their own year issues 
the program also included a review of all internal it systems for year compliance 
our significant business systems financial  operational  marketing  customer support  etc 
were reviewed and were either already year compliant or were upgraded and or replaced so as to be year tested and compliant by october  all of the hardware and software deployed in our technical infrastructure was either fully year tested and compliant or had been replaced with year compliant components by october  we also evaluated it related environmental systems heating  air conditioning  security  etc 
and made all such systems year compliant by october  business teams monitored the critical systems  and service centers to react immediately to facilitate repairs at the end of the year data retention and recovery procedures were in place for critical business data to provide back ups with on site and off site data copies 
our cost to fund solely year compliant projects was million through december  the euro conversion 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
these countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency from that date 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
these countries will issue sovereign debt exclusively in euro and will re denominate outstanding sovereign debt 
effective on this date  these countries no longer control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for the legacy currencies 
instead  the authority to direct monetary policy  including money supply and official interest rates for the euro  is exercised by the new european central bank 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in these countries as a denomination of the euro between january  and january  the transition period 
during the transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
however  conversion rates no longer will be computed directly from one legacy currency to another 
instead  a triangulation process will be applied whereby an amount denominated in one legacy currency first will be converted into an amount denominated in euro  and the resultant euro denominated amount is converted into the second legacy currency 
we have made the necessary changes to our internal business systems to support transactions denominated in the euro  including establishing euro price lists for effected countries 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact the conversion to the euro will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on this evaluation to date  we currently do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of the euro conversion  except that we cannot currently assess the impact that a common euro based price list will have on how we market our products in europe nor the impact  if any  on revenues generated in europe 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and will require us to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are hedges  changes in the fair value of derivatives will be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments 
we believe the impact of adopting this standard will not be material to our results of operations or equity 
environmental matters we are not aware of any issues related to environmental matters that have  or are expected to have  a material affect on our business
