item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing on pages to results of operations xicor s sales were million in compared to million in and million in fiscal sales increased compared to primarily due to increased sales of product into wireless communications applications and increased sales of digitally controlled potentiometer products 
fiscal year presented xicor with a major challenge as sales declined sharply from  primarily due to the global slowdown in demand that resulted from the asian economic crisis 
the substantial excess global capacity in the industry caused a severe erosion of memory chip prices  which also contributed to the decline in xicor s sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  in  and in the gross profit percentage improved in compared to due to product mix  higher average selling prices and a reduction in the overall average cost of products shipped due to increased outsourcing and cost reductions at xicor s in house manufacturing operations 
the decline in the gross profit percentage compared to was primarily due to lower average selling prices as a result of competitive price pressures  xicor s increased manufacturing cost level associated with increased production capacity and upgrading of the wafer fabrication operations during and and decreased factory utilization 
during xicor substantially reduced the production volume in its factory in response to ongoing weak business conditions 
unfavorable overhead variances that resulted from the fixed nature of certain manufacturing costs and the smaller number of units in production were expensed 
additionally  in the second quarter of  xicor wrote down inventories by million to cover declining sales prices and inventories of certain devices that were discontinued as xicor streamlined its product portfolio 
in  as a result of the economic crisis in asia and declining global sales prices due to intense competition  xicor established reserves of million for inventories built for certain asian customers and to write down inventory values due to lower expected selling prices 
excluding the inventory write down  gross profit as a percentage of sales was 
research and development expenses were of sales in  in  and in research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales in compared to primarily due to lower personnel costs and higher sales and  to a lesser extent  lower depreciation 
research and development expenses were relatively consistent as a percentage of sales in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented of sales in  in  and in selling  general and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of sales in compared to primarily due to higher sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to due to intensified sales and marketing activities 
during xicor began to revise its manufacturing and procurement strategies to significantly increase outsourcing of wafer fabrication and product testing to overseas subcontractors and to streamline operations 
this change was in response to continuing market conditions that made it more economical to outsource manufacturing 
accordingly  xicor recorded million in restructuring charges in  consisting of million of equipment write offs due to the shifting of activity to an outside wafer foundry and million for severance costs relating to a reduction in workforce 
based on the progress made on the outsourcing program during  in december xicor s board of directors decided to close its milpitas in house wafer fabrication facility by mid and use third party foundries for all of xicor s wafer fabrication production 
in connection with the closure of this facility  which is expected to cease production by mid  xicor recorded a million restructuring charge  consisting of a million non cash write down of the wafer fabrication plant assets  million for severance costs relating to a reduction in workforce  fab closure costs of million  idle facilities charges of million and equipment lease costs of million 
the fabrication facility closure plans provide for production to cease at the facility by mid and closure and decommissioning activities to be conducted over the succeeding nine months 
xicor is currently pursuing the sale of the milpitas manufacturing operations and at this time believes the most likely outcome would be a piecemeal sale of the equipment 
xicor expects that the majority of expenditures relating to the closure and decommissioning of the facility will be incurred during the second half of and are expected to be funded from working capital 
xicor expects annual savings compared to of approximately million in production costs  which are currently recorded as cost of sales  as a result of the closure of the facility 
of this amount  annual savings of approximately million related to reduced depreciation expense will begin to be realized in the first quarter of the balance of the estimated savings which relate principally to lower personnel and manufacturing support costs are expected to be fully realized after the closure of the facility 
the estimated savings are expected to be partially offset by the cost of wafers purchased from the third party foundries 
interest expense decreased in compared to due to normal principal payments of outstanding lease debt 
interest expense was relatively level in compared to due to normal monthly pay downs of debt  offset by additional interest expense associated with equipment financing of million and equipment financing of million 
interest income decreased in both and compared to the prior year due to a decrease in the average balance invested and in  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
no taxes were provided in and due to the net loss 
the provision for income taxes for consisted primarily of federal and state minimum taxes  which resulted from limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards  and foreign taxes 
net deferred tax assets of million at the end of remain fully reserved because of the uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of these assets 
liquidity and capital resources at december   xicor had million in cash and cash equivalents 
corresponding balances at the end of and were million and million  respectively 
in xicor generated million of cash from operating activities and used million to repay long term obligations and million for equipment purchases 
additionally million of cash was generated from employee stock plans 
in xicor used million of cash for operating activities primarily due to the operating loss  million for capital asset purchases and million to repay long term obligations 
during xicor received million from the sale of unregistered common stock to atmi  inc during xicor expects to use cash to fund costs associated with the planned closure of the wafer fabrication plant  to repay long term obligations and purchase equipment and software 
capital expenditures for are currently planned at approximately million and are primarily related to product design  information technology and product testing 
at december   xicor had entered into commitments for equipment purchases aggregating less than million 
xicor has a line of credit agreement with a financial institution that expires march   provides for borrowings of up to million against eligible accounts receivable and is secured by all of xicor s assets 
interest on borrowings is charged at the prime lending rate plus and is payable monthly 
at december   the entire million was available to xicor based on the eligible accounts receivable balances and the borrowing formulas 
to date  no amounts have been borrowed under this line of credit 
at december   million of the line of credit was reserved to secure a standby letter of credit 
management believes that currently available cash and the existing line of credit facility will be adequate to support xicor s operations for the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   as amended by sfas no 
xicor believes that adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
xicor believes that adopting sab will not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding expected annual savings from xicor s plan to close its milpitas in house wafer fabrication facility by mid and use third party foundries for all of xicor s wafer fabrication production  the plans to manufacture wafers at our wafer fabrication plant during the first half of to produce sufficient inventory levels of certain products to prevent delays in meeting customer demands as the foundries ramp up the production of our products  the belief at this time that the most likely outcome of the currently pursued sale of the milpitas manufacturing operations would be a piecemeal sale of the equipment  plans to expand the battery management product line in  and the expectation that sufficient cash  working capital  and credit will be available to fund fiscal year operations  including costs associated with the planned closure of the wafer fabrication plant  repayment of long term obligations and the purchase of equipment and software 
except for historical information  the matters discussed in this annual report are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following  general economic conditions and conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  fluctuations in customer demand  including loss of key customers  order cancellations or reduced bookings  competitive factors such as pricing pressures on existing products and the timing and market acceptance of new product introductions both by xicor and its competitors  xicor s ability to have available an appropriate amount of low cost foundry production capacity in a timely manner  our foundry partners timely ability to successfully manufacture products for xicor using xicor s proprietary technology  any disruptions of our foundry relationships  manufacturing efficiencies  the ability to continue effective cost reductions  currency fluctuations  the timely development and introduction of new products and submicron processes  and the risk factors listed from time to time in xicor s sec reports  including but not limited to the factors affecting future results section following and part i  item of this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
xicor undertakes no obligation to publicly release or otherwise disclose the result of any revision to these forward looking statements that may be made as a result of events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
factors affecting future results our operating results fluctuate significantly  and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business operations 
our recent growth rate may not be sustainable and you should not use our past financial performance to predict future operating results 
we have incurred net losses for the past three fiscal years 
our recent quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  due to the following factors  all of which are difficult to forecast and many of which are out of our control the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  competitive pricing pressures and related changes in selling prices  new product announcements and introductions for competing products by us or our competitors  market acceptance and subsequent design in of new products  unpredictability of changes in demand for  or in the mix of  our products  the timing of significant orders including the fact that the sales level in any specific quarter depends significantly on orders received during that quarter  the gain or loss of significant customers  the availability  timely deliverability and cost of wafers and other materials from our suppliers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and significant yield losses which affect our ability to fulfill orders  product obsolescence  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  exchange rate fluctuations  general economic  political and environmental related conditions  such as natural disasters  difficulties in forecasting  planning and management of inventory levels  and unanticipated research and development expenses associated with new product introductions 
we are in the process of shifting our manufacturing strategy to a fabless business model and will depend on a limited number of foreign foundries to manufacture our products 
these foundries may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which could cause our sales to decline 
we plan to outsource all of our manufacturing by the second half of with the exception of limited testing activities 
during  substantially all of our wafers were manufactured at our wafer fabrication plant in milpitas  california or yamaha corporation in japan 
during we plan to close our wafer fabrication plant in milpitas and ramp up manufacturing at two additional wafer foundries  sanyo in japan and zmd in germany 
if these suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis and at competitive prices we could suffer manufacturing delays  a possible loss of sales and higher than anticipated costs of sales  any of which could seriously harm our operating results 
we could experience problems in the manufacturing process at our wafer fabrication plant prior to closure which would impact the supply of various products  including those built on an old process which will not be installed at the foundries  which we plan to manufacture and cause our sales to decline and costs to increase 
during the first half of  we plan to manufacture wafers at our wafer fabrication plant in milpitas  california to produce sufficient inventory levels of certain products to prevent delays in meeting customer demands as the foundries ramp up the production of our products 
manufacturing problems during the final months of operations of the facility would reduce yields and increase costs 
due to the complex nature of the manufacturing process  some manufacturing problems may not be detected until the products are near completion 
significant yield loss could affect our ability to fulfill orders and result in reduced sales and gross margins 
our cost of sales may increase if we are required to purchase additional manufacturing capacity in the future 
to obtain additional manufacturing capacity  we may be required to make deposits  equipment purchases  loans  enter into joint ventures  equity investments or technology licenses in or with wafer fabrication companies 
these transactions could involve a commitment of substantial amounts of our capital and technology licenses in return for production capacity 
we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to secure this capacity and we may not be able to obtain such financing 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of sales and reduced product availability 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor foundries that supply our wafers have at times experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both design technology and manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from marginal designs or manufacturing process drifts 
yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process  which often makes these problems difficult  time consuming and costly to correct or replace 
furthermore  we rely on independent foreign foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if our foundries fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  we will experience higher costs of sales and reduced product availability  which would harm our operating results 
our dependence on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble and test our products subjects us to a number of risks  including an inadequate supply of products and higher costs of materials 
we depend on independent subcontractors to sort  assemble and test our products 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  limited warranties on products supplied to us  and potential increases in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors  these risks may lead to increased costs  delayed product delivery or loss of competitive advantage  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we therefore have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
consequently  our operating results will be harmed if our sales do not meet our revenue projections 
we may experience revenue shortfalls for the following reasons significant pricing pressures that occur because of declines in selling prices over the life of a product  sudden shortages of raw materials or fabrication  sort  test or assembly capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers which  in turn  harm our ability to meet our sales obligations  and the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders 
in addition  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside suppliers and foundries  we may order materials and produce finished products in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering and production may result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize 
because our products typically have lengthy sales cycles  we may experience substantial delays between incurring expenses related to research and development and the generation of sales 
due to the length of the product design in cycle we usually require more than nine months to realize volume shipments after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take three months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation process and begin to ramp up production  a period which typically lasts an additional six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our research and development efforts and our realization of revenue  if any  from volume purchasing of our products by our customers 
we face intense competition from companies with significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources that could adversely affect our ability to increase sales of our products 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies such as atmel corporation  st microelectronics  dallas semiconductor  maxim and texas instruments  all of whom have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors have their own facilities for the production of semiconductor components and have recently added significant capacity for such production 
in addition  we may in the future experience direct competition from our foundry partners 
some of our foundry partners have the right to fabricate certain products based on our process technology and co developed circuit design  and to sell such products worldwide 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change and  therefore  our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  and rapid product obsolescence 
to develop new products for our target markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to expand our technical and design expertise 
in addition  we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet their rapidly changing needs 
products for communications applications are based on continually evolving industry standards 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these industry standards 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify new product opportunities successfully  develop and bring to market new products at competitive costs  achieve design wins or respond effectively to new technological changes or product announcements by our competitors 
furthermore  we may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense 
failure in any of these areas could harm our operating results 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key design  engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify  recruit and retain personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular for the highly skilled engineers involved in the development of our products 
competition is especially intense in silicon valley  where our design  research and development  and corporate headquarters are located 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employ in the future 
the failure to recruit and retain key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could harm our business 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  which we may not be able to do successfully 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and mask work production laws and rights  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
policing unauthorized use of our products  however  is difficult  especially in foreign countries 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
we hold numerous united states patents and corresponding foreign patents covering various circuit designs and the structure of its devices 
further  additional patent applications for such products are pending in the united states and abroad 
however  patents granted or pending may not provide us with any meaningful protection 
our operating results could be seriously harmed by the failure to be able to protect our intellectual property 
if we are accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other parties  we may become subject to time consuming and costly litigation 
if we lose or settle claims  we could suffer a significant impact on our business and be forced to pay damages 
third parties have and may continue to assert that our products infringe their proprietary rights  or may assert claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims against us 
any such claims may cause us to delay or cancel shipment of our products or pay damages that could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  we could incur significant costs in defending against such claims 
we have received notices claiming infringement of patents from several semiconductor manufacturers with respect to certain aspects of our processes and devices and these matters are under investigation and review 
although patent holders typically offer licenses and we have entered into such license agreements  we may not be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms  and disputes may not be resolved without costly litigation 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales and operations 
our international sales accounted for approximately of sales in  in  and in our international business activities are subject to a number of risks  any of which could impose unexpected costs on us that would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in complying with regulatory requirements and standards  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
because a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our sales  our sales could decline significantly due to the loss of one of these customers 
during  of our sales came from two customers 
one distributor accounted for of our sales and one oem customer accounted for of our sales 
distributors are not themselves end users  but rather serve as a channel of sale to many end users of our products 
if we were to lose either of these customers or experience any substantial reduction in orders from these customers  our sales and operating results could suffer 
in addition  the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers products change 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and the loss of a major customer could seriously harm our business 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
an early termination or delay in shipments by one of our major customers would harm our financial results as it is unlikely that we would be able to rapidly replace that revenue source 
our backlog may not result in future revenue  which would seriously harm our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenue  could harm our business 
if an earthquake or other natural disaster strikes our manufacturing facility or those of our foundries or other manufacturing subcontractors  we would be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and we would experience lost sales 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our foundries and suppliers are located near fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster near our headquarters  our operations could be harmed 
similarly  a major earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of our major manufacturing subcontractors could disrupt the operations of those subcontractors  which could limit the supply of our products and harm our business 
xicor has been unable to obtain earthquake insurance at reasonable costs and limits 
if we did not adequately prepare for the transition to the year  our business could be harmed 
xicor uses a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems and intelligent hardware devices in its internal operations  including information technology it systems and non it systems used in the design  manufacture and marketing of company products 
xicor completed all year readiness work and to date has not experienced disruption in its business related to the year issue 
however  xicor cannot provide any assurance that no year issues will impact its it and non it systems or other aspects of its business in the future 
xicor s key suppliers have not experienced major disruptions in their businesses related to the year issue 
however  xicor cannot provide any assurance that no year issue will affect our suppliers in the future 
we may require additional capital in order to bring new products to market  and the issuance of new equity securities will dilute your investment in our common stock 
to implement our strategy of diversified product offerings  we need to bring new products to market 
bringing new products to market and ramping up production requires significant working capital 
we have in place a credit agreement with coast business credit corporation to provide up to million of additional capital to support potential ongoing working capital requirements 
we may need to borrow under this credit facility at some time 
we may also sell additional shares of our stock or seek additional borrowings or outside capital infusions 
we cannot assure you that such financing options will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  if we issue shares of our common stock  our shareholders will experience dilution with respect to their investment 
we depend on manufacturers representatives and distributors to generate a majority of our sales 
we rely on manufacturers representatives and distributors to sell our products and these entities could discontinue selling our products at any time 
the loss of any significant manufacturers representative or distributor could seriously harm our operating results by impairing our ability to sell our products 
the selling prices for our products are volatile and have historically declined over the life of a product 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry could create fluctuations in our operating results  as we experienced in and the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
downturns of this type occurred in and these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices  and in some cases have lasted for more than a year 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors  including manufacturers of computers  telecommunications equipment  automotive electronics  industrial controls  consumer electronics  data networking and military equipment  and a better supply and demand balance within the industry 
our business could be harmed in the future by cyclical conditions in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth in any of the markets served by our customer products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk xicor does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
xicor has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as held to maturity securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
xicor attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of xicor s investment portfolio a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on xicor s operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
xicor is exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
xicor generally has not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and or result in operating losses
