business class loads were up significantly versus last year 
adjustments in pricing and inventory strategies also led to gains in leisure traffic 
yield the average amount a passenger pays to fly one mile increased by  year over year  from cents to cents 
unit revenue increased  from cents to cents in and  respectively better improvements than any major airline in the industry 
our traffic  or revenue passenger miles rpms  increased or million on a increase in capacity  or available seat miles asms 
for the year ended december   load factor increased points to versus for the year ended december  however  we continue to experience strong competition that could negatively impact future loads and yields 
other revenue increased  or million  this year compared to last year due to the million gain from a litigation settlement 
operating expenses excluding the impairment charges in and  operating expenses increased million or year over year 
our operating cost per asm  excluding impairment charges  increased to cents from cents a year ago 
salaries  wages and benefits increased  or million  due to a increase in overall headcount and contractual wage increases for our union represented labor groups 
aircraft fuel expense decreased year over year by million  or  due to a decrease in the average fuel cost per gallon offset by a increase in fuel consumption 
maintenance increased or million  due to a volume increase of five check lines as a result of completing our structural life improvement program  and six additional engine overhauls 
the timing of maintenance to be performed is determined by the number of hours an aircraft and engine are flown 
commissions paid to travel agents increased million or due to an increase in commissionable sales  offset by a rate reduction from to during the second quarter of and a further reduction to during the fourth quarter of landing fees and other rents increased million compared to the year ended due to increased departures 
we operated more departures in than  at  and  respectively 
aircraft rent decreased million in from due to the return of five leased b aircraft throughout the year 
other operating expenses decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decline of credit card chargebacks and communications costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to accelerate the retirement of our owned dc fleet to accommodate the introduction of the b fleet 
in connection with our decision to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft  we performed an evaluation to determine  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of these aircraft and related assets 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount  and therefore these aircraft are impaired as defined by sfas no 
consequently  the original cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date the decision was made  resulting in a million impairment charge 
we considered recent transactions and market trends involving similar aircraft in determining the fair market value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non operating expenses interest expense  net of interest income  increased due to the november   issuance of million of debt for financing ten b aircraft 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense was million and in and  respectively 
the tax expense results from the utilization of a portion of our million of net operating loss nol carryforwards  existing at december   offset in part by alternative minimum tax and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation nol carryforwards 
we have not recognized any benefit from the use beyond of nol carryforwards because our evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of tax benefits of such loss carryforwards indicates that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contain risks that do not provide sufficient assurance to recognize such tax benefits currently 
compared to summary our results of operations for are not reflective of the results to be expected in future periods 
this comes as a result of reduced service levels during the year of  incremental costs incurred to reinitiate service to certain markets and to reactivate aircraft taken out of service and the merger of airways corporation into our company in november our financial results include the operations of airways corporation only from and after november   the date of the merger 
we recorded a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impairment charge of million  we recorded a net loss of million  or cents per share  in versus a net loss of million  excluding a charge of million related to rebranding and shutdown costs  or per share  in excluding the special items previously mentioned  our operating income increased million  from an operating loss of million in to operating income of million in our operating margin in was versus an operating margin deficit of in operating revenues passenger revenues in were million as compared to million for the year ending december  the increase is principally due to an increase in revenue passengers enplaned and a increase in revenue passenger miles 
our yield the average amount that a passenger pays to fly one mile increased  year over year  from cents to cents 
our rpms increased  or billion  on an increase in asms 
for the year ended december   load factor increased points to versus for the twelve months ended december  cargo revenue increased  from million in to million in due to an increase in capacity 
other revenues increased  or million  in compared to due to the increase in revenue passengers enplaned 
operating expenses excluding the impairment charge in and rebranding and shutdown and other nonrecurring charges in  operating expenses increased million or 
our operating cost per asm decreased to cents from cents in labor costs increased from million in to million in primarily due to contractual wage increases for our union represented labor groups and the acquisition of airways corporation on november  aircraft fuel increased primarily due to the increase in consumption related to increased service levels  offset by a decrease in price per gallon in from cents per gallon cents per gallon 
maintenance costs increased due to additional check lines and engine overhauls principally resulting from an increase in the number of operating aircraft from at december  to at december  commissions expense increased largely due to the increase in passenger volume and the increase of travel agency bookings through the airline reporting corporation arc  which we joined in september landing fees and other rents increased  from million in to million in  due to a increase in number of departures 
marketing and advertising increased from million in to million in however  as a percentage of revenue  marketing and advertising decreased percentage points from in to in  which is more in line with industry standards 
aircraft rent increased from million in to million in due to a full year of b rent expense versus only six weeks of aircraft rent expense recognized after the acquisition of airways corporation in november depreciation expense remained flat year over year 
additional capital spending increased depreciation million offset by a million reduction due to revising the salvage values of our dc equipment 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses increased  or million  in as compared to  primarily as a result of increases in passenger and aircraft servicing expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to accelerate the retirement of four owned boeing b aircraft as a result of the elimination of their original route system and continued operating losses upon their redeployment to other routes 
the bs are intended to be replaced with b aircraft 
in connection with our decision to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft  which were acquired in the acquisition of airways corporation  we performed an evaluation to determine  in accordance with sfas no 
 whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of these aircraft and related assets and an allocation of cost in excess of net assets acquired resulting from the acquisition of airways corporation 
sfas no 
requires that when a group of assets being tested for impairment was acquired as part of a business combination that was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  any cost in excess of net assets acquired that arose as part of the transaction must be included as part of the asset grouping 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount and allocated cost in excess of net assets acquired  and therefore these aircraft are impaired as defined by sfas no 
consequently  the original cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date the decision was made  resulting in a million impairment loss 
we considered recent transactions and market trends involving similar aircraft in determining the fair market value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we incurred million of costs attributable to rebranding the airline and shutdown and other nonrecurring costs attributable to the continued effects of the reduced schedule after the suspension of operations 
no such costs were incurred during non operating expenses interest expense  net  increased million primarily due to the decrease in interest income earned from excess cash as a result of cash and cash equivalents decreasing from million at december  to million at december we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of operating loss carryforwards because our evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the tax benefits of such loss carryforwards indicates that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contain risks that do not provide sufficient assurance to recognize such tax benefits currently 
our income tax benefit was and million in and  respectively 
the benefit recorded in was the result of operating loss carryback claims 
outlook for during  we celebrated many accomplishments on our return to profitability 
the accomplishments include  but are not limited to 
four quarters of profitability exclusive of impairment loss in fourth quarter and litigation settlement gain 
significant improvement in cash balance 
introduction and delivery of eight b aircraft 
awarded of department of defense contract awards in which we bid estimated to be worth nearly million per year 
significant revenue per asm growth compared to the industry we expect to be another good year for our airline 
we will benefit from the travel agent commission reduction from to  reduced maintenance costs per block hour and reduced depreciation expense as a result of the impairment loss 
we are exposed to high jet fuel prices without the benefit of a significant hedge 
higher interest expense is also a risk we will face in we are incurring higher interest expense due to aircraft financing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that attractive financing will be available when we seek to refinance our million of debt due in april year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
liquidity and capital resources we rely primarily on operating cash flows to provide working capital 
we have no lines of credit or other facilities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and working capital deficit of million compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  and  respectively 
we generally must satisfy all of our working capital expenditure requirements from cash provided by operating activities  from external capital sources or from the sale of assets 
substantial portions of our assets have been pledged to secure various issues of our outstanding indebtedness 
to the extent that the pledged assets are sold  the applicable financing agreements generally require the sales proceeds to be applied to repay the corresponding indebtedness 
to the extent that our access to capital is constrained  we may not be able to make certain capital expenditures or to continue to implement certain other aspects of our strategic plan  and we may therefore be unable to achieve the full benefits expected therefrom 
based on the favorable economic conditions of the us airline industry  we expect to be able to generate positive working capital through our operations  however  we cannot predict whether the current favorable economic trends and conditions will continue  or the effects of competition or other factors  such as increased fuel prices  that are beyond our control 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents increased from december  by million 
operating activities generated million in cash 
investing activities used cash of million primarily related to the acquisition of eight b aircraft and several dc hush kits 
financing activities generated cash of million in connection with issuance of debt for the acquisition of ten b aircraft offset by long term debt payments 
as of december   our operating fleet consisted of dc aircraft  four b aircraft and eight b aircraft 
we returned five leased b aircraft and grounded six stage dc and b aircraft during we have contracted with boeing for the purchase of b aircraft for delivery from to of which eight had been delivered as of december  during the third quarter of  we reached an agreement with boeing to defer the remaining progress payments until the first delivery  which occurred in september progress payments resumed in september and we paid million in progress payments through december there can be no assurance that cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet the progress payments for the bs 
if we exercise our option to acquire up to an additional b aircraft  additional payments could be required beginning in we expect to finance at least of the cost of each of these aircraft 
we completed a private placement of million  enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs on november  the proceeds will be used to purchase the first ten b aircraft 
the eetcs bear interest at per annum and are payable in semi annual installments from april   through april  although boeing has agreed to provide financing support with respect to the remaining aircraft to be acquired  we will be required to obtain the financing from other sources 
we believe that with the support to be provided by boeing  aircraft related debt financing should be available when needed 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on attractive terms  if at all 
if we are unable to secure acceptable financing  we could be required to modify our aircraft acquisition plans or to incur higher than anticipated financing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
on november   we announced our decision to accelerate the retirement of the dc fleet to accommodate the introduction of the b fleet 
the accelerated retirement allows for a more moderate capacity growth and resulted in a non cash pretax fleet disposition charge of million during the fourth quarter of as of december   our debt related to asset financing totaled million  with respect to which aircraft and certain other equipment are pledged as security 
included in such amount is million of senior secured notes due april under which interest is payable semi annually and the million of enhanced equipment trust certificates  of which a portion of interest and principal is payable semi annually 
in addition  we have million of senior notes outstanding 
the principal balance of the senior notes is due in april and interest is payable semi annually 
the entire principal amount of the senior notes million and senior secured notes million will become due on april  we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay all million of such debt by its due date 
accordingly  we will likely need to refinance all or a portion of the outstanding debt through additional equity or debt or a combination thereof 
the ability to refinance our debt depends on our future performance and financial results 
such results are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that are  to some extent  beyond our control 
all of our debt has final maturities ranging from to with scheduled debt payments as of december  as follows million  million  million  million  million and thereafter million 
certain debt bears interest at rates ranging from to per annum and is repayable in consecutive monthly or quarterly installments over a four to seven year period 
one of these notes  with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately million as of december   has a variable rate of interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus to 
due to the competitive nature of the airline industry  in the event of any increase in the price of jet fuel  there can be no assurance that we would be able to pass on increased fuel prices to our customers by increasing fares

interest rates as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  aircraft fuel our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
excluding the impairment charges  aircraft fuel accounted for and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
based on our projected fuel consumption  a ten percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel at december  would increase fuel expense for the next twelve months by approximately million  net of hedging instruments outstanding at december  comparatively  based on fuel usage  a increase in fuel prices would have resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million  net of hedging instruments utilized during the increase in market risk is primarily due to our fuel hedging contracts covering significantly more fuel requirements in than in in  we entered into fixed rate swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments in order to manage the price risk and utilization of fuel cost 
at december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements for the first six months of
