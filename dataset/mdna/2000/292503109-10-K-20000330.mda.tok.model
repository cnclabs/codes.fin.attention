the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net sales  various consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated 
consolidated statements of income net sales cost of sales gross profit marketing and selling research and development general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations interest income net other income income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss results of operations years ended december  and our net sales increased over net sales 
this increase was due to strong sales generally throughout our gap printer product line 
in  supplies sales decreased from  and accounted for approximately of net sales versus in the decrease in supplies sales was due primarily to our de emphasis of lower margin media products 
we plan to continue to focus our supplies selling efforts on higher margin ink products 
an increase in oem performance also contributed to the overall increase in net sales for  accounting for of product sales during both and one customer accounted for of product sales in while no one customer accounted for of product sales in international sales accounted for approximately and of our product sales in and  respectively 
cost of sales includes standard costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor and overhead  inventory reserves and manufacturing variances  and other direct or allocated costs involved in the manufacture  delivery  support and maintenance of products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  causing a comparable increase in gross margin percentages 
during we incurred total charges of  related to inventory and related charges for unprofitable products  including croma and several lines of media 
this improvement reflects the result of our efforts to reduce material costs  as well as the higher gross margins we are realizing on our newly introduced products 
our future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop and manufacture competitive higher margin products and achieve cost reductions for our existing products 
marketing and selling expenses were of net sales compared to in and decreased by in absolute dollars from this decrease was due to decreased spending for advertising and tradeshows and an overall decrease in spending as a result of the consolidation of our supplies and textile business units into our core business 
research and development spending grew by in absolute dollars over and remained flat at as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in spending was driven by new product development 
we expect to continue to invest significant resources in our strategic programs and enhancements to existing products and consequently expect that research and development expenses will remain at levels consistent with prior periods 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared to in this decrease was primarily related to a lower amount of bad debt expense and lower staffing costs offset somewhat by higher than normal legal expenses associated with litigation  which is more fully described in the section of this report entitled legal proceedings 
there was no significant other income in the product development and manufacturing license agreement signed in was terminated in interest expense in totaled compared to in decreased borrowings under our line of credit arrangement caused the decrease in interest expense 
interest income in totaled compared to in the effective income tax rate in was  compared to in the higher rate was due primarily to the recording of the deferred tax asset allowance previously described in the previously described elements caused net income to stand at  compared to a net loss of  years ended december  and our net sales decreased from net sales 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased unit sales and average selling prices across all printer product lines  with the exception of the novajet pro e which was introduced in may also contributing to the decline was the introduction of various rebate programs which were required to match competitive offerings 
in  supplies sales increased over  and accounted for approximately of net sales versus in a shortfall in oem performance also contributed to the decrease in net sales for  accounting for of product sales as compared to for no one customer accounted for of product sales in either or international sales accounted for approximately and of our product sales in and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in  causing a comparable decrease in gross margin percentages 
the increase in the cost of sales was due to a large increase to inventory reserves related to selected unprofitable media product lines  croma  and products which are reaching end of life status  unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances  and the write off of various croma assets 
also contributing to the increased cost of sales percentage were the decrease in average selling price and the implementation of rebate programs previously discussed 
marketing and selling expenses were of net sales compared to in and grew by in absolute dollars over most of the increase was related to costs associated with increased staffing  primarily in the supplies and textiles areas  offset by decreases in advertising and trade show activity compared to research and development spending grew by in absolute dollars over and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in spending was driven by new product development 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared to in the increase in absolute dollars was due in large part to the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we increased the allowance to reflect the worsening accounts receivable balances of a few specific customers  the gradual worsening condition of balances of some asian and european customers  and our adoption of a more conservative method in assessing the creditworthiness of our smaller customers 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a  restructuring charge to cover the planned cost of our reorganization and related workforce reduction 
these charges reflect steps we took to consolidate business units  focus on niche markets  and improve future growth and profitability 
other income for the year ended december  included payments received under a product development and manufacturing license agreement signed during the first quarter of under this agreement  we assisted in the development of a wide format color inkjet product targeted for markets outside of our focus 
we received additional reimbursements for engineering expenses 
interest expense in totaled compared to in increased borrowings under our line of credit arrangement caused the increase in interest expense 
interest income in totaled compared to in the effective income tax rate in was  compared to in the low rate was due primarily to the recording of the deferred tax asset allowance in as previously described 
the previously described elements caused net loss to stand at  compared to a net income of  liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily through cash flow provided from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  in comparison  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the net income before depreciation and amortization of  a reduction in inventory of  and a reduction in income taxes receivable of  offset by a  paydown of our line of credit and capital expenditures of  we have received and anticipate we will continue to receive the majority of our cash from collections of accounts receivable from our distributors  dealers  vars and oems 
these groups in general have a history of timely payments  however  an increasing percentage of international sales can increase accounts receivable balances due to traditionally slower payments by international customers 
at december   net accounts receivable increased by  over s year end balance of  the increase was related to increased sales in and  more directly  increased sales in the fourth quarter of we invest our excess cash in money market accounts and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates 
we have not experienced  to date  any losses on our short term investments 
during  we invested cash in short term investments which generated interest income of inventory levels decreased by  at december  from  at the end of this decrease was primarily attributable to a more focused effort to reduce finished goods inventories while maintaining required availability to meet demand 
in the years ended december  and  we made capital expenditures of  and  respectively 
expenditures included consulting and other expenses related to the initial implementation of the enterprise wide information system software purchased in during  we plan to increase our capital expenditures  especially for computers and related systems  and tooling relating to new products 
at december   the company had available a  revolving line of credit which expired in january the bank has agreed to extend the maturity date of the line until april   at which time we plan to replace it with another line 
the line bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or at the company s option  a rate based on the london interbank overnight rate at december  plus on outstanding balances 
the company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line 
the line is secured by specified assets with a borrowing base limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
in addition  the availability of the line is subject to our maintaining financial covenants including working capital and tangible net worth ratios 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december  and  was outstanding under a prior agreement with the same bank at december  the company is currently negotiating a new line of credit with a new bank 
in january  we received cash proceeds of approximately  for a transaction in which we sold our headquarters property in san diego  california  and leased the property back for a period of seven years 
the leaseback will be accounted for as an operating lease 
the transaction resulted in a gain of  which will be deferred and amortized over the term of the lease 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash generated  and funds available under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs 
actual cash requirements may vary from planned amounts  depending on the timing of the launch and extent of acceptance of new products 
there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require us to seek additional capital  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to us 
to date  inflation has not had a significant effect on our operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our only financial instruments with market risk exposure are domestic revolving line of credit borrowings  of which no amounts were outstanding at december  the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based upon our cash requirements 
maximum borrowings at any fiscal quarter end during fiscal were  based on the outstanding balance at december   an adverse change in the interest rate underlying these borrowings would result in no annual change in our pre tax earnings and cash flow 
these instruments are non trading in nature and carry interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or at our option  a rate based on the london interbank overnight rate at december  plus 
our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
foreign currency risk 
we conduct business on a global basis and all of our products sold in international markets are denominated in us dollars 
historically  export sales have represented a significant portion of our sales and we expect export sale to continue to represent a significant portion of our sales 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to currency exchange fluctuations  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  collecting accounts receivable  restrictions on the export of critical technology  changes in tariffs  trade restrictions  export license requirements  political instability  and the imposition of government controls 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our sales offices in france  germany  the united kingdom  china and japan  incur costs which are denominated in local currencies 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our results was not material
