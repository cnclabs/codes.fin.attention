item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leader in the emerging field of proteomics and gene based medicine focusing on the development of therapeutic and molecular diagnostic products 
we have developed  and will continue to expand upon  a number of proprietary proteomic databases which permit us  through the use of our bioinformatics and robotics technologies  to identify human genes and related proteins that may play a role in the onset or progression of major human diseases 
we formed two wholly owned subsidiaries  myriad pharmaceuticals  inc and myriad genetic laboratories  inc  to commercialize our therapeutic and molecular diagnostic discoveries 
myriad pharmaceuticals  inc independently and in conjunction with collaborative partners  focuses on the discovery and development of therapeutic products 
myriad genetic laboratories  inc focuses on the development of molecular diagnostic products that access a person s risk of developing a specific disease and permits physicians and their patients to take appropriate health care measures to reduce the risk 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to maintaining our research and development programs  supporting collaborative research agreements  operating a molecular diagnostic laboratory  establishing genomic sequencing  establishing high throughput screening  and undertaking drug discovery and development 
our revenues have consisted primarily of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements  upfront fees  milestone payments  and sales of molecular diagnostic products 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for the year ended june   we had a net loss of  and as of june  had an accumulated deficit of  in april  we commenced a five year collaborative research and development arrangement with novartis corporation 
the total equity investment  research funding and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  the research phase of the novartis collaboration concluded successfully on schedule in april we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by novartis 
in september  we commenced a five year collaborative research and development arrangement with bayer corporation 
the total equity investment  research funding and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  in november and again in december  we announced expansions of our collaborative research and development arrangement with bayer 
the expanded collaboration may provide us with additional research funding and potential milestone payments of up to  we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by bayer 
in october  we announced the introduction of bracanalysis r  a comprehensive brca and brca gene sequence analysis for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer 
in january  we announced the introduction of cardiarisk r  which may assist physicians both in identifying which hypertensive patients are at a significantly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and identifying which patients are likely to respond to low salt diet therapy and antihypertensive drug therapy 
in august  we announced the future launch of colaris tm  a predicitive medicine test for hereditary colon cancer and uterine cancer 
we plan to begin accepting colaris tm samples in the fall of we  through our wholly owned subsidiary myriad genetic laboratories  inc  recognized molecular diagnostic revenues  primarily from bracanalysis r  of  for the year ended june  in april  we commenced a three year collaborative research and development arrangement with schering plough corporation 
the total equity investment  research funding  license fees and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  the research phase of the schering plough collaboration concluded successfully on schedule in april we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by schering plough 
in october  we entered into a five year collaboration with schering ag to utilize our protein interaction technology  pronet r  for drug discovery and development 
under the agreement  we will have an option to co promote all new therapeutic products in north america and receive of the profits from north american sales of all new drugs discovered with pronet r 
the total research funding  license fees  subscription fees  option payments and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  if we choose to co promote a drug developed by schering ag as a partner  we may be required to pay funds to schering ag to establish equal ownership 
in november  we entered into a month collaboration with pharmacia corporation formerly monsanto company to utilize pronet r for drug discovery and development 
in december  pharmacia exercised its option to extend the research term for an additional months and exercised its option to expand the research funding 
the total research funding  option payments  license fees and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by pharmacia 
in july  we entered into a two year collaboration and license agreement with the novartis agricultural discovery institute  inc the genomic collaboration will focus on the discovery of the genetic structure of cereal crops 
the total funding under this collaboration is expected to provide us with  upon completion  we intend to jointly offer with nadii commercial access to the genomic databases and share equally in any resulting proceeds 
in october  we announced the expansion of our collaboration with schering ag to include research in the field of cardiovascular disease 
we also entered into a securities purchase agreement and a standstill agreement with schering berlin venture corporation to sell to schering berlin  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  in december  we entered into a month collaboration with hoffmann laroche inc to utilize pronet r for drug discovery and development in the area of cardiovascular disease 
the total research funding  license fees and potential milestone payments under this collaboration may provide us with up to  in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by roche 
in may  we entered into a three year strategic alliance with hitachi ltd 
under the terms of the agreement  we will work with hitachi to exploit the pronet r technology together in japan and hitachi will establish a designated pronet r facility to expedite the discovery of novel protein protein interactions for japanese customers 
total research and license payments under this collaboration are expected to provide us with  in addition  we are entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products commercialized by hitachi 
we intend to enter into additional collaborative relationships to locate and sequence genes and discover protein networks associated with other common diseases as well as to continue to fund internal research projects 
we may be unable to enter into additional collaborative relationships on terms acceptable to us 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to expansion of our research and development programs  expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  increased staffing costs and expansion of our facilities 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our molecular diagnostic business 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
results of operations years ended june  and research revenues for our fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase of in our research revenue is primarily attributable to revenue recognized from the nadii collaboration that began in july  the roche collaboration which began in december  and the hitachi collaboration which began in may research revenue from the research collaboration agreements is generally recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues increase or decrease proportionately 
molecular diagnostic revenues of  were recognized in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of or  over the prior year 
molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised of sales of molecular diagnostic tests resulting from our discovery of disease genes 
sales and marketing efforts since that time  together with increased demand as a result of wider acceptance of the test by the medical community  have given rise to the increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance  however that molecular diagnostic revenues will continue to increase at the historical rate 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research activities as a result of our recent collaborations with nadii  roche  and hitachi as well as those programs we fund internally 
the increased level of research spending also includes the ongoing drug discovery efforts of myriad pharmaceuticals  our wholly owned subsidiary  continued development and utilization of pronet  and third party sponsored research programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ongoing promotion of our molecular diagnostic business including preparations for the launch of colaris  a predictive medicine test for hereditary colon and uterine cancer scheduled to be available in the fall of increased costs also resulted from the establishment of international license agreements and the related costs of increasing our infrastructure to support increased molecular diagnostic testing volumes 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate as needed in support of our molecular diagnostic business and our research and development efforts 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities were  at june  as compared to  at june  this increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities was primarily attributable to the private sale of approximately  worth of our common stock during the year  as well as receipt of license payments  milestone payments and advance research payments from our collaborators 
these cash receipts were offset by expenditures we incurred in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of our increased cash position  interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the loss on disposition of assets of  in the fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of our retiring unproductive assets 
years ended june  and research revenues for the company s fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  greater research revenue recognized during the fiscal year ended june  versus the fiscal year ended june  is the result of  in research milestones and contract expansion payments we received excluding the milestone and contract expansion payments  our ongoing research revenue increased  for the fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal research revenue from the research collaboration agreements is generally recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues increase or decrease proportionately 
molecular diagnostic revenues of  were recognized in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of or  over the fiscal year ended june  molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised of sales of diagnostic tests resulting from the our discovery of disease genes 
we launched the test for genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer in october and we launched the test for heart disease and hypertension risk in january sales and marketing efforts since that time have given rise to the increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research activities as a result of our collaborations with novartis  bayer  schering  schering ag  and pharmacia  as well as those programs we funded internally 
the increased level of research spending includes ongoing development of the company s pronet tm and mutation screening technologies  third party sponsored research programs  and the formation of myriad pharmaceuticals  inc myriad pharmaceuticals 
myriad pharmaceuticals  our wholly owned subsidiary  was created to develop therapeutic lead compounds for selected common diseases with large potential markets that are under served by current therapeutic options 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased  from the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   we pursued a plan to dramatically increase our sales force 
start up expenses for the sales staff included training  relocation  and sales supplies 
for the fiscal year ended june   we maintained a steady  well trained sales force which resulted in fewer selling expenses 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   we incurred significant expenses in defense of our intellectual property  including the successful settlement of legal actions with oncormed 
such expenses were drastically reduced during the fiscal year ended june  interest income for the fiscal year ended june  decreased to  from  for the fiscal year ended june  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities were  at june  as compared to  at june  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities was attributable to expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business and has resulted in reduced interest income 
interest expense for the year ended june   amounting to  was due entirely to borrowings under the company s equipment financing facility 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  used during the prior year 
trade receivables increased  between june  and june  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenue during fiscal trade receivables as a percentage of molecular diagnostic revenue continues to be in the range for both june  and june  other receivables decreased  during the fiscal year ended june  primarily as a result of our receipt of collaborative partner payments for research work performed in the prior year 
prepaid expenses increased  during the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily due to advance payments to purchase lab supplies at a discount  advanced royalties  and insurance premiums 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by  during the fiscal year ended june  primarily as a result of our efforts to manage cash flows and extend payment terms as well as increased accrued year end payroll related expenses  and accrued broker fees 
deferred revenue  representing the difference in collaborative payments we have received and research revenue which we have recognized  increased by  during the fiscal year ended june  in large part due to upfront payments from nadii and hitachi as well as marketing license fees we received from recent molecular diagnostic license agreements 
the company s investing activities used  of cash in the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of  in the fiscal year ended june  investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures for research equipment  office furniture  and facility improvements and changes to marketable investment securities 
during the fiscal year ended june   we invested cash received from private equity placements  collaborative research payments  upfront payments  milestone payments  marketing license payments and molecular diagnostic sales to short term and long term investments in order to take advantage of higher interest rates 
these funds were invested in accordance with our investment guidelines as established by our board of directors 
financing activities provided  during the fiscal year ended june  we recognized proceeds from three separate financings during the year 
in september  we entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares our unregistered common stock for a purchase price of  in conjunction with the subscription agreement  we issued a year warrant to purchase an additional  shares at a premium of 
in october  we entered into a securities purchase agreement and a standstill agreement with schering berlin to sell to schering berlin  shares of unregistered common stock 
schering berlin agreed to acquire the shares for an aggregate purchase price of  in june  we sold  shares of unregistered common stock to a european pharmaceutical company that resulted in proceeds of  we have no obligation to register the shares associated with the september financing and the june financing with the securities and exchange commission 
additional cash was provided from the exercise of stock options during the fiscal year ended june  we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including 
the progress of our research and development programs  
the progress of our drug discovery and drug development programs  
the cost of developing and launching additional molecular diagnostic tests  
the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  
the costs associated with competing technological and market developments  
the payments received under collaborative agreements and changes in collaborative research relationships  
the costs associated with potential commercialization of our gene discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  and 
the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures and administrative and legal expenses 
because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
subsequent events in august  we announced a stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend of one new share for each share of common stock outstanding 
the record date for the split was set as august  and the distribution date was set as september  all references to the number of common shares and per share amounts in this annual report on form k have been restated to reflect the effect of the split for all periods presented 
in august  we also closed on an equity financing with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
we sold  shares of our common stock to acqua wellington for gross proceeds in excess of million 
we have agreed to register these shares with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy 
the primary objectives of the company s investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for the company s investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the company s investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified either as available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held to maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
the securities held in the company s investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the available for sale securities 
after a review of the company s marketable securities as of june   the company has determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of the company s marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements as a whole 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations some of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of in some cases you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  potential  continue  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  and similar expressions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
we caution investors that actual results may vary significantly and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the following intense competition related to the discovery of disease related genes and the possibility that others may discover  and we may not be able to gain rights with respect to  genes important to the establishment of a successful genetic testing business  difficulties inherent in developing genetic tests once genes have been discovered  our limited experience in operating a genetic testing laboratory  our limited marketing and sales experience and the risk that tests which we have or may develop may not be marketed at acceptable prices or receive commercial acceptance in the markets that we are targeting or expect to target  uncertainty as to whether there will exist adequate reimbursement for our services from government  private healthcare insurers and third party payors  uncertainties as to the extent of future government regulation of our business  uncertainties as to whether we and our collaborators will be successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for  and commercial acceptance of  therapeutics based on the discovery of disease related genes and proteins  uncertainties as to our ability to develop therapeutic lead compounds  which is a new business area for us  and the risk that markets will not exist for therapeutic lead compounds that we develop or if such markets exist  that we will not be able to sell compounds which we develop at acceptable prices 
these forward looking statements are made as of the date of this report  and we assume no obligation to update them or to explain the reasons why actual results may differ 
in light of these assumptions  risks  and uncertainties  the results and events discussed in the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k might not occur
