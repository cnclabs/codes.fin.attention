item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this discussion and analysis we explain our general financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  we analyze and explain the significant annual changes in the consolidated results of operations as well as significant annual changes for our retail  portfolio and corporate segments 
as you read this discussion  you should refer to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page  which contain our financial condition at december  and and the results of our operations for years ended december    and overview we have experienced a number of significant events during the past three years 
some of the more important events follow during we o completed a private placement of common stock in february generating million in cash  o completed a conversion of one of our loan servicing systems 
we experienced various transitional problems with the conversion  which resulted in a charge of million approximately million net of income taxes to write down our residuals in finance receivables sold  o completed three significant acquisitions and developed new dealerships to increase our total number of dealerships in operation from eight at december  to at december   and o expanded our dealership chain from two markets to ten markets at the end of during we o closed our branch office network  resulting in two significant charges to discontinued operations totaling million  approximately million  net of income taxes an additional charge of million net of income taxes was taken in the fourth quarter of  o completed the conversion of our retail operations to a single computer system  o developed new dealerships to increase our total number of dealerships in operation from at december  to at december   and o completed an exchange offer whereby we issued million in subordinated debentures and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock 
during we o completed the conversion of loan portfolio administration  accounting and financial reporting  and collections to a single computer system  o completed two acquisitions and developed new dealerships to increase our total number of dealerships in operation from at december  to at december   o completed the sale of cygnet dealer finance  inc to cygnet capital corporation  an affiliate of mr 
garcia  and o adopted a formal plan to discontinue the operations of our cygnet servicing subsidiary operations 
other significant developments the company uses securitization of its loan portfolio as a significant source of capital to finance its growth 
historically we have applied two methods in structuring these transactions that result in materially different accounting entries on our books 
as financial results reported herein include periods where both securitization structures were utilized  the following explanation is provided to facilitate an understanding of the material impact these separate structures have had on financial results 
september  and prior 
for the securitization transactions closed in the third quarter of and prior  we structured and recorded these transactions for accounting purposes using what we refer to as the gain on sale method 
the computation of amounts reported as gain on sale income is equal to the difference between the sales proceeds for the finance receivables sold and our recorded investment in the finance receivables sold 
our investment in finance receivables consisted of the principal balance of the finance receivables securitized net of the allowance for credit losses related to the securitized receivables 
we then reduced our allowance for credit losses by the amount of allowance for credit losses attributable to the loans securitized 
we allocated the recorded investment in the finance receivables between the portion of the finance receivables sold and the portion retained based on the relative fair values on the date of sale 
page gain on sale method under the gain on sale method  the securitized loans are transferred off our balance sheet  a residual interest is recorded reported herein as residual interest in finance receivables sold and a gain on sale of loans is recorded 
subsequent to a sale  traditional financial statement elements generally associated with loan portfolios such as interest income  interest expense  servicing costs and other costs are not recorded on our accounting records  but rather were estimated at the time of sale and recorded as an element of the gain computation 
after september  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we changed the way we structure securitization transactions for accounting purposes to what we refer to as the collateralized borrowing method and accordingly recognize the income and associated costs over the life of the loan 
the change in structure beginning in the fourth quarter of did not affect our prior securitizations 
collateralized borrowing method under the collateralized borrowing method  the securitized loans are retained on our balance sheet  and a note payable known as class a obligations is recorded for the amount loaned to the company by the class a note and certificate holders 
as additional collateral for the borrowers  at closing cash is deposited into a restricted cash reserve account reported herein as investments held in trust 
under this accounting method  our financial statements include interest income  interest expense  servicing costs and the other costs generally associated with loan portfolio accounting and are recognized over the life of the loan 
with this overview and background information  the following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales of used cars and cost of used cars sold annual percentage change in thousands number of used cars sold    sales of used cars    cost of used cars sold    gross margin    gross margin per car sold sales    cost of used cars sold    gross margin    the number of used cars sold units  sales of used cars revenues  and cost of used cars sold increased in both and same store unit sales were comparable for the years ended december   and the growth for these periods reflects increases in the number of dealerships in operation and the average unit sales price 
the gross margin percentage has also increased over the past two years  as we have been successful in increasing our sales prices by more than the increase in the cost of used cars sold 
we anticipate future revenue growth will continue to come from increasing the number of dealerships and not from higher sales volumes at existing dealerships 
the company finances substantially all of its sales 
the following table indicates the percentage of sales units and revenue financed percentage of used cars sold financed percentage of sales revenue financed page provision for credit losses annual percentage change provision for credit losses in thousands    provision per loan originated    provision as of principal balances originated provision for credit losses is the amount we charge to current operations on each car sold to establish an allowance for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses in total  per loan originated and as a percent of principal balances originated increased in both and the increases were due to an increase in the average amount financed to  per unit in the year ended december  from  per unit in the year ended december  and from  per unit in the year ended december  the increase from to was also a result of the change in our securitization structure as discussed in the following paragraph 
when we changed the way we structured securitizations for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of  we also changed the amount we provided for credit losses 
for periods prior to the fourth quarter of  we generally provided a provision for credit losses of approximately of the loan principal balance at the time of origination 
upon securitization  using the gain on sale method  losses for the life of the loans were estimated and recorded as an element of the gain computation 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we increased the provision for credit losses to of the initial amount financed 
net interest income annual percentage change in thousands interest income    portfolio interest expense   net interest income    average effective yield average effective borrowing cost 
interest income for consists primarily of interest on finance receivable principal balances retained on our balance sheet 
retained principal balances grew from million at december  to million at december  primarily as a result of the change in our securitization structure 
interest income in and consists primarily of interest income from residuals in finance receivables sold retained under our securitization structure using the gain on sale method 
residuals in finance receivables sold were million and million at december  and  respectively 
both retained principal balances and residuals in finance receivables sold are components of finance receivables  net 
see growth in finance receivables  net beginning on page interest expense for consists primarily of interest on the revolving facility and the class a obligations issued in our securitization transactions arising from the collateralized borrowings on the retained portfolio 
the increase in interest expense from to is in direct correlation to the increase in retained principal balances noted above 
interest expense in and relates solely to expense on our revolving facility for the period between origination and securtization  which generally averaged three months 
also  as a result of two common stock offerings in late and february  a significant portion of our portfolio was financed with stockholders equity 
page gain on sale of loans we recorded no gains on sale in gains on the sale of loans from securitization transactions were million in and million in the million gain in is net of a million charge arising from higher loan losses than originally estimated at securitization 
servicing income we generate servicing income primarily from servicing loan portfolios securitized under the gain on sale method 
a summary of servicing income follows in thousands annual percentage change servicing income    we service loans for monthly fees ranging from 
to 
of the beginning of month principal balances to per year 
the decrease in servicing income in is due to the decrease in remaining principal balances securitized and serviced under the gain on sale method from million at december  to million at december  the increase in from is due to the increase in such principal balances from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in servicing income is expected to continue as principal balances associated with loans securitized under the gain on sale method continue to decline 
income before operating expenses as a result of our continued expansion  income before operating expenses grew from through annual percentage change income before operating expenses    growth of sales of used cars  net interest income  gain on sale of loans  and servicing and other income were the primary contributors to year over year increases 
operating expenses annual percentage change operating expenses in thousands 
   per car sold    as of total revenues operating expenses  which consist of selling  marketing  general and administrative and depreciation amortization expenses increased in total resulting from overall growth in the operations of the company 
decreases in operating expenses on a per car sold and as a percent of total revenue basis is a result of increased economies of scale related primarily to marketing expenses with the opening of additional dealerships in established markets  efficiencies gained from enhanced management information systems and benefits gained from certain costs which do not rise proportionately to the increase in used cars sold and financed 
see additional discussion of operating expenses in the business segment section beginning on page page interest expense interest expenses arising from our subordinated debt totaled  for the year ended december  interest expense for the years ended december  and  other than interest expense associated with our retained portfolios  was not material to results of operations 
while the company has additional interest expenses arising from subordinated notes payable  substantially all of this interest expense was attributed to the financing of assets and activities reported as discontinued operations 
as the assets and activities of discontinued operations diminish  the company does not expect to retire the subordinated notes payable but rather use these borrowings to fund our growth 
subordinated debt carries interest rates generally higher than those charged on borrowings collateralized by our finance receivables 
accordingly  the company would expect to have a disproportionate increase in interest expense in future periods as existing subordinated debt is used to fund our growth 
income taxes income taxes totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in from resulted from an increase in the number of used cars sold  an increase in gross margin on used cars sold  an increase in net interest income from the growth of our retained portfolio and the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of total revenues 
the increase in over was partially offset by the change in the level of provision for credit losses charged as discussed in the following paragraph 
the decrease in from results primarily from the reduction in gain on sale income discussed below  and to a lesser extent an increase in our provision for credit losses 
in and  the company completed one securitization each quarter 
in  all four quarterly securitizations were completed using the gain on sale method 
in securitization transactions for the first three quarters were completed using the gain on sale method  with the fourth quarter transaction being completed using the collateralized borrowings method  thus recording no gain 
additionally  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the provision for credit losses was increased to of the original amount financed from the level used in the first three quarter of and all of discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits  was  in  a loss of million in  and earnings of million in the significant change from to was due to the charges we recorded totaling million million  net of income taxes to close our branch office network and our terminated cygnet rights offering

business segment information the company reports its operations based on three operating segments 
these segments are reported herein as retail  portfolio and corporate 
these segments were previously reported as company dealership  company dealership receivables and corporate and other  respectively 
operating expenses for our business segments  along with a description of the included activities  for the years ended december   and follows page retail operations 
operating expenses for our retail segment consists of company marketing efforts  maintenance and development of dealership and inspection center sites  and direct management oversight of used car acquisition  reconditioning and sales activities 
a summary of retail operating expenses follows in thousands except per car sold amounts retail operations 
operating expenses for our retail segment consists of company marketing efforts  maintenance and development of dealership and inspection center sites  and direct management oversight of used car acquisition  reconditioning and sales activities 
a summary of retail operating expenses follows in thousands except per car sold amounts annual percentage change selling and marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    per car sold selling and marketing general and administrative  depreciation and amortization as of used cars sold revenue selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization total selling and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue and on a per car sold basis trended downward in both and primarily as a result of having additional dealerships in existing markets 
additional dealerships in a market have increased units sold and revenues while selling and marketing costs remained stable 
this generally equates to costs spread over a larger operating base thus improving both our margins per car sold and percent of revenue operating results 
general and administrative expenses increased year over year as a result of our growth in the number of operating dealerships 
on a per car sold basis  these expenses trended down in primarily as a result of increased volume in each market  thereby allowing certain fixed regional costs to be spread over the increased unit volume 
the increase was primarily the result of opening dealerships in two new markets 
as a percent of used car sales revenue  both and trended downward primarily as a result of an increase in average selling price as well as the efficiencies gained with the opening of additional dealerships in existing markets 
portfolio operations 
operating expenses for our portfolio segment consist of loan servicing and collection efforts  securitization activities  and other operations pertaining directly to the administration and collection of the loan portfolio in thousands except expense per month per loan serviced 
annual percentage change general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    expense per month per loan serviced expense as of average managed portfolio the increase in operating expenses for our portfolio segment year over year is primarily a result of the increasing number of loans in our portfolio 
expenses per loan serviced and as a percent of average managed portfolio page increased from to primarily due to personnel related issues as discussed below 
expenses per loan serviced and as a percent of average managed portfolio decreased from to the decrease is due primarily to the efficiencies associated with our integrated loans servicing system acquired in late and an initiative begun in late that increased the number of loans each collector serviced 
in the last half of  we experienced loan servicing inefficiencies  including the loss of a large number of experienced collectors to other financial services entities 
while we believe we have successfully addressed these issues  loan servicing costs increased significantly in the fourth quarter of as part of our resolution  we made market adjustments to collection staff wages and also decreased the number of delinquent accounts serviced per collector 
while management is confident that these efforts will ultimately translate into decreased loan charge offs  servicing expense on a per loan serviced basis as well as as a percent of the managed portfolio are expected to increase from the levels reported in corporate operations 
operating expenses for our corporate segment consist of costs to provide managerial oversight and reporting for ugly duckling  develop and implement policies and procedures  and provide expertise to ugly duckling in areas such as finance  legal  human resources and information technology 
annual percentage change in thousands general and administrative    depreciation and amortization  per car sold as of total revenues operating expenses related to our corporate segment decreased on both a per car sold basis and as a percent of total revenue primarily as a result of various operating efficiencies 
these efficiencies include those gained by the consolidation of all accounting and management information to a single computer system in early further  as new dealerships opened in existing markets  revenue and units sold increased while expenditures related to infrastructure deployment and support  human resources activities and regulatory compliance increased at a lesser rate 
finally  as our retained portfolio increased  there is a proportionate increase in net interest income thereby significantly improving the ratio of corporate expenses to total revenues

the growth in total assets from to was primarily due to an increase in finance receivables  net and inventory  offset by a decrease in net assets of discontinued operations 
inventory 
inventory represents the acquisition and reconditioning costs of used cars located at our dealerships and our inspection centers 
the increase in inventory in over was primarily due to an increase in dealership and inspection center sites coupled with a decision to increase inventory levels at year end in preparation for the strong seasonal sale period during the first and second quarters of management estimates that for each car it has at a dealership location it must have a car in the reconditioning process at an inspection center to maintain a stable supply of cars for sale 
we generally acquire our used car inventory from three sources  approximately from auctions  from wholesalers and from new car dealerships 
growth in finance receivables  net 
as a result of our expansion  finance receivables  net increased significantly during the past two years

managed loans outstanding december  principal balances number of loans principal managed     less principal securitized and sold     principal retained on balance sheet     the increase in principal balances retained on balance sheet was primarily due to an increase in loans receivable as a result of increased used car sales and financing from growth in the number of dealerships  partially offset by the principal balance runoff of loans originated in prior periods 
our dealership network increased from dealerships at december  to dealerships at december  to dealerships at december  investments held in trust represent funds held by trustees on behalf of our securitization lenders 
the increase in is attributable to securitizations completed under the collaterized borrowing method 
residuals in finance receivables sold represent the company s subordinated interest in loans sold under the gain on sale method 
the decrease in is attributable to no additional loans securitized under the gain on sale method  as well as the runoff of portfolios securitized and sold during prior periods

charge off activity principal balances   recoveries  net   net charge offs   other allowance activity in consists primarily of additions to our allowance recorded in association with loans acquired as part of our two acquisitions 
the reduction in is the amount of allowance transferred off balance sheet as part of loans sold under the gain on sale method in our securitizations 
even though a loan is charged off  we continue with collection efforts on the loan 
recoveries as a percentage of principal balances charged off from dealership operations averaged for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in the recovery percent is attributable to inefficiencies in our loan service operations  as previously mentioned  and an increase in gross margin per car sold which translates into the value of the recovered collateral representing a lesser percent of the loan balance 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level that in management s judgment is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our retail portfolio

see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
total debt 
total debt is comprised of notes payable portfolio  other notes payable and subordinated notes payable 
we financed the increases in our loan portfolio and other assets primarily through additional borrowings  represented by increases in notes payable portfolio 
the significant increase in notes payable portfolio in was primarily due to the change in our securitization structure to the collateralized borrowing method 
the decrease in subordinated notes payable was primarily due to the assumption of the verde subordinated debt by cygnet capital corporation  the purchaser  in connection with the sale of cygnet dealer finance 
other notes payable were increased primarily to finance assets attributed to our discontinued operations

static pool analysis we use a static pool analysis to monitor performance for loans we have originated at our dealerships 
in a static pool analysis  we assign each month s originations to a unique pool and track the charge offs for each pool separately 
we calculate the cumulative net charge offs for each pool as a percentage of that pool s original principal balances  based on the number of complete payments made by the customer before charge off 
the table below displays the cumulative net charge offs of each pool as a percentage of original loan cumulative balances  based on the quarter the loans were originated 
the table is further stratified by the number of payments made by our customers prior to charge off 
for periods denoted by x  the pools have not seasoned sufficiently to allow us to compute cumulative losses 
for periods denoted by page  the pools have not yet reached the indicated cumulative age 
while we monitor static pools on a monthly basis  for presentation purposes we are presenting the information in the table below on a quarterly basis 
currently reported cumulative losses may vary from those previously reported for the reasons listed below  however  management believes that such variation will not be material o ongoing collection efforts on charged off accounts  and o the difference between final proceeds on the sale of repossessed collateral versus our estimates of the sale of proceeds 
the following table sets forth as of february   the cumulative net charge offs as a percentage of original loan cumulative pool balances  based on the quarter of origination and segmented by the number of monthly payments completed by customers before charge off

december  days delinquent retained on balance sheet securitized gain on sale total portfolio in accordance with our charge off policy  no accounts were more than days delinquent as of december  and securitizations under the current legal structure of our securitization program  we sell loans to our subsidiaries that then securitize the loans by transferring them to separate trusts that issue several classes of notes and certificates collateralized by the loans 
the securitization subsidiaries then sell class a notes or certificates class a obligations or notes payable to investors and subordinate classes are retained by us or our subsidiaries 
we continue to service the securitized loans 
the class a obligations have historically received investment grade ratings 
to secure the payment of the class a obligations  the securitization subsidiaries obtain an insurance policy from mbia insurance corporation that guarantees payment of amounts to the holders of the class a obligations 
additionally  we also establish a cash reserve account for the benefit of the class a obligation holders 
the reserve accounts are classified in our consolidated financial statements as investments held in trust and are a component of finance receivables  net 
reserve account requirements 
under our current securitization structure  we make an initial cash deposit into a reserve account  generally equivalent to of the initial underlying finance receivables principal balance and pledge this cash to the reserve account agent 
the trustee then makes additional deposits to the reserve account out of collections on the securitized receivables as necessary to fund the reserve account to a specified percentage  ranging from to  of the underlying finance receivables principal balance 
the trustee makes distributions to us when o the reserve account balance exceeds the specified percentage  o the required periodic payments to the class a certificate holders are current  and o the trustee  servicer and other administrative costs are current 
during  we made initial reserve account deposits totaling approximately million 
the required aggregate reserve account balance  based upon the targeted percentages  was approximately million at december   with balances in the reserve accounts totaling approximately million 
as of december   the amount remaining to be funded out of portfolio collections to meet the required aggregate balance was approximately million 
during the second and third quarters of  we experienced loan servicing inefficiencies that resulted in increased delinquency and charge off levels 
as a result  certain reserve account requirements were increased until delinquency and charge off levels returned to contractually specified percentages 
as of the date of this filing  we have addressed the challenges in the loan servicing area and  consequently  have realized improvements in the delinquency and charge off levels to allow sufficient reserve account formerly spread account requirements to return to their original specified percentages 
additionally  effective with the march collection period  all increases in reserve account requirements will have been eliminated  reducing the reserve account requirement by approximately million 
further  all reserve account balances have reached their specified percentages and the related trusts will distribute cash to the company december securitization 
as a result of the servicing issues discussed above  the december securitization included an additional initial deposit requirement 
assuming continuation of improved current delinquency and charge off levels  the additional deposit will be returned to us at per month during the last two quarters in as of the date of this filing  this trust has reached its specified required deposit level and is distributing cash to the company

we require capital for o increases in our loan portfolio  o common stock repurchases  o expansion of our dealership network  o the purchase of inventories  and o working capital and general corporate purposes  o the purchase of property and equipment 
we fund our capital requirements primarily through o operating cash flow  o our revolving facility with ge capital  and o securitization transactions  o supplemental borrowings 
while to date we have met our liquidity requirements as needed  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in the year ended december  to million from cash provided in the year ended december  of million 
the increase in was due primarily to net earnings  an increase in the provision for credit losses and decreases in activity associated with the elimination of gain on sale recognition of finance receivables  offset by an increase in inventory resulting from management s decision to increase inventory levels at year end in preparation for strong seasonal sales in the first and second quarters of net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in the year ended december  to million from cash used in the year ended december  of million

financing resources revolving facility 
under our million revolving facility  our borrowing base consists of up to of the principal balance of eligible loans originated from the sale of used cars and the lesser of million or of the direct vehicle costs for eligible vehicle inventory 
the revolving facility expires in june and includes a provision for a one year extension upon agreement by both parties 
although there can be no assurance  we expect this agreement to be extended for an additional year 
the revolving facility also contains a provision that requires us to pay ge capital a termination fee of  if we terminate the revolving facility prior to the expiration date 
we secure the facility with substantially all of our assets 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving facility was million  the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the revolving facility was approximately million  and the amount available to be borrowed under the facility was million 
the revolving facility bears interest at the day libor plus  payable daily total rate of as of december  
the revolving facility contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to take certain actions without ge capital s consent  including incur additional indebtedness  make any change in our capital structure  declare or pay dividends  and make certain investments and capital expenditures 
the revolving facility also provides that an event of default will occur if mr 
ernest c 
garcia ii owns less than of our voting stock 
mr 
garcia owned approximately of our common stock at december  in addition  we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios  including a debt excluding subordinated debt to equity ratio of not more than to and a net worth of at least million 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants in this agreement 
securitizations 
our securitization program is a primary source of our working capital 
securitizations generate cash flow for us from the sale of class a obligations  ongoing servicing fees  and excess cash flow distributions from collections on the loans securitized after payments on the class a obligations  payment of fees  expenses  and insurance premiums  and required deposits to the reserve account 
securitization also allows us to fix our cost of funds for a given loan portfolio 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securitizations for a more complete description of our securitization program 
supplemental borrowings senior subordinated notes 
in february  we borrowed a total of million of subordinated debt from unrelated third parties for a three year term 
we pay interest on this debt quarterly at per annum 
we issued warrants to the lenders of this debt to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable at any time until the later of february  or when the debt is paid in full 
this debt is senior to the subordinated debentures issued in our exchange offers described below  subordinate to our other indebtedness  and had a million balance at december  in may  we borrowed approximately million from an unrelated party for a term of two years maturing on may  residual loan 
the note calls for monthly principal payments of generally not less than  through may and not less than million thereafter  plus interest at a rate equal to libor plus basis points 
the loan is secured by our residuals in finance receivables sold and certain finance receivables and the loan balance was million at december  page sale leaseback of real property 
in march  we executed an agreement with an unrelated investment company for the sale and leaseback of up to million in real property

we pay monthly rents of approximately one twelfth of of the purchase price plus all occupancy costs and taxes 
the agreement calls for annual increases in monthly rent to of the purchase price in and thereafter in accordance with increases in the consumer price index 
as of december   we had sold properties for a total price of approximately million under this arrangement 
for the reason discussed in the following paragraph  we do not anticipate closing any additional transactions under this agreement 
we used substantially all of the proceeds from the sales to pay down debt 
in december  verde acquired at a discount  all sale leaseback properties sold to the unrelated investment company in we acquired the option to purchase these properties at verde s purchase price at anytime through december  under the terms of the sale of cygnet dealer to an affiliate of mr 
garcia in december  the term of the option was extended and the new option expires simultaneously with our receipt of payment in full of the million note receivable arising from the sale of cygnet dealer or december   whichever comes later 
exchange offer 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired approximately million shares of our common stock in exchange for approximately million of subordinated debentures 
we issued the debentures at a premium of approximately million over the market value of the shares of our common stock that were exchanged for the debentures 
accordingly  the debt was recorded at million on our balance sheet 
the premium will be amortized over the life of the debentures and results in an effective annual interest rate of approximately

capital expenditures and commitments as a result of an aggressive growth strategy  during the year ended december  we opened new dealerships 
we also have six more dealerships under development 
the magnitude of the direct cost of opening a dealership is primarily a function of whether we lease a facility or construct a facility 
a leased facility costs approximately  to develop  while a facility we construct costs approximately million 
in addition  we require capital to finance the portfolio that we carry on our balance sheet for each dealership 
it takes approximately million in cash to support a typical stabilized dealership portfolio with our existing advance rate under our ge facility 
additionally  it takes approximately months for a dealership portfolio to reach a stabilized level 
page we intend to finance the construction of new dealerships through operating cash flows and supplemental borrowings  including amounts available under the revolving facility and the securitization program 
common stock repurchase program 
in october  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program  allowing us to purchase up to one million shares of our common stock from time to time 
purchases may be made depending on market conditions  share price and other factors 
our board of directors extended the stock repurchase program in february  to december  during and  we repurchased  and  shares  respectively  of common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
since january   we have repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program and the exchange offer described above at an average cost of approximately per share 
in september  our board of directors approved a director and senior officer stock purchase loan program 
we may make loans of up to million in total to the directors and senior officers under the program to assist directors and officers purchases of common stock on the open market 
these unsecured loans bear interest at per year 
during  senior officers purchased  shares of common stock under this program and we loaned  to the senior officers for these purchases 
during  we made additional loans under similar terms and conditions to senior officers totaling approximately  for the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
during  no loans under this program were made to senior officers 
inflation increases in inflation generally result in higher interest rates 
higher interest rates on our borrowings would decrease the profitability of our existing portfolio 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
we seek to limit this risk o through our securitization program  which allows us to fix our borrowing costs  o by increasing the interest rate charged for loans originated at our dealerships if allowed under applicable law  or o by increasing the profit margin on the cars sold 
year disclosures many older computer programs refer to years only in terms of their final two digits 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
the problem affects not only computer software  but also computer hardware and other systems containing processors and embedded chips 
business systems affected by this problem may not be able to accurately process date related information before  during or after january  this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
failure of our own business systems due to year issues as well as those of our suppliers and business partners could materially adversely affect our business 
we have spent approximately million to date preparing and analyzing year issues 
with some minor exceptions which have been addressed  we were unaffected by the change from the year to the year we do not anticipate significant problems or material expenditures in the future related to the year issues 
as of the date of this report  we have not been affected by any year problems of our suppliers or business partners  but such problems could arise in the future 
we will attempt to minimize the impact of other parties failure to resolve year problems 
accounting matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the adoption of sfas no 
was delayed by the issuance of sfas the statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes new accounting rules for hedging instruments 
in june  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year until fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on us 
page risk factors there are various risks in purchasing our securities and investing in our business  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all other information included in this form k 
we make forward looking statements 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of revenues  income  or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made 
they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which we cannot predict or quantify 
future events and actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements 
when considering each forward looking statement  you should keep in mind the risk factors and cautionary statements found throughout this form k and specifically those found below 
we are not obligated to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or for any other reason 
future losses could impair our ability to raise capital or borrow money and consequently affect our stock price 
although we recorded earnings from continuing operations of million for the twelve months ended december  and million in  we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in future periods 
losses in future periods could impair our ability to raise additional capital or borrow money as needed  and could decrease our stock price 
we may not be able to obtain the financing we need to fund our operations and  as a result  our profitability could be reduced 
our operations require large amounts of capital 
we have borrowed  and will continue to borrow  substantial amounts to fund our operations 
if we cannot obtain the financing we need on a timely basis and on favorable terms  our business and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
we currently obtain our financing through three primary sources a revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation  securitization transactions  and loans from other sources 
revolving credit facility with ge capital 
our revolving facility with ge capital is our primary source of operating capital 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to ge capital to secure the borrowings we make under this facility 
although this facility has a maximum commitment of million  the amount we can borrow is limited by the amount of certain types of assets that we own 
when we have used all our capacity under the revolving facility  our liquidity can be adversely affected unless we can find alternative financing sources 
the revolving facility expires in june and  even if we continue to satisfy the terms and conditions of the revolving facility  we may not be able to extend its term beyond the current expiration date 
if we cannot extend the term of the revolving facility or replace that facility with a substitute facility  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
securitization transactions we can restore capacity under the ge facility from time to time by securitizing portfolios of finance receivables 
our ability to successfully complete securitizations and how favorable the terms of our securitizations will be to us may be affected by several factors  including o the condition of securities markets generally  o conditions in the asset backed securities markets specifically  o the credit quality of our loan portfolio  and o the performance of our servicing operations 
contractual restrictions the revolving facility  the securitization program  and our other credit facilities contain various restrictive covenants 
page under these credit facilities  we must also meet certain financial tests 
failure to satisfy the covenants in our credit facilities or our securitization program could preclude us from further borrowing under the defaulted facility  could cause cross defaults to our other debt  and could prevent us from securing alternate sources of funds necessary to operate our business 
recent waivers 
from time to time  we incur technical or other breaches under our material credit facilities  and we have obtained waivers from the applicable lenders 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive waivers and our inability to obtain these waivers may have a material impact our ability to obtain or retain operating capital 
we have a high risk of credit losses because of the poor creditworthiness of our borrowers 
substantially all of the sales financing that we extend and the loans that we service are with sub prime borrowers 
sub prime borrowers generally cannot borrow money from traditional lending institutions  such as banks  savings and loans  credit unions  and captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers  because of their poor credit histories and or low incomes 
loans to sub prime borrowers are difficult to collect and are subject to a high risk of loss 
we have established an allowance for credit losses to cover our anticipated credit losses 
however  our allowance may not be sufficient to cover our credit losses 
a significant variation in the timing of or increase in credit losses in our portfolio would have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
interest rates affect our profitability 
much of our financing income results from the difference between the rate of interest that we pay on the funds we borrow and the rate of interest that we earn on the loans in our portfolio 
while we earn interest on the loans that we own at a fixed rate  we pay interest on our borrowings under our revolving facility at a floating rate 
when interest rates increase  our interest expense increases and our net interest margins decrease 
increases in our interest expense that we cannot offset by increases in interest income will lower our profitability 
laws that limit the interest rates that we can charge can adversely affect our profitability 
we operate in many states that impose limits on the interest rate that a lender may charge 
when a state limits the amount of interest that we can charge on our installment sales loans  we may not be able to offset any increased interest expense caused by rising interest rates or greater levels of borrowings under our credit facilities 
therefore  these interest rate limitations can adversely affect our profitability 
government regulation may limit our ability to recover and enforce receivables or to repossess and sell collateral 
we are subject to ongoing regulation  supervision  and licensing under various federal  state  and local statutes  ordinances  and regulations 
if we do not comply with these laws  we could be fined or certain of our operations could be interrupted or shut down 
failure to comply could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
among other things  these laws o require that we obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications  o limit or prescribe terms of the loans that we originate and or purchase  o require specified disclosures to customers  o limit our right to repossess and sell collateral  and o prohibit us from discriminating against certain customers 
we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable material federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
we may not  however  be able to remain in compliance with such laws 
in addition  the adoption of additional statutes and regulations  changes in the interpretation of existing statutes and regulations  or our entry into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could also have a material adverse effect on our operations 
page we are subject to pending actions and investigations relating to our compliance with various laws and regulations 
while we do not believe that ultimate resolution of these matters will result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition such as fines  injunctions or damages  there can be no assurance in this regard 
events happening to other companies in our industry can adversely affect our operations and the value of our securities 
in recent years  several major used car finance companies have announced major downward adjustments to their financial statements  violations of loan covenants  related litigation  and other events 
companies in the used vehicle sales and financing market have also been named as defendants in an increasing number of class action lawsuits brought by customers claiming violations of various federal and state consumer credit and similar laws and regulations 
in addition  some of these companies have filed for bankruptcy protection 
these events o have lowered the value of securities of sub prime automobile finance companies  o have made it more difficult for sub prime lenders to borrow money  and o could cause more restrictive regulation of this industry 
if our current contingency plan is inadequate  we could have a system failure  which could adversely affect our ability to collect on loans  and comply with statutory requirements 
we depend on our loan servicing and collection facilities and on long distance and local telecommunications access to transmit and process information among our various facilities 
we use a standard program to prepare and store off site backup tapes of our main system applications and data files on a routine basis 
we regularly revise our contingency plan  however  the plan as revised may not prevent a systems failure or allow us to timely resolve any systems failures 
also  a natural disaster  calamity  or other significant event that causes long term damage to any of these facilities or that interrupts our telecommunications networks could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have continuing risks relating to the first merchants transaction 
we have entered into several transactions in the bankruptcy proceedings of first merchants acceptance corporation 
we have the right to of recoveries on first merchants residual interests in certain securitized loan pools and other loans 
however  if we lose our right to service these loans  our share of these residual interests can be reduced or eliminated 
this could affect our future cash flow and profitability 
in addition  if we meet certain conditions  we have the right to issue our common stock to first merchants or its unsecured creditors or equity holders in exchange for a portion of first merchants share of collections on the residual interests 
however  we must estimate anticipated collections in advance to determine the amount of stock to issue  and if our estimates are not accurate we could issue too many shares of our common stock and dilute our shareholders 
we may make acquisitions that are unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources from more profitable operations 
in  we completed two acquisitions 
we intend to consider additional acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counterparties 
also  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
we may also not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions  our operating expenses may increase 
this increase would affect our net earnings  which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
these transactions involve numerous other risks as well  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
page increased competition could adversely affect our operations and profitability 
our primary competitors are the numerous small buy here pay here used car dealers that operate in the sub prime segment of the used car sales industry 
we attempt to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through name recognition and other factors 
however the advertising and infrastructure required by these efforts increase our operating expenses 
there is no assurance that we can successfully distinguish ourselves and compete in this industry 
in addition  in recent years  a number of larger companies with significant financial and other resources  have entered or announced plans to enter the used car sales industry 
although these companies do not currently compete with us in the sub prime segment of the market  they compete with us in the purchase of inventory  which can result in increased wholesale costs for used cars and lower margins 
they could also enter the sub prime segment of the market at any time 
increased competition may cause downward pressure on the interest rates that we charge on loans originated by our dealerships 
either change could have a material effect on the value of our securities 
the success of our operations depends on certain key personnel 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to operate profitably depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our key management personnel or our inability to attract new management when necessary could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any member of our senior management team other than gregory b 
sullivan  our president and chief executive officer 
we may issue stock in the future that will dilute the value of our existing stock 
we have the ability to issue common stock or securities exercisable for or convertible into common stock  which may dilute the securities our existing stockholders now hold 
in particular  issuance of any or all of the following securities may dilute the value of the securities that our existing stockholders now hold o we have granted warrants to purchase a total of approximately million shares of our common stock to various parties  with exercise prices ranging from to per share  o we may issue additional warrants in connection with future transactions  o we may issue common stock under our various stock option plans  and o we may issue common stock in the first merchants transaction in exchange for an increased share of collections on certain loans that we service for first merchants 
we also currently intend on asking for our shareholders approval at our annual meeting  currently scheduled for may   of a proposal authorizing the creation of blank check common stock 
if passed  this would allow our board of directors to establish a series of common stock on terms to be determined by the board of directors 
depending upon the terms of the stock and of the market s reaction  existing shareholders could be adversely affected or it could have a potential anti takeover or dilutive effect 
the voting power of our principal stockholder may limit your voting rights 
mr 
ernest c 
garcia  ii  our chairman  or his affiliates held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  mr 
garcia has a significant influence upon our activities as well as on all matters requiring approval of our stockholders 
these matters include electing or removing members of our board of directors  engaging in transactions with affiliated entities  causing or restricting our sale or merger  and changing our dividend policy 
the interests of mr 
garcia may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
there is a potential anti takeover or dilutive effect if we issue preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue blank check preferred stock 
our board of directors may fix or change from time to time the designation  number  voting powers  preferences  and rights of this stock 
such page issuance s could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us by reducing the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
preferred stock can also reduce the market value of the common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk on our financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
our earnings are substantially affected by our net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
increases in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on profitability 
our financial instruments consist primarily of fixed rate finance receivables  residual interests in pools of fixed rate finance receivables  short term variable rate revolving notes receivable  and variable and fixed rate notes payable 
our finance receivables are classified as subprime loans and generally bear interest at the lower of or the maximum interest rate allowed in states that impose interest rate limits 
at december   the scheduled maturities on our finance receivables ranged from one to months  with a weighted average maturity of months 
the interest rates we charge our customers on finance receivables has not changed as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates  although we may increase the interest rates we charge in the future if market interest rates increase 
a large component of our debt at december  is the collateralized note payable class a obligations issued under our securitization program 
issuing debt through our securitization program allows us to mitigate our interest rate risk by reducing the balance of the variable revolving line of credit and replacing it with a lower fixed rate note payable 
we are subject to interest rate risk on fixed rate notes payable to the extent that future interest rates are higher than the interest rates on our existing notes payable 
the table below illustrates the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our earnings before income taxes over a twelve month period 
we compute the impact on earnings for the period by first computing the baseline net interest income on our financial instruments with interest rate risk  which are the variable rate revolving credit lines and the variable rate notes payable 
we then determine the net interest income based on each of the interest rate changes listed below and compare the results to the baseline net interest income to determine the estimated change in pretax earnings 
the table does not give effect to our fixed rate receivables and borrowings 
change in interest rates change in pretax earnings in thousands in computing the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates  we have assumed that o interest rates used for the baseline and hypothetical net interest income amounts are in effect for the entire twelve month period  o interest for the period is calculated on financial instruments held at december  less contractually scheduled payments and maturities  and o there is no change in prepayment rates as a result of the interest rate changes 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes could be significantly different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to compute the estimates
