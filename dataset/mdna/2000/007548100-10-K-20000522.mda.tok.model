item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of atp and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
tpg was formed in to acquire the brunswick business  which acquisition was completed on april  the selected consolidated financial data for presents the four month period prior to the acquisition of the brunswick business and the eight month period subsequent to such acquisition 
on october   tpg merged with lunn under the name advanced technical products  inc immediately after the merger  the former stockholders of lunn owned approximately of atp and the former stockholders of tpg owned approximately of atp 
for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as a purchase of lunn by tpg and the results of operations of lunn since november  have been included in the consolidated financial statements of atp 
on may   atp acquired all of the capital stock of brigantine sa  a manufacturer of honeycomb products and engineered panels located in france 
the acquired company  renamed alcore brigantine sa  operates as a subsidiary of alcore  inc  a division of the company 
the acquisition has expanded the company s access to the european aerospace and commercial markets 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the operating results for alcore brigantine sa since the date of the acquisition 
historically  approximately to of atp s products and services have been sold to the united states government through prime contracts directly with governmental agencies  primarily the dod  or through subcontracts with other governmental contractors 
during the mid s  the defense industry began to be negatively impacted by a perceived reduction of threats from the former soviet union and affiliated countries in eastern europe 
in addition  increased competition for the united states federal budget dollars resulted in a reduction in real dollars in the united states defense budget over the last decade 
defense spending has recently begun to stabilize in the united states  and management of atp believes that budgeted procurement spending will increase slightly over the next few years 
the contraction of the united states defense budget over the last decade and the resulting excess capacity and intensified competition among defense contractors has resulted in significant industry consolidation 
atp s strategy includes the pursuit of acquisitions which will increase its revenue base and improve its cost competitiveness through reduced overhead costs  facility consolidations and the elimination of other duplicative costs 
management is evaluating the possibility of additional acquisitions in the event the pending transaction with veritas is not consummated 
however  because of the uncertainty of the nature and size of these opportunities  as well as atp s financial leverage  there can be no assurances that the financing necessary to pay for acquisitions can be obtained 
although the long term impact of industry consolidation and the defense spending budget cannot be predicted with certainty  management of atp believes that it is positioned to increase its presence in the united states defense industry and increase its ongoing diversification efforts into foreign defense markets and selected commercial markets 
the united states government s fiscal year begins on october  and contracts and options on contracts are generally awarded just prior to its year end 
the lead time to perform the necessary design work  procure material and begin production is generally several months  and this can create a period of low production  revenue and profits in the first half of each fiscal year of atp 
over the last five years  the percentage of sales and operating earnings excluding corporate general and administrative expenses generated in the second half of the year have been as follows earnings before year sales interest taxes not applicable as restated not applicable because the company had an operating loss for see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company for further discussion 
restatement of previously reported financial statements during january  the company learned of possible accounting and financial reporting irregularities at its subsidiary  alcore  when certain financial records were seized in connection with a search warrant issued by the united states district court district of maryland as part of a governmental investigation 
after becoming aware of the possible irregularities  the company engaged special counsel  and through such counsel  such other advisors as deemed necessary to assist in its investigation of the possible irregularities 
as a result of its investigation  the company has determined to restate its consolidated financial statements including its quarterly financial statements for each of the quarters of  as well as for each of the first  second  and third quarters of the following discussion of amounts relates to the company s results of operations as restated for the adjustments determined necessary by the company s investigation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the effects of the adjustments to the and quarterly consolidated financial data unaudited are summarized as follows by quarter earnings loss per revenues operating income loss net income loss common share diluted as as as as previously previously previously previously reported restated reported restated reported restated reported restated first      second      third     fourth    total year

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
as restated revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues increased million  or from million in to million in the increase in revenues in was primarily attributable to the following factors i increased revenues on chemical defense contracts  including two large contracts which were in the design or start up phase during most of and have been in full production during all of  ii increased deliveries of composite components on several long term aerospace defense programs  including the c and f e f military aircraft and iii increased shipments of the company s commercial products  including specialty vehicle electronics and ngv fuel tanks 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in structural core materials shipments primarily caused by reduced material requirements of customers in the commercial aerospace market  and a decrease in shipments on shelter contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to for the comparable period in the decrease is primarily attributable to the losses incurred by alcore during  which totaled million at the gross profit level 
alcore s losses were primarily the result of i production inefficiencies experienced in the moving of certain operations to a new leased facility  including abnormally high production scrap rates and increased costs for machinery and equipment re arrangement and set up  ii lower sales prices caused by intensified competition in the commercial aerospace industry and iii a write off of excess and obsolete inventories and capital equipment 
excluding alcore  gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  substantially the same compared to general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase reflects i higher alcore expenses  including increased costs relating to the facility move  ii higher corporate expense primarily resulting from nonrecurring costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger with veritas  and iii a general increase in business activity 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in excluding alcore for both years  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in operating loss was million in  compared to operating income of million in the decrease is primarily attributed to the alcore operating loss incurred in  which totaled million 
excluding alcore  operating income was million in during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded charges totaling approximately million to write down certain equipment and tooling costs at alcore  reserve for certain inventories that are believed to be no longer recoverable and to accrue for the costs of a lease obligation of alcore 
interest expense in increased  primarily the result of an increase in average loan balances outstanding and an increase in average interest rates during compared to income tax benefit was million in compared to income tax expense of million in the effective income tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective rate in reflects a reserve for the state income tax effect for all of the net deferred tax assets generated by the alcore operating losses in year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues increased million  or from million in to million in positive revenue variations in compared to include i increased revenues of million for lunn and alcore operations  which were included for the full year in compared to only the post merger period two months included in the results reported  ii increased shipments of ngv fuel tanks and related products  iii increased sales on new aerospace defense programs  including new c and chemical defense contracts  and iv increased shipments on shelter contracts 
these increases were partially offset by reduced ordnance product sales resulting from the substantial completion of a major ordnance delivery system contract in early gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to an unfavorable product sales mix in compared to resulting from a full year of lunn and alcore operations in at lower profit rates  particularly at alcore  relative to tpg operations 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase again reflects the inclusion of lunn operations for a full year in compared to two months in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from in to in operating income was million  or of sales  in  compared to million  or of sales  in the increase in operating income reflects the increase in revenues and gross profit  partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses 
interest expense in increased million  or  primarily because of an increase in average loan balances as a result of i debt assumed from lunn in the merger and ii higher working capital and capital expenditures driven by increasing revenue volume anticipated in income taxes decreased million  reflecting lower pre tax earnings as the effective tax rate was for both years 
financial condition and liquidity cash flow provided by operations was million in compared to million in working capital  excluding short term debt balances  decreased million in to million 
this decrease was the result of i a decrease of million in accounts receivable  resulting primarily from lower sales in the last two months of compared to and an increased emphasis on customer collections in  ii an increase of million in inventory  reflecting a continued build up on a few major aerospace composites programs which are in the start up or early production phases  iii an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially the result of increased inventory levels and an increase in accrued employee compensation and benefits at divisions other than alcore  iv an increase in prepaid income taxes of million resulting from tax overpayments made during before it was determined that alcore was incurring operating losses which would significantly reduce the amount of the company s income tax liability for and v a net decrease in other working capital components of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  and resulted exclusively from capital expenditures 
the company s primary loan agreement  as amended on may   includes a total credit facility of million consisting of i million of revolving credit against eligible receivable and inventory balances  ii a million term loan and iii a million capital expenditure facility 
the term loan is payable quarterly based on a seven year amortization period 
the interest rates on the loans are set quarterly based on the company s performance against debt to earnings ratios specified in the agreement 
interest rates can range from libor the london interbank offered rates plus to libor plus on the revolving loan and from libor plus to libor plus on the term and equipment loans 
alternatively  the company may elect interest rates based on the lending institution s prime rate with the revolving loan ranging from prime plus to prime plus and the term and equipment loans ranging from prime plus to prime plus 
interest is paid monthly in arrears on all loans 
the credit facility matures on december  as of december   the company had approximately million of unused borrowing availability on this credit facility 
the company is subject to several financial and nonfinancial covenants under the million credit facility 
at december   the company was in violation of certain financial covenants 
such violations were cured as a result of an amendment to the agreement dated may  as discussed above  the company has made capital expenditures totaling million during  which have been financed by a combination of cash flows from operations and increased borrowings under the revolving  term and equipment loan portions of the company s credit facility 
at december   the company s backlog of orders and long term contracts was approximately million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the backlog includes firm released orders of approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the decrease in firm released orders at the end of compared to and is primarily the result of a decrease in firm orders at alcore and the timing of order releases on contract options 
approximately of the company s firm released backlog at december  is expected to be delivered in atp announced on september  that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement the september merger agreement with two affiliates of the veritas capital fund  lp veritas to sell the company 
due to certain developments which occurred at the company since october   the parties mutually agreed to terminate the september merger agreement without liability to any of the parties 
on january   atp entered into a new merger agreement with veritas pursuant to which  if such january merger agreement was approved by the company s shareholders and consummated  the shareholders of the company would receive per share in cash  without interest 
see item submission of matters to a vote of security holders 
management of atp believes that cash flows from operations and the million credit facility are adequate to sustain atp s current operating level 
however  should circumstances arise affecting cash flow or requiring capital expenditures beyond those anticipated by the company  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
some of such risks and uncertainties are described below 
dependence on principal industries 
the revenues of atp are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industries 
sales to non aerospace and non defense industries  although growing  are anticipated to approximate to of total revenues of atp for the foreseeable future 
atp s success will be heavily dependent on its ability to successfully obtain major new defense orders currently planned to be released by the united states government and government prime contractors  as well as the continued strength of the aerospace industry  particularly the commercial aircraft industry 
no assurances can be given that atp will be able to successfully obtain all or even a major portion of the targeted defense industry orders anticipated to be placed 
the commercial aerospace industry is a cyclical business  and the demand by commercial airlines for new aircraft is highly dependent upon a variety of factors  which historically have been related to the stability and health of the united states and world economies 
risks of reductions or changes in military expenditures 
the primary customers of atp are agencies of the dod 
sales under contracts with the dod or under subcontracts that identify the dod as the ultimate purchaser represented approximately of atp s revenues 
the united states defense budget has declined in real terms since the mid s  resulting in some delays in new program starts  program stretch outs and program cancellations 
the united states defense budget has begun to stabilize and even increase in real dollars over the last several years 
a major portion of atp s dod business is expected to be funded by the procurement and research  development  test and evaluation segments of the defense budget 
procurement and research  development  test and evaluation funding has been significantly reduced over the last decade but is expected to remain relatively stable or grow slightly over the next decade 
a significant portion of atp s dod business is also expected to be funded by the operations and maintenance portion of the dod budget  which has declined less than the other segments 
a further significant decline or reallocation of the procurement  research  development  test and evaluation or operations and maintenance segments of the dod budget could materially and adversely affect atp s sales and earnings 
the loss or significant curtailment of atp s material united states defense contracts would also materially and adversely affect atp s future sales and earnings 
competition 
the market for atp s products is highly competitive 
atp competes with numerous competitors  a number of which possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources 
continued consolidation of major aerospace companies could result in program cancellations as well as increased demand for price concessions 
this  together with increased competition for available business  could translate into downward pressure on gross margins with resulting lower overall profit margins 
vendor prices for production materials such as resins  liquid and film adhesives  reinforcing fiber materials and other materials and supplies could increase as demand for aircraft parts and assemblies increase to match higher build rates for commercial aircraft 
higher material prices and demand for lower aircraft part and assembly prices could place increasing pressure on atp s operating margins and net income 
although management of atp believes that the company is well positioned to maintain or improve its place among its competitors  there can be no assurance that atp will be able to compete successfully in the future 
financial leverage 
atp has a significant amount of indebtedness  which could make it difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes 
moreover  the terms of atp s indebtedness impose various restrictions and covenants on atp which could potentially limit atp s ability to respond to market conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities 
atp s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce total debt will be dependent upon its future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general conditions in the aerospace and defense industries and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of atp  many of which will be beyond its control 
year issues atp completed its year yk preparation plan which included the following steps assessment  modification implementation and testing 
the company has not experienced any significant malfunctions or errors in its internal information technology it and non it systems that are critical to its operations since january  a few minor application problems were identified and resolved early in the year the company is not aware of any significant yk issues or problems that may have arisen for its significant customers and suppliers 
based on currently available information  the company is not aware of any significant continued exposure to yk systems issues 
atp s yk costs have not been budgeted and tracked as independent projects  but have been incurred in conjunction with normal sustaining activities 
atp estimates that such costs  including the replacement or upgrading of outdated  noncompliant hardware and software were less than  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
among other things  eitf issue no 
provides additional guidance on how entities should account for costs incurred to design and develop molds  dies  and tooling that will be used to produce products that will be sold under long term supply arrangements 
the company does not anticipate any material impact on the results of operations upon adopting the provisions of eitf issue no 
 which becomes effective for design and development costs incurred after december  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which clarifies certain conditions to be met in order to recognize revenue 
the company does not anticipate any material impact on the results of operations as a result of this staff accounting bulletin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily relating to its million credit facility 
however  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility generally approximate fair value due to the variable rate nature of such borrowings 
the interest rates are set quarterly based on the company s performance against debt to earnings ratios specified in the agreement 
interest rates can range from libor plus to libor plus on the revolving loan and from libor plus to libor plus on the term and equipment loans 
alternatively  the company may elect interest rates based on the lending institution s prime rate with the revolving loan ranging from prime plus to prime plus and the term and equipment loans ranging from prime plus to prime plus 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of the company has not entered into transactions which subject it to material foreign currency transaction gains and losses
