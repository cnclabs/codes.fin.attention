item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and market electronic components and systems based on superconductors for applications in the worldwide telecommunications markets 
as of december   we had accumulated losses of approximately  and we expect to incur significant additional losses during we  alone or with collaborative partners  must successfully develop  manufacture  introduce and market our potential products in order to achieve profitability 
we do not expect to recognize meaningful product sales until we successfully develop and commercialize superconductive components  systems and subsystems that address significant market needs 
results of operations years ended december    and our total revenues increased to  in from  in after decreasing from  in revenue under us government research and development contracts represented approximately  and of total revenue in  and  respectively 
contract revenue decreased to  in from  in and from  in the decreases in contract revenue relate primarily to the narrowing scope of our business interests in  and during this time  we began to focus exclusively on contracts relating to our wireless telecommunications business and did not continue to seek additional contracts related to superconducting technologies outside of the wireless telecommunications market 
we have submitted several proposals related to prospective contracts associated with our core wireless business and we will continue to submit proposals as additional programs become available 
we believe we will be able to participate in several of the contracts for which proposals have been submitted and anticipate that government contract revenues will increase compared to  however we cannot assure you that we will receive the level of awards we anticipate 
additionally  the recognition of revenue and receipt of payment pursuant to these contracts and awards are subject to numerous risks 
revenue from product sales represented approximately in  in and in product revenue decreased to  in from  in and  in the decreases in product revenue relate primarily to a decrease in revenue from products that do not relate to our core market  including sales of magnetic sensing systems  and other products partially offset by an increase in revenue from sales of our wireless telecommunications products 
we recognized revenue on our wireless telecommunications products of   and  in  and  respectively 
future sales of these products are subject to numerous technical and market risks 
on may   we entered into a definitive agreement with general dynamics information systems  inc gdis to license our high temperature superconductive hts electronics and cryoelectronics technology 
under the license agreement  gdis acquired rights to conductus hts thin film technology and other intellectual property for  plus future royalties and will have rights to use and sell this technology for use in us government or state  local and foreign government markets  as defined under the agreement 
upon execution of the agreement  gdis made an immediate payment to the company of  in addition  gdis began paying the company  on the first day of each month for months beginning on july  conductus and gdis also entered into a cross license  supply and training agreement under which conductus and gdis agreed to cross license updates  if any  to the licensed technology developed by either party 
additionally  the company agreed to provide product and training to gdis in exchange for payment at standard commercial rates from gdis 
as a result of this transaction  conductus recognized revenues of  for the year ended december  cost of product sales were   and  for  and  respectively 
the cost of products were primarily composed of costs of superconducting magnetic systems manufactured by our instrument and systems division  which we disposed of in the cost of products in and were primarily composed of costs of the wireless telecommunications products 
cost of product sales increased in compared to despite the lower volume of sales primarily as a result of the increased overhead and start up costs associated with our wireless communications products 
cost of product sales decreased in compared to and due to lower direct costs 
gross margins on product sales were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins from to was primarily due to the start up costs of wireless communications product lines in late the gross margin decrease resulted from lower revenue partially offset by lower direct cost of product 
the costs of the business are primarily fixed costs  therefore  gross margins are adversely impacted by lower product revenue 
we anticipate gross margins to increase as shipments of the wireless communication products increase  however we cannot assure you that margins will improve in the future 
costs of contract revenues are included in research and development expenses and are discussed below 
research and development includes both externally and internally funded projects 
research and development expenses were   and  and represented  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
the decreases from to are primarily related to the impact of decreases in contract revenues during the comparison periods 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increased spending on new wireless communication and development activities 
research and development expenses include approximately   and  in  and  respectively  attributable to contracts with agencies of the united states government 
these decreases reflect the narrower scope of our business interests 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses on internally funded programs as we seek to develop additional commercial products  particularly in the wireless communications area and  as a result  anticipate moderate increases in research and development expenses compared to selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with marketing  sales  and various administrative activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in spending in compared to was related to decreases in spending in administration compared to the prior year resulting from lower overall headcount levels 
the increase compared to was primarily the result of increases in the sales and marketing department 
we expect to continue to incur increasing sales and marketing expenses to the extent we increase sales of commercial products  particularly in the communications markets 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily due to lower average cash balances during the comparison periods 
interest charges related primarily to our loan from a leasing company as well as our bank term loans 
interest expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily the result of higher average debt levels during the comparison periods 
interest expense in includes interest payments on the bridge loan facility we entered into with our bank  payments related to the outstanding loan from a leasing company and the amortization of the value of warrants issued to the bank and leasing companies 
the reduction of interest payments in compared to was due to the repayment of term loans and reduced borrowing against our line of credit 
as a result of incurring losses  we have not incurred any income tax liability 
we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and review this allowance on a periodic basis 
at such time that we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through  in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in august   in net proceeds from our follow on public offering of common stock in june   raised in private placement financings  including net proceeds of  raised in december and  in january   from us government contracts   in outstanding borrowings under various lease and bank loan arrangements  and  in interest income 
in december  we issued a total of  shares of series c preferred stock convertible into  shares of common stock  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  for a total of  in january  we issued  shares of common stock for  we allocated the net proceeds of  after issuance costs of  from the sale of the series c preferred stock  based on their relative fair value 
accordingly we allocated  to preferred stock   to warrants and  to the beneficial conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion feature is amortized over six months  which is the minimum beneficial conversion period 
hence we expect to record as a deemed dividend an expense of  and  in the quarters ended march  and june   respectively 
as of december   our aggregate cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  compared to  as of december  additionally  we have entered into a bank line of credit facility and an equipment lease line 
we may borrow up to a maximum of  under the bank line of credit based on a limitation of of certain eligible receivables 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the bank line of credit facility 
net cash used in operations was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to a comparatively smaller decrease in accounts receivable compared to the prior period as well as a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by an increase in inventory during the comparison periods 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in related contract and product revenues from and and  to a lesser extent  the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from to the movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily due to a fluctuation in the proportion of accounts greater than days old relative to the total outstanding balance in compared to in   was credited to the statement of operations as this reserve amount was no longer considered necessary based on the level of aged accounts receivable as of december  the increase in the level of inventory from to was primarily due to an increase in the level of wireless communications products during the year required to satisfy ongoing and anticipated trials and shipments of our latest products partially offset by an increase in the allowance for obsolete inventory related to discontinued products  and early versions of wireless communications products 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was the result of a decrease in our operating loss primarily due to the general dynamics license agreement fees 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional net losses during and anticipate that our accounts receivable and inventories may increase during as a result of increased working capital requirements to support wireless telecommunications products 
as a result  we anticipate the use of additional cash in operating activities during net cash provided by used in investing activities was  in  compared to  in and  in the year to year changes  during the comparison period of to and to was primarily due to relatively higher purchases of short term investments than proceeds received on maturities of short term investments 
in  we purchased  more of short term investments than we sold while in we purchased  more of short term investments than we sold with a corresponding decrease in cash in both years 
in addition  capital expenditures decreased by  in compared to and  in compared to due to lower spending on laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
in we paid licensing fees that reduced cash by an additional  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will increase slightly in as we continue our transition to manufacture greater volumes of commercial products 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in compared to  in and  in the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the issuance of preferred series b stock and related warrants as well as proceeds from borrowings in excess of debt payments during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred series c stock and related warrants partially offset by principal payments on long term debt of  all of our credit arrangements contain reporting and financial covenants  which we are required to satisfy 
we cannot assure you that we will satisfy all such covenants in the future 
we cannot assure you that if we default on any of the covenants  we could obtain a waiver of the default from the lender 
in the event of default on any of these covenants  no further amounts would be advanced to us under any facility  the entire amounts outstanding could become due and payable immediately upon default  and those assets that are collateral could be seized  unless such default is waived by the lender 
to date we have received limited revenues from product sales 
the continued development of our products will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct further research and development and testing  to establish commercial scale manufacturing and to market these products 
we expect to use significant amounts of cash for capital equipment and to support operations until product revenues increase 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the time and cost involved in obtaining any required regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents  successful completion of technological  manufacturing and market requirements  changes in existing research relationships  the availability of funding under government contracts  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  and the cost of manufacturing scale up and the amount and timing of future revenues 
we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately  during we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated revenue  primarily from government contracts  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in our plans or other events affecting conductus will not result in the expenditure of our resources before such time 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
statement no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in the financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for disclosures related to the revenue recognition policies 
we are currently in the process of assessing the implications of these statements and have not yet determined the impact of their adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk conductus general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
our exposure to financial market risks relates primarily to our exposure to the impact of changes in interest rates on our fixed income investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed income investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain a portfolio that consists primarily of short term  high quality commercial paper and foreign debt 
all of our fixed income investments have maturities of less than one year 
hence  our exposure related to changes in interest rates is somewhat limited due to the short term nature of our portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
debt obligations conductus outstanding debt consists of term loan obligations that are primarily based on fixed rates 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited because any increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on our debt obligations
