although rebar merchant volumes were up in tons over  nearly all of the unit growth was offset by decreased selling prices which prevailed in the later half of the year 
the decrease in sbq segment sales were attributable to lower volumes and pricing pressures 
in addition  in the fourth quarter  the company reduced shipments of lower margin industrial quality products and focused efforts on higher margin sbq products

in december  the company announced suspension of operations at the memphis facility 
the company has completed the shut down at memphis and expects to incur ongoing costs of approximately million per month to maintain the facility until it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
restructuring costs operating results  from continuing operations for fiscal were significantly impacted by the unwinding of discontinued operations accounting  which required the company to reverse million million after tax of reserves which had been established in for estimated losses to be incurred on and until disposition of the sbq operations 
although the discontinued operations reserves were reversed in the second quarter of fiscal  most of the previous charges were restored through charges to continuing operations to fairly state sbq assets  liabilities  and operating results 
following is a summary of asset impairment and restructuring charges for the sbq operations  which offset a substantial portion of the income from reversal of the discontinued operations loss in thousands asset impairment memphis facility  loss on purchase commitment air  asset impairment sbq division goodwill  severance and termination benefits memphis  in addition  the million write down of the company s investment in air originally recognized as a part of the estimated loss on disposal was restored as an allowance for permanent impairment in fiscal management s decisions to shut down the memphis melt shop and actively pursue a strategy to sell its interest in air or sell the assets of air will result in significant future savings and improved operating results 
among other things  because the memphis facility is an asset held for sale  annual depreciation of million will not be charged to future operations 
monthly operating losses at memphis are expected to decrease by approximately million 
also  future purchases of dri from air will be reflected in cost of sales at market cost  rather than at the higher contracted price the company must pay under the dri purchase contract with air 
in addition  as a result of the write off of sbq division goodwill  annual amortization expenses will decrease by million 
other costs the company also incurred other unusual charges during fiscal  including the following in thousands proxy solicitation costs  executive severance costs  asset impairment assets retired  debt amendment costs  proxy solicitation costs  principally consisting of legal  public relations and other consulting fees  were incurred in the company s defense of a proxy contest led by the united company shareholder group the united group

correnti as chairman and chief executive officer and reconstituting the board of directors to include a total of twelve directors  nine of which were appointed by the united group and three of which were appointed by previous management 
the charges include approximately million to reimburse the united group for certain of its costs in connection with the proxy contest  which was settled by issuing  shares of the company s common stock to the united company during the third quarter 
as a result of the proxy contest  a total of six executives  including the former ceo  were severed during fiscal those executives were covered by the company s executive severance plan  which provides for specified benefits after a change in control  as defined in the plan  among other triggering events 
in conjunction with the may  amendments to the company s borrowing agreements  the company incurred million in legal and financial consulting fees

the company is currently limited as to the amount of capital expenditures it can make under capital spending programs and does not expect significant levels of capital expenditures or capitalized interest during fiscal refer to liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
fiscal compared to interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased borrowings on the company s revolving credit line during the year 
depressed selling prices and lower shipment volumes in the company s sbq operations reduced the company s operating cash flows during the year 
these factors  along with capital spending to complete the company s capital projects at cartersville and other facilities contributed to increased borrowing throughout fiscal the company also amended its debt agreements during the second quarter of fiscal  which  along with overall increases in market rates  led to an increase in the company s average borrowing rate 
the company s average long term borrowing rate was in fiscal versus in fiscal in fiscal  the impact of the increase in total interest costs was offset  in part  by increased capitalized interest  principally associated with capital spending at cartersville 
income tax the effective tax rate in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the establishment of a million valuation allowance principally related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  adversely impacted the effective tax rate 
a valuation allowance was established to reserve the company s net deferred tax assets to zero based on uncertainty about the company s ability to realize future tax benefits through offset to future taxable income

in connection wit the may amendments  the company issued stock warrants in lieu of cash payments for modification fees and granted additional security interests in bse s assets to the lenders 

as a result of these negotiations the company agreed to achieve certain cash flow performance levels at the cleveland sbq operations beginning with the quarter ending september  in addition  if the company does not sell or otherwise dispose of the sbq segment by january   the company will incur a basis point increase in the interest rates under the revolving credit agreement and each of the senior notes  which would be reduced to basis points upon a subsequent sale of the sbq segment 
also  in the event the company is unable to sell or restart the memphis facility by january   the company will incur increased rental expense on equipment subject to an operating lease at memphis 
based upon the current level of the company s operations and current industry conditions  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations for the next twelve months to meet day to day operating expenses and material commitments and remain in compliance with restrictive covenants in its principal debt and lease agreement 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient resources to make all required interest and principal payments under its revolving credit agreements and senior notes through december  however  the company is required to make significant principal repayments on december  and  accordingly  may be required to refinance its obligations under the revolving credit agreement and senior notes on or prior to such date 
management is currently evaluating alternatives for refinancing substantially all of the company s long term debt 
however  there can be no assurance that any such refinancing will be possible or  if possible  that acceptable terms could be obtained  particularly in view of the company s high level of debt 
on may   the company restructured its obligation to purchase direct reduced iron dri from american iron reduction air 
both the company and its joint venture partner co sponsor have agreed to purchase air s dri production during the remaining term of the air project finance agreements 
pursuant to the new agreements  the company has agreed to purchase up to  metric tons of dri per year if tendered by air which can be offset by one half of third party direct sales made by air 
the lenders agreed to restructure the existing debt agreements with air and forgive any defaults by air as of the closing date 
the company intends to actively pursue a settlement of its obligations to purchase dri from air 
the company is actively seeking a buyer for the air facility 
until the facility is sold the company and the co sponsor will remain obligated under the dri purchase agreement 
if future market prices for dri continue to be less than the price the company is obligated to pay  the company will continue to incur losses on future merchant dri activities 
currently  the market price of dri is approximately per ton less than the price the company is required to pay under the air purchase commitment 
pursuant to the company s current obligation to purchase dri from air at its current level and assuming no change to the market price of dri  the company would absorb approximately million per year in excess dri costs 
the company established reserves of million in the second quarter of fiscal to cover losses on future dri purchases under the purchase commitment and the ultimate settlement of the contract  which management expects to be paid upon early termination of the contract 
as is the case with all estimates that involve predictions of future outcomes  management s estimate of the loss on the dri purchase commitment is subject to change 
the principal factors which could cause the actual results to vary are the length of time the company remains obligated under the purchase commitment until an acceptable sale of the air facility can be completed  the proceeds from the sale which directly impact the amount of the termination payment  fluctuations in the market price of dri and changes in air s production costs  which have increased significantly as a result of the recent rise in natural gas prices 
in addition  pursuant to the agreements entered into with the senior noteholders  the company is generally restricted from making payments to air in excess of the amounts presently required under its agreements related to air and may be restricted  subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreements with the senior noteholders  to obtain the approval of its senior noteholders to enter into an agreement to terminate or settle any of its obligations relating to air 
in july  the board authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company may purchase up to million shares of its common stock in the open market at prices not to exceed as of december   the company had purchased  shares of its stock pursuant to this program 
the company has no present intention to resume repurchases under the authorization in the near term and is prohibited from purchasing shares under its amended long term debt agreements 
outlook the success of the company in the near term will depend in large part  on the company s ability to a minimize losses in its sbq operations  b dispose of the memphis facility  and c realize sufficient proceeds either from the sale or operations of the remaining sbq operations in cleveland to enable the company to reduce its debt and return to profitability 
however  management s outlook for the rebar merchant operations  which have performed consistently in recent years  is positive 
the company believes that start up costs at cartersville will diminish through the first quarter of fiscal the cartersville facility will enable expansion of the company s merchant product line and leverage melting capacity throughout the organization 
with continued emphasis on a shift in product mix towards higher margin merchant products  the company expects to be able to improve operating results at its rebar merchant mini mills by increasing volumes  reducing costs and improving gross margins 
while the company is confident of its ability to realize the benefits of rationalizing the sbq operations  the level of benefits to be realized could be affected by a number of factors including  without limitations  a the company s ability i to obtain any consents and approvals which may be required from its creditors to sell the sbq assets  ii to find a strategic buyer or buyers willing to acquire the sbq assets at prices that fairly value the assets  and iii to operate the company as planned in light of the highly leveraged nature of the company  and b changes in the condition of the steel industry in the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the company is exposed to market risk from financial instruments that could occur upon adverse changes in interest rates principally us treasury and prime bank rates 
in order to manage this risk  the company attempts to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
at june   the company had fixed rate long term debt with a carrying value of million and variable rate borrowings of million outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates with no change in the average or outstanding amounts of long term debt  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would decrease by million 
however  the company does not expect that those debt obligations could be settled or repurchased in the open market at the lower amount in the ordinary course of business 
the company also would incur an additional million in interest expense per year on variable rate borrowings 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s cost of borrowing 
the analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
