item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business conditions the company is principally engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and marketing graphite carbon fiber based composite golf club shafts  with approximately of its net sales resulting from sales to golf club manufacturers for inclusion in their clubs 
as a result  the company s operating results are substantially dependent not only on demand by its customers for the company s shafts  but also on demand by consumers for clubs including graphite shafts such as the company s 
in  the company established a manufacturing facility in evanston  wyoming for the production of carbon fiber 
during and through the first ten months of  the company has used the material from this facility to satisfy a significant portion of its internal demand for carbon fiber in the manufacturing of golf club shafts 
during  the company also produced and sold carbon fiber from this facility to other unrelated entities for the manufacture of other carbon based products 
on october   sgl carbon fibers and composite  inc sgl purchased a interest in the company s carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
the company and sgl entered into an agreement to operate the facility as a limited liability company with equal ownership interests between the venture partners 
the company and sgl also entered into supply agreements with the new entity  carbon fiber technology llc cft  for the purchase of carbon fiber at cost plus an agreed mark up 
profits and losses of cft will be shared equally by the partners 
the company anticipates that the carbon fiber from this facility will primarily be consumed by the joint venture partners  however  any excess carbon fiber produced at this facility could be marketed for sale to unrelated third parties 
the company does not expect third party sales at cft nor the sale of graphite prepreg to have a significant effect on either its sales or profitability for several issues 
historically  graphite shafts have principally been offered by manufacturers of higher priced  premium golf clubs  and the company s sales have been predominantly of premium graphite shafts 
however  in recent years the company has realized substantial sales growth in the value priced segment of the graphite shaft market 
the company now competes aggressively with primarily united states based shaft manufacturers for premium graphite shafts and also against primarily foreign based shaft manufacturers for lower priced value shaft sales 
the company continues to maintain a broad customer base in the premium shaft market segment 
while the company s market share in the value segment is not as great as the premium segment  the company has advanced rapidly in securing new customers in this segment in recent years 
presently  there exists substantial excess graphite shaft manufacturing capacity both in the united states and in other countries 
this has had the effect  and is expected by management to continue to have the effect for at least the next several years  of decreasing the selling prices of the company s shafts 
although the company s gross profit margin is being adversely affected by the reduction in selling prices  the adverse effects on gross margin have been mitigated in the past to some extent by efforts being taken by the company to control costs  including obtaining lower prices for its raw materials and manufacturing its own graphite prepreg  and should be mitigated to some extent in the future as the company increases the percentage of its shafts being manufactured in countries with lower labor and overhead costs 
in recent years  the company s results of operations have been materially affected on several occasions by dramatic year to year changes in sales to an individual golf club manufacturer customer 
such changes can result either from decisions by the customer to increase or decrease shaft purchases from an alternative supplier or from the traditional volatility in consumer demand for specific clubs 
the company believes that this volatility is likely to continue in the future  particularly as club manufacturers seek to gain competitive advantages through an increased rate of technological innovation in club design 
the company s results will benefit whenever it has an opportunity to supply shafts for the latest hot club and will be adversely affected whenever sales of clubs containing aldila shafts drop dramatically 
in particular  in recent years  a significant portion of the company s sales has tended to be concentrated in one or two customers  thereby making the company s results of operations dependent to a large extent on continued sales to taylor made  callaway and ping 
in  sales to taylor made golf  callaway golf company and ping represented  and  respectively  of the company s total net sales 
the company expects taylor made  callaway and ping to continue to be the company s largest customers  at least through the company believes that while it will often not be possible to predict  with any certainty  shifts in demand for particular clubs  the company s broad range of club manufacturer customers should reduce in some cases the extent of the impact on the company s financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating results expressed as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill plant consolidation operating income loss other interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for from million for the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was attributable to decreased shaft unit sales at lower selling prices to the company s club manufacturer customers partially offset by a million increase in sales of other carbon fiber products in as compared to shaft unit sales decreased in as compared to which was a result of lower demand for both premium and value shafts  and the average selling price of shafts sold in decreased due to the highly competitive market environment 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of the decrease in net sales 
gross profit was negatively impacted in by million in charges against cost of sales related to higher cost carbon fiber produced in evanston  wyoming in which was consumed in  a charge of million for a write down of carbon fiber inventory not included in the joint venture transaction with sgl  as well as higher fixed costs per unit for shafts shipped in based on lower production volume 
as a result of these factors  the company s gross profit margin decreased to in from in operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  to a million loss in from million operating income in and decreased as a percentage of net sales to a loss of in compared to income of in selling  general and administrative expense decreased million from but increased as a percentage of net sales to in as compared to in primarily as a result of lower net sales in as compared to the company has reflected plant consolidation charges in million and million primarily in connection with the consolidation of its domestic golf shaft manufacturing operations in rancho bernardo  california into its facility in poway  california

the increase in net sales was attributable to increased shaft unit sales to the company s club manufacturer customers as well as a million increase in sales of other carbon fiber products in as compared to shaft unit sales increased in as compared to  which was offset by a decrease in the average selling price of shafts sold  as a result of a change in product mix to lower priced value shafts 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in principally as a result of the increase in net sales 
gross profit was negatively impacted in by million in charges against cost of sales related to production ramp up in the new facility in evanston  wyoming million and inventory markdowns on carbon fiber recorded in the fourth quarter of million 
including these charges  the company s gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in before considering these charges  gross profit margin in increased by over the gross profit margin to 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in selling  general and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of net sales to in as compared to in primarily as a result of lower advertising  promotional and other administrative expenses in compared to the company has reflected plant consolidation charges in million and million in connection with the consolidation of its domestic golf shaft manufacturing operations in rancho bernardo  california into its facility in poway  california 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note interest expense 
interest expense was million in and million in a total of million in long term borrowings remained outstanding during each period 
in  million of interest was capitalized during the construction period for the company s new carbon fiber manufacturing facility 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings was in and income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate in was as compared to in the decrease resulted primarily from the increase in profit before tax with constant non deductible amortization of goodwill in each year 
liquidity and capital resources the company has in place a million revolving credit facility from a financial institution which is secured by substantially all the assets of aldila golf and guaranteed by the company 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest  at the election of the company  at the bank reference rate or at the adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
availability for borrowings under the line of credit was approximately million at year end the company has million in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at 
semi annual principal payments of million  plus accrued interest  are due on march and september through september  on october   the company received approximately million from the sale of a interest in its carbon fiber manufacturing operation 
these funds are included in working capital as of december  and are available for the scheduled principal payments due under the senior notes 
cash including cash equivalents provided by operating activities in was million compared to in this increase resulted principally from a decrease in working capital 
the company used million for capital expenditures during  primarily related to the completion of construction of a shaft manufacturing facility in china 
management anticipates capital expenditures to approximate million for the company may also incur capital expenditures over the next several years to expand and enhance the production capacity of the cft operation in evanston  wyoming in order to take advantage of new opportunities brought to cft and further reduce production costs for the carbon fiber acquired by the company  in addition to an obligation to support one half of cft s fixed annual cost 
the company believes that it will have adequate cash resources  including anticipated cash flow and borrowing availability to meet its obligations at least through the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s business 
the company could require additional debt financing if it were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
seasonality because the company s customers have historically built inventory in anticipation of purchases by golfers in the spring and summer  the principal selling season for golf equipment  the company s operating results have been affected by seasonal demand for golf clubs  which has generally resulted in highest sales occurring in the second quarter 
the timing of customers new product introductions has frequently mitigated the impact of seasonality in recent years 
year the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by the inability of the company s information systems and the information systems of its major customers and suppliers to process data having dates on or after january  the year issues 
the company has evaluated its information technology it and non it systems  including but not limited to computer hardware and software  alarm systems  manufacturing equipment and software  and all other mechanical equipment  to determine areas of exposure to potential year issues 
the company has not experienced any significant problems related to the year issue to date 
the possibility exists that the company s manufacturing operations could be affected by external suppliers systems that are not year compliant 
key risk areas identified by the company include its energy suppliers to the cft facility in evanston  wyoming as well as electrical providers to the company in tijuana  mexico and zhuhai  china 
if one of these providers is not able to provide the necessary requirements to the company  there likely would not be a reasonable alternative available to the company and as a result the company s business could be negatively impacted 
to date  the company has not expended a significant amount in identifying and fixing year issues and estimates it will not incur a significant amount for remediation of its remaining year issues 
total expenditures are not expected to exceed  the company does not expect significant year issues subsequent to the fiscal year end 
although the company believes it has taken the appropriate steps to address year readiness  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition
