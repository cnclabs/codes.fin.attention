item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gum tech develops and manufactures specialty chewing gum products for branded and private label customers  as well as products marketed under its own brand labels 
specialty chewing gums include vitamins  herbals and active over the counter drug ingredients formulated to provide specific health related benefits to the user 
gum tech currently targeted four market segments oral care  smoking cessation  dietary supplement  and over the counter otc drug 
a substantial majority of gum tech s sales from its gum operations currently are attributable to products developed  manufactured and packaged by gum tech for marketing and sale by five branded and private label consumer products companies 
in january  gum tech entered into a joint venture with biodelivery technologies  inc to manufacture  market and distribute zicam  a nasal gel formula 
under an operating agreement signed on may   gum tech and biodelivery technologies transferred their respective interests in the patent rights to the nasal gel technology used in zicam in exchange for membership interests in gel tech llc  an arizona limited liability company 
gum tech has a interest in the capital and profits of the joint venture and has provided million of capital to the joint venture 
gum tech reports financial results of gel tech llc on a consolidated basis  but identifies certain information by its two business segments chewing gum operations and zicam operations 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table details certain financial information for our chewing gum and zicam operations for the year ended december  chewing gum zicam consolidated net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses    research and development    income loss from operations    interest and other income    interest expense   income loss before income tax    chewing gum operations certain information is set forth below for our chewing gum operations expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   operating expenses   research and development   income loss from operations   interest and other income   interest expense   provision benefit for income taxes net income loss   net sales 
net sales increased to approximately million for the months ended december   or above the prior year 
this increase reflects the addition of several new customers and or products in mid to late among these were ranir dcp  breath asure  heritage consumer products acutrim r gum and pharmagreen ltd 
sales in the prior year largely reflect sales of cigarest s smoking cessation gum  herbalife s diet and energy gums  aspergum r and chooz r and initial deliveries of breath asure dental gum tm 
although sales to our five principal gum customers have contributed significantly to our growth in sales over the past two years  we do not anticipate additional growth in sales to these customers in the coming year  and sales to these customers may in fact decline 
we expect that any future growth in our chewing gum operations will result primarily from the addition of new contract relationships with new partners  including the recently announced relationship with swedish match 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to attract any new partners  or that any joint venture with any new partners will ultimately prove successful 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to approximately million  or approximately  above the prior year  due to the higher level of sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million reflecting both the higher level of sales and improvement in our manufacturing processes 
operating expenses 
operating expenses declined by approximately million from the level to million in the amount for includes unusual one time charges of  to reflect the cost of an extension of options to a former officer   for options granted to another individual  and  representing a severance compensation expense 
exclusive of these charges  operating expenses in were  or approximately million greater than the level 
the reduction in normal recurring operating expenses in was principally due to a reduction in advertising  trade show and travel expense of  due to the change in corporate strategy in  lower legal expenses of  due to costs associated with the management restructuring in early  and the allocation of administrative and warehousing expenses to gel tech llc of  in interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased due to a lower cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from by  to approximately million primarily due to interest charges associated with the citadel financing in june included in these amounts were a number of non cash interest charges associated with this financing 
this financing  together with the company s outstanding term loan facility  were redeemed in full in the first quarter of  which we anticipate will virtually eliminate interest expense in subsequent quarters 
income loss before provision for income taxes and minority interest 
net loss decreased by approximately million primarily due to the substantial decrease in operating expenses offset in part by higher interest expense 
despite the anticipated reduction in interest charges  gum operations will continue to record a net loss in the future until sales of gum products increase 
zicam operations zicam sales and operations began january  as a result  the financial results for zicam operations cannot be compared to the prior period 
for the year ended december   zicam operations recorded net sales of approximately million 
the bulk of zicam sales occurred late in the fourth quarter of after widespread national publicity in november resulted in unexpectedly high demand for this new product 
initially  production of zicam could not be increased sufficiently to meet this high level of demand 
consequently  deliveries of zicam were delayed 
due to the highly seasonal nature of cold remedies such as zicam and a relatively short cold season  these delays limited our ability to realize the full potential of zicam sales for the cold season 
gross profit on zicam for the months ended december  was approximately million  or of net sales 
operating expenses of million were recorded for this period  of which approximately million was spent  or accrued for advertising  sales commissions  public relations and other sales expenses 
research and development expenses of  for this period largely reflect the cost of on going clinical work associated with zicam 
interest and other income largely reflects interest income associated with invested cash 
gel tech did not have any debt outstanding during this period and consequently did not record any interest expense 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table presents certain statement of operations information expressed in dollars and as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended december net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   operating expenses   research development   income loss from operations   interest and other income   interest expense   provision benefit for income taxes net income loss   net sales 
net sales for were million  approximately above the level 
sales in reflect the change in the company s strategy early in the year to a focus on contract manufacturing whereas sales in largely reflect sales of cigarrest  which the company marketed  and sales of the company s own gum products 
sales in included deliveries of diet and energy gums to herbalife in the first half of the year  aspergum an analgesic gum  and chooz an antacid gum in the second quarter  breath asure dental gum in the third quarter  and ranir dcp private label dental gum  accutrim a diet gum  seven different gums to pharma green and a dental gum to ecodent in the fourth quarter 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million  approximately  above the level  primarily reflecting the increased level of sales 
in  the company recorded sales under its barter agreements at a zero value with a cost of sales of  adjusting for this cost  the cost of sales for was million  or of net sales 
the improvement in the gross profit percentage from in to in is due to increased utilization of plant facilities resulting in lower per unit overhead costs and the efficiencies realized by producing larger quantities of the same gum 
both periods were impacted by sizable write offs of obsolete inventory  in and  in 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased to  reflecting the higher level of sales and increased utilization of plant facilities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in were significantly impacted by one time charges related to the management restructuring that occurred in early and continuing charges attributable to the company s prior corporate strategy 
these charges resulted from an extension of stock options to a former officer of the company million and an expense to reflect options owed to another individual  both of which were non cash charges  and severance compensation to certain corporate officers 
excluding these items  operating expenses were million  or  less than the level  which is primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising expenses 
research development 
research development expenses increased in to  from  in due to the introduction of more than new gum products in  including three that contained over the counter drugs 
research and development expenses include the cost of formulation  process and ingredient validation  and production scale up costs of new products as well as costs of product concepts still under study 
interest and other income 
interest income declined in from due to a decrease in the company s invested cash position during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased due to the refinancing and restructuring of an equipment lease in late to a term loan and conversion into common stock of approximately million in principal amount of the company s convertible debt in the second half of net income loss 
the net loss for was million compared to million the prior year 
although the results for were negatively impacted by some significant one time charges  the company continued to experience a sizable loss in due to insufficient sales to support the company s overhead expenses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   gum tech s working capital was approximately million compared to million at december  during the months ended december   gum tech experienced a decrease in cash used by operating activities of approximately million  versus million the prior year 
the decrease in cash for is largely attributable to the increase in accounts receivable primarily associated with sales of zicam in the fourth quarter million offset in part by the minority interest in earnings of consolidated affiliates and a provision for sales returns and allowances 
investing activities used  of cash for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the amount reflects expenditures to expand our gum operations 
financing activities provided approximately million of cash for the year ended december  compared to million in approximately million of the amount reflects net proceeds realized from the citadel financing in june details of the citadel financing are contained in our current report on form k filed on june  proceeds realized from the exercise of options and warrants contributed approximately million versus million in gum tech issued  shares of common stock to citadel investment group in to redeem million of senior secured notes and million of series a preferred stock and issued an additional  shares of common stock in early to redeem the remaining million of citadel debt and preferred stock 
factors that may affect future operating results and financial condition this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our anticipated growth in business and future results of operations 
these forward looking statements are based on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include less than anticipated demand for our chewing gum or nasal gel products  such as zicam  lack of market acceptance for or uncertainties concerning the efficacy of zicam  fluctuations in seasonal demand for zicam relative to the cold season  difficulties in increasing production to meet unexpectedly high demand in the short term  a decrease in the level of reorders from existing customers  financial difficulties encountered by one or more of our principal customers  difficulties in obtaining additional capital for marketing  research and development  and other expenses  the possibility of material charges incurred as a result of prior activities  aggressive pricing and marketing efforts by rival gum manufacturers  unavailability of third party material products at reasonable prices  inventory obsolescence due to shifts in market demand  and material litigation involving patent and contractual claims  product liabilities and consumer issues 
these potential risks and uncertainties  together with those mentioned below and elsewhere in this report  could affect our future operating results  financial condition  and the market price of its common stock 
information contained in this report includes forward looking statements  which can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  should  or anticipates or by discussions of trends or strategy 
we may not achieve the future results discussed in these forward looking statements 
the following matters constitute cautionary statements identifying important factors that relate to the forward looking statements 
we incurred significant losses in previous years we began operations in february and have a limited operating history upon which potential investors may evaluate our performance 
we reported significant losses for the last four years 
although we earned a profit for the fourth quarter of  we incurred a loss for the year ended december  in addition  despite achieving a profit in the fourth quarter of  our future operations may not be profitable 
the likelihood of our success must be considered relative to the problems  difficulties  complications  and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development and operation of a new business  the significant change in strategy in early  and the development and marketing of zicam  a relatively new product 
if zicam does not gain market widespread acceptance  our anticipated sales and results of operations will suffer in  gel tech llc  a joint venture in which we hold a interest in profits and capital  launched a new homeopathic cold remedy known as zicam 
although studies have indicated that zicam can significantly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold  there is no guarantee that the product will achieve widespread acceptance by the market 
if any unanticipated problem arises concerning the efficacy of zicam or the product fails to achieve widespread market acceptance for any reason  our prospects for our future operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  although initial sales of zicam were significant  there is no assurance that demand for this product will continue to grow  especially following the peak of the cold season 
we may be unable to meet demand for our new products to the extent zicam or any other new product we introduce achieves widespread market acceptance and generates significant demand  we may be unable to produce and deliver sufficient quantities of the product to meet our customers demands on a timely basis 
if so  we could lose opportunities to sell larger quantities of the product and damage relationships with distributors whose orders could not be timely filled 
this problem  if encountered  could be particularly damaging if we are not able to meet customer demand during the cold season  when we expect demand for sales of zicam to peak 
unanticipated problems associated with product development could delay or hinder introduction of new products we may experience unanticipated difficulties in developing new products that could delay or prevent the introduction of those products 
we may be dependent in the near future upon chewing gum products that are currently being developed 
if we are unable to develop new chewing gum products on a timely basis  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our reliance upon a few gum customers may negatively impact our financial results the shift in our chewing gum strategy in early to a focus on contract manufacturing has made our chewing gum operations dependent for sales and future growth on a few customers 
these customers include herbalife  breath asure  ranir  heritage consumer products and pharmagreen 
while the decision to partner with these firms relieves us of the direct responsibility to market products  we become dependent on the financial resources and marketing capabilities of third parties 
further  we are at risk for their non payment or late payment for amounts owed to us 
while we intend to add to this portfolio of customers to reduce the risk of non performance by any single customer  we have not yet been successful in that effort 
our inability to provide scientific proof for product claims may adversely affect our sales the marketing of certain of our chewing gum and nasal gel products  including zicam  involves claims that these products assist in weight loss  promote dental hygiene  and reduce the duration of the common cold  among others 
under fda and ftc rules  we are required to obtain scientific data to support any health claims we make concerning our products 
although we have not provided nor been requested to provide any scientific data to the fda in support of claims regarding our products  we have obtained scientific data for all of our products 
there can be no assurance that the scientific data we have obtained in support of our claims will be deemed acceptable to the fda or ftc  should either agency request any such data in the future 
if the fda or the ftc requests any supporting information  and we are unable to provide support that is acceptable to the fda or the ftc  either agency could force us to stop making the claims in question or restrict us from selling the affected products 
fda and other government regulation may restrict our ability to sell our products we are subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting our business 
our chewing gum and nasal gel products are subject to regulation by the fda  including regulations with respect to labeling of products  approval of ingredients in products  claims made regarding the products  and disclosure of product ingredients 
if we do not comply with these regulations  the fda could force us to stop selling the affected products or incur substantial costs in adopting measures to maintain compliance with these regulations 
our advertising claims regarding our products are subject to the jurisdiction of the ftc as well as the fda 
in both cases we are required to obtain scientific data to support any advertising or labeling health claims we make concerning our products  although no pre clearance or filing is required to be made with either agency 
if we are unable to provide the required support for such claims  the ftc may stop us from making such claims or require us to stop selling the related product 
we may be unable to successfully expand our operations we intend to continue expanding our manufacturing and marketing operations 
expansion will place substantial strains on our management and our operational  accounting  and information systems 
successful management of growth will require us to improve our financial controls  operating procedures  and management information systems  and to train  motivate  and manage our employees 
in addition  to the extent that actual demand for our products in the future is less than anticipated  we may incur higher than necessary costs in preparing for an anticipated growth in sales that does not materialize or materializes more slowly than expected 
failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy 
we may be unable to prevent others from developing similar products we routinely seek trademark and patent protection from the united states patent office and from similar agencies in foreign countries for chewing gum brands and have done so for zicam 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend any trademarks  trade names or patents against claims from or use by competitors or that trademark  trade name or patent applications will be approved by the uspo or any similar foreign agency 
we consider some of our chewing gum formulations and processes to be proprietary in nature and rely upon a combination of non disclosure agreements  other contractual restrictions and trade secrecy laws to protect such proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or that our competitors will not independently develop chewing gum formulations and processes that are substantially equivalent or superior to our own 
the large number of shares eligible for immediate and future sales may depress the price of our stock sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the open market or the availability of a large number of additional shares for sale could adversely affect the market price for the common stock 
substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock  as well as the shares underlying vested but as yet unexercised warrants and options  have either been registered for public sale or may be sold under rule promulgated under the securities act 
therefore  all of these shares may be immediately sold by the holders 
a substantial increase in the volume of trading in our stock may depress the price of our common stock 
the price of our stock may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
factors such as our operating results or public announcements may cause the market price of our stock to decline quickly 
market prices for securities of many small capitalization companies have experienced wide fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general economic indicators and other factors beyond our control 
we may incur significant costs resulting from product liability claims we are subject to significant liability should use or consumption of our products cause injury  illness or death 
although we carry product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to protect us against product liability claims or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms
