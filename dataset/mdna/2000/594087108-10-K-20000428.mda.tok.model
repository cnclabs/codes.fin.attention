item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in those forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  and particularly in risk factors 
overview we are the largest national specialty retailer providing materials  ideas and education for creative activities 
we operate michaels stores in states  as well as canada and puerto rico  which offer products for the do it yourself home decorator  art supplies and craft supplies 
we also operate aaron brothers stores  primarily on the west coast  which offer photo frames  a full line of ready made frames  custom framing services and a wide selection of art supplies 
during the early s  we embarked on an aggressive national expansion program 
by  we had tripled our store base to over stores through new store openings and acquisitions  accomplishing our goal of becoming the nation s largest specialty retailer in our industry 
however  as a result of the lack of adequate information systems and infrastructure to support our rapid growth  our financial results began to weaken 
in  we hired michael rouleau  our chief executive officer  who has focused on increasing the profitability of our existing stores by implementing a variety of operating initiatives 
these initiatives included strengthening the quality and depth of our management team  installing pos systems chainwide to record item level sales  increasing the number of skus replenished from our distribution centers  standardizing our merchandise assortments across our store base and eliminating non core merchandise 
during  we continued to focus on key initiatives  including increasing the number of skus replenished and shipped from our distribution centers to our stores  testing a new store prototype and store opening process  and improving merchandising in our stores 
with the success of these initiatives  we accelerated our new store opening strategy in and  opening michaels stores and aaron brothers stores in  and michaels stores and aaron brothers stores in included in our michaels store openings are stores for which we acquired the leases from mjdesigns  inc we plan to continue our aggressive store opening strategy by opening michaels stores in fiscal  and to michaels stores in each of the subsequent three years 
we plan to open aaron brothers stores in fiscal  and to aaron brothers stores in each of the subsequent three years 
we expect to spend on average  in capital expenditures   in pre opening costs and  in net inventory for a new michaels store and  in capital expenditures   in pre opening costs and  in net inventory for a new aaron brothers store 
all pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
in addition to new store openings  we continued to pursue a store relocation program to improve the quality and performance of our existing store base 
during and  we relocated and michaels stores  respectively  and and aaron brothers stores  respectively 
we plan to relocate michaels stores and aaron brothers stores during fiscal during and  we closed and michaels stores  respectively  and and no aaron brothers stores  respectively 
we plan to close michaels stores and no aaron brothers stores during fiscal our fiscal year includes or weeks and ends on the saturday closest to january fiscal  fiscal and fiscal had weeks 
for purposes of calculating comparable store sales  a store is deemed to become comparable in its th full month of operations in order to eliminate grand opening sales distortions 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of income 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross margin selling  general and administrative expense store pre opening costs operating income interest expense other income and expense  net litigation settlement income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in the fiscal year ended january  increased million  or  over the fiscal year ended january  
the results for included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from michaels and no aaron brothers store closures 
sales at the new stores net of closures during accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
same store sales increased in compared to  which contributed million to the net sales increase 
the improvement in same store sales was due to a strong performance in our core categories of framing  general crafts  art supplies  floral  ribbon  home decor and books as well as substantial increases in the seasonal product categories 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for was  a decrease of compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to improved initial markup on inventories and improvements in the margins associated with fourth quarter promotional activities and better margins on season end clearance merchandise 
this decrease was partially offset by larger investments in information systems infrastructure and higher occupancy costs associated with new and relocated stores 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in compared to this decrease resulted from improved expense leverage in store payroll and related expenses  partially offset by higher bank fees associated with an increase in the percentage of sales via credit card 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in compared to  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior year 
operating income  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in compared to this improvement represented a increase over the prior year  on a increase in net sales  to million compared to million in the prior year 
interest expense net of interest income  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by for compared to this decrease resulted from a leveraging of interest expense on expanded sales  partially offset by lower invested cash balances in compared to on august   we reached an agreement to settle certain outstanding litigation and  accordingly  we recorded a million charge in the second quarter to reflect the terms of the agreement 
the court approved the settlement on october  including the litigation settlement charge  net income in was million  or per share 
excluding the litigation settlement charge  net income in increased from the prior year to million compared to million in  and diluted earnings per share was per share compared to per share in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in increased million  or  over the fiscal year ended january  
the results for included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from michaels and aaron brothers store closures 
same store sales increased in the improvement in same store sales was due to a good performance in memory books  wood  beads  candles  art  books and yarn  more than offsetting the performance in apparel crafts  seasonal  needlecrafts and ribbon 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for was  a decrease of compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to improvements in the initial markup and cost reductions in merchandise purchases  partially offset by increased occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  including higher rent reserves for store closures 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in compared to this decrease resulted from improved expense leverage in corporate general and administrative expense  advertising and depreciation 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  increased by in compared to  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior year 
interest expense  as a percentage of net sales  was for  a decrease of compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of leveraging the fixed interest costs over a larger sales base 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash principally to finance capital investment and inventory for new  relocated and expanded stores  and seasonal working capital 
we opened stores in and in  relocated stores in and stores in  and expanded stores in and stores in in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  the issuance of our senior notes and common stock  lease financing and proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal we anticipate spending approximately million to open new michaels and new aaron brothers stores  million for improvements in existing stores  million on information systems and distribution center projects  million on michaels 
com infrastructure  and million for various other capital investment activities 
we expect to spend on average approximately  including  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs  to open a new michaels store and  including  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs  to open a new aaron brothers store 
we anticipate that our new michaels and aaron brothers stores will become profitable within the first months of operation 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and amounts available under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements through fiscal on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we plan to continue our share repurchase program provided that market prices of our common stock make it advantageous for us to do so 
we are restricted by regulations of the securities and exchange commission from making repurchases during specified time periods 
finally  under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  we can only repurchase shares if specified financial ratios are maintained 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will repurchase any additional shares under our share repurchase program 
proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options have served as a source of cash for us  and we expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options in the future 
for  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million 
during  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million 
in october  we began issuing common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
the plan provides owners of shares of common stock with a convenient and economical method to purchase our common stock 
the plan also provides us with a cost efficient and flexible mechanism to raise equity capital 
during  we issued shares through the plan  generating  in proceeds 
during  we issued  shares through the plan  generating million of proceeds 
our net cash provided by operating activities in was million as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased profitability before depreciation and amortization 
our net cash used in investing activities in was million as compared to million during our cash used in investment activities resulted from opening michaels and aaron brothers stores and relocating michaels and aaron brothers stores during capital expenditures for the newly opened stores were approximately million  with additional capital expenditures of approximately million related to existing stores and information systems enhancements 
during  we opened michaels and aaron brothers stores and relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores 
capital expenditures for the newly opened stores were approximately million during our net cash provided by financing activities for was million as compared to net cash used of million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during  we received million resulting from the exercise of stock options covering  shares of our common stock  as compared to million resulting from the exercise of stock options covering  shares during the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was also the result of a decrease in the amount of share repurchases during during  we repurchased  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million as compared to  shares for an aggregate purchase price of million during our bank credit facility the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of million  which may be increased to million under specific conditions 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants  including those relating to the ratio of funded debt to total capital  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a capital expenditure limitation 
interest on all borrowings is determined based upon the type of borrowing and our fixed charge coverage ratio 
the interest rate on the credit agreement is generally a the higher of i an annual rate of interest announced from time to time by fleet national bank formerly bankboston  na or ii one half of one percent above the federal funds effective rate or b the eurodollar rate as defined by the credit agreement 
the company is required to pay a facility fee from 
to 
per annum on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
we are in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are available through august no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement at january  or at january   and borrowings were outstanding for days and days during our peak season of seasonal inventory buildup during and  respectively 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with higher sales in the third and fourth quarters 
historically  the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and excluding and approximately of our operating income 
risk factors our growth depends on our ability to open new stores our key business strategy is to expand our base of michaels and aaron brothers stores 
if we were unable to implement this strategy  our ability to increase our sales and profitability would be impaired significantly 
to the extent that we are unable to open new stores  our sales growth would come only from increases in comparable store sales 
growth in profitability in that case would depend on our ability to reduce our costs as a percentage of our sales 
we may be unable to implement our strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional stores  negotiate acceptable leases  access sufficient capital to support store growth or hire and train a sufficient number of employees 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  our key business strategy of expanding our store base  we may experience problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability 
for example the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores  the closure of unsuccessful stores may result in the retention of liability for expensive leases  a significant portion of our management s time and energy will be consumed which may possibly result in deterioration of our operating results  our expansion may outpace our planned technological advances with the consequent possibility of breakdowns in our supply chain management and increased weaknesses in our operational controls  we may be unable to hire and train qualified managers and other employees  our suppliers may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores  and we may be unable to expand our existing distribution centers and find suitable locations for new distribution centers or employ third party distribution processing services to provide merchandise for sale by our new stores 
we may fail to anticipate customer demands our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which would have a negative impact on our operating results 
conversely  shortages of key items could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our suppliers may fail us many of our suppliers are small and undercapitalized firms who produce a limited number of items 
given their limited resources  these firms are susceptible to production difficulties  quality control issues and problems in delivering agreed upon quantities on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we would be able  if necessary  to return product to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective 
these suppliers may be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions 
significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  exposing us to shifts in demand 
risks relating to foreign suppliers we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers of various products that we sell 
this reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political or economic conditions  transportation delays  restrictive actions by foreign governments or united states law and regulation affecting imports 
reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for whatever reason 
a significant portion of our inventory is manufactured in the people s republic of china 
under its current leadership  china has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
no assurance can be given  however  that china will continue to pursue such policies  that such policies will be successful if pursued or that such policies will not be significantly altered from time to time 
china s exports to the united states currently receive the same preferential tariff treatment accorded goods from countries granted normal trade relations status 
however  preferential tariff treatment for countries with nonmarket economies  including china  is granted one year at a time  and such treatment is renewed only upon the president s recommendation to congress that the objectives of us trade law will be served by extending preferential treatment for another year 
the annual renewal of china s normal trade relations status has been a contentious political issue for several years 
if china lost normal trade relations status  the import duty on goods manufactured in china and entering the united states would increase dramatically 
furthermore  china may be subject to retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by the united states under various provisions of the trade act of the imposition by the united states of increased tariffs  trade sanctions and subsequent actions by china would result in manufacturing and distribution disruptions or higher costs to us  which would adversely affect our operating results 
our information systems may prove inadequate we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
we will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve  upgrade and expand our systems 
in addition  we are in the process of upgrading our information systems to provide us with perpetual inventory and automatic replenishment capabilities  which we believe are extremely important in the management of a chain of hundreds of stores offering tens of thousands of skus 
delays in bringing these new capabilities on line  or disruptions from an imperfect introduction of these new capabilities  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
a weak fourth quarter would adversely affect our operating results our business is highly seasonal 
our inventories and short term financing rise in the second and third quarters as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth quarters 
our most important quarter in terms of sales and profitability historically has been the fourth quarter 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected  we could have substantial excess inventory  especially in seasonal merchandise that is difficult to liquidate  and the market price of our common stock probably would decline 
improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions and sales growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain  including merchandise ordering  transportation and receipt processing 
any failure to take full advantage of supply chain opportunities could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
competition could negatively impact our operations competition is intense in the retail arts and crafts industry 
this competition could result in the reduction of our prices and our loss of market share 
we must remain competitive in the areas of quality  price  selection and convenience 
our primary competition is comprised of specialty arts and crafts retailers 
our competitors include hobby lobby  ac moore arts crafts  inc  jo ann etc 
operated by jo ann stores  inc 
and garden ridge corporation 
we also compete with mass merchants that dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise  regional chains and local merchants 
some of our competitors  particularly the mass merchants  are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  alternative methods of selling crafts  such as over the internet  could result in additional competitors in the future 
furthermore  we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money market mutual funds and in short term interest bearing securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at january   approximated carrying value 
the interest rates on our revolving line of credit are repriced frequently  at market rates  which would result in carrying amounts that approximate fair value 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at january  we believe that the effect  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
the fair value of our senior notes and convertible subordinated notes long term debt was estimated to be million at january   which was million greater than carrying value 
generally  the fair value of our fixed interest rate long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates used by the dealers to quote the fair value of our long term debt at january   which would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million
