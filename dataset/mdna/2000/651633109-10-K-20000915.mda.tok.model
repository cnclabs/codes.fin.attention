income before the effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item was  or 
per share  for the year ended june  excluding the effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item newmil s income grew in  reflecting improved core earnings  driven by higher net interest income  a negative loan loss provision and slightly lower non interest expense  partly offset by a decrease in non interest income 
similarly  earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item increased  reflecting both the growth in net income and share repurchase activity 
effective october  newmil adopted the provisions of sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
newmil took advantage of the provisions of sfas by reclassifying securities totaling million from held to maturity to available for sale  and then sold those securities 
newmil realized a loss  net of tax  of  on the transfer and sale of these securities 
this loss has been reported separately in net income as the cumulative effect of adopting sfas the securities were previously carried below cost as held to maturity  and an unrealized loss  net of taxes  of  against these securities had been included in shareholders equity prior to their sale

this is attributed to a continuing strategy which includes refining both the mix and the quality of newmil s earning assets  increasing non interest income  controlling operating expenses  and reducing non performing assets 
the following discussion and analysis of newmil s consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
results of operations comparison between and analysis of net interest and dividend income net interest income increased  or  to  in this resulted from a basis point increase in the net interest margin and a lower volume of interest bearing liabilities

the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by newmil s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing within different future time periods 
interest income total interest and dividend income increased  or  to million in loan income increased  or  as a result of higher loan volume offset by lower average yield

although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions

newmil had a negative provision of  for loan losses in  down from a provision of  in and  in the reduction in the provision over the past three years is due principally to an ongoing improvement in loan quality as evidenced by the steady reduction in non performing loans over the past five years  offset in part by loan portfolio growth 
the negative provision  in  resulted from a loan loss recovery of  related to a loan that had been charged off in prior years 
the recovery represents cash received from the borrower s bankruptcy court proceedings 
during fiscal year non performing loans decreased  or  to  at june  and  as a result  the reserve coverage to non performing loans increased to at june  from at june  past due performing loans accruing loans days past due also decreased in and at june  represented of gross loans 
the decrease in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total gross loans during  to at june  compared to at june   is due to reduction in non performing loans offset by loan portfolio growth of million  or during loan growth has been primarily concentrated in commercial mortgage loans 
newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans 
for a discussion on loan quality see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement the allowance for loan losses at june   is adequate 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the fdic  in august and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the allowance for loan losses is computed by taking the portfolio and segregating it into various risk rating categories 
some loans have been further segregated and carry specific reserve amounts 
all other loans that do not have specific reserves assigned are reserved based on a loss percentage assigned to the outstanding balance 
the percentage applied to the outstanding balance varies depending on the risk rating 
in addition the bank maintains an unallocated reserve 
the level of unallocated reserves from june  to june  remained substantially the same 
non interest income non interest income decreased  or  to  in this decrease is attributable to gains on sales of oreo in  a decrease in loan sales in and security losses in  offset by an increase in service charges 
the principal categories of non interest income are as follows years ended june  change dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts   gains on sales of loans  net securities losses gains  net gain on branch sale gains on sales of oreo   loan servicing other total non interest income    the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in reflects increased transaction volume  resulting from growth in demand deposit and now accounts coupled with an increase in the bank s fee structure 
the loss from security sales was a result of the sale of three securities which had under performed due to higher than expected prepayment speeds 
the gain from the sale of a branch  in  is the result of an additional premium which resulted from certain competitive events not occurring within a time frame stipulated in the sale agreement for the winsted branch which was sold in may the decrease in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans resulted from loan sales of million in compared with million in secondary market loan sales are generally pre arranged on a loan by loan basis prior to origination and loans are sold service released 
the significant decrease in oreo gains in is a result of the low level of oreo that the bank had during the year 
the gains in resulted from the sale of two oreo properties and the sale of the bank s interest in a partnership formed several years ago to develop an oreo property into a residential subdivision 
the decrease in loan servicing fees in resulted from run off in the mortgage servicing portfolio  which at june  totaled million  down from million at june  any loans that the bank has sold  since  have been on a servicing released basis 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased  or  in the principal categories of operating expenses are as follows years ended june  change dollars in thousands salaries   employee benefits  occupancy equipment professional  collection and oreo expense insurance postage and telecommunications marketing service bureau other operating   total operating expenses   the increase in salaries in was due primarily to annual salary increases and higher incentive compensation awards which were offset by overtime  in  related to the conversion of the bank s core data processing systems to a new in house system 
the decrease in employee benefits results primarily from the recognition of net periodic pension income  on newmil s frozen defined benefit pension plan the plan  of  and from lower health benefits expenses in newmil was measuring net periodic pension cost for the first two quarters of the fiscal year under the premise that the plan would be terminated at sometime in fiscal during the quarter ended december   newmil made a strategic decision not to terminate the plan and will continue the plan in a frozen status 
this change in strategy was deemed a significant event per paragraph of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions which necessitated a change in measurement assumptions 
these different measurement assumptions resulted in  of pension income during the year as compared to  in the increase in occupancy and equipment expense is primarily due to higher depreciation expense and building maintenance expense in the increase in professional  collection and oreo expense is a result of the cost of additional consulting work related to various corporate initiatives that the bank undertook in marketing expense increased as a result of a cable tv campaign in all other operating expenses  including shareholder relations  office expense and other  decreased  or in income taxes net income for included an income tax provision of  for an effective tax rate of  as compared with an income tax provision of  for an effective tax rate of  for on may  connecticut legislation was passed which made sweeping changes to the corporation business tax treatment of banks and financial service companies 
the new law permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a new special purpose entity called a passive investment company pic 
in general  the pic can earn mortgage interest income  and pay dividends to its parent company  free from the connecticut corporation business tax 
the legislation was effective for income years commencing on or after january  newmil formed a pic and changed its tax year to a calendar year basis to take advantage of the connecticut statute 
effective january  newmil transferred mortgages into the pic and income of the pic and its dividends to newmil became exempt from the connecticut corporation business tax 
effective january   newmil s combined federal and state effective tax rate became 
the formation of the pic has required newmil to establish a valuation allowance against its existing deferred state tax assets that are no longer expected to be realized in future years 
the provision for the year ended june  included a one time charge of  related to the formation of the pic  as discussed above 
for further information on income taxes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effect of change in accounting principle and extraordinary item effective october  newmil adopted the provisions of sfas  reclassified securities totaling million from held to maturity to available for sale  and then sold those securities 
newmil realized a loss  net of tax  of  on the transfer and sale of these securities 
this loss has been reported separately in net income as the cumulative effect of adopting sfas newmil used the proceeds from the sale of the securities to prepay million of federal home loan bank fixed rate advances 
newmil incurred a prepayment fee  net of taxes  of  that has been reported in net income as an extraordinary item 
sfas has no financial impact on the results of operations for the year ended june  as newmil has no derivative financial instruments

in october newmil engaged a financial securities consultant to analyze this cmo 
based on this review newmil determined that it was highly probable that newmil would likely receive substantially less than the contractual interest on this cmo and that the cmo could experience a significant decline in market value 
newmil concluded that these and other changes in circumstances surrounding this cmo were isolated  non recurring  and highly unusual  and could not have been reasonably anticipated 
the significant increase in oreo gains in resulted from the sale of two oreo properties and the sale of the bank s interest in a partnership formed several years ago to develop an oreo property into a residential subdivision

traditional gap analysis identifies short and long term interest rate positions or exposure 
simulation analysis measures the amount of short term earnings at risk under both rising and falling rate scenarios 
newmil manages interest rate risk with the objective of maintaining a high and stable net interest margin under changing interest rate environments 
interest rate risk is measured using gap analysis  to identify short medium and long term interest rate risk positions  and simulation analysis  to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
newmil seeks to manage interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth newmil s interest rate sensitivity position  or gap position  at june   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market and savings deposits have been presented in the within month category and now account deposits have been presented in the after year category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

a liability sensitive gap implies that newmil s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
newmil simulates earnings at risk over a twelve month horizon by ramping interest rates basis points from the current rate environment 
during the year ended june  interest rates did not move basis points from their current rates 
newmil s asset liability management responds to changes in interest rates and market conditions 
the simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
newmil s policy is to ensure that the change in net income over the twelve month horizon within the basis point band will not decrease by or more 
the following table indicates that the estimated percentage change in net income over the next twelve month forecast  for june  and  horizon is within newmil s tolerance limit 
change change in in rate net income bp bp due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
capital resources during shareholders equity increased  or  to million  while book value per share increased to at june  the increase in shareholders equity resulted from earnings of  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  offset  in part  by treasury stock purchases of  dividend payments of  and a  increase in the adjustment to shareholders equity for net unrealized holding losses on securities 
in july  april  july  december and february newmil announced its intention to repurchase  of the outstanding shares     and  respectively  of it outstanding common stock in the open market and unsolicited negotiated transactions  including block purchases 
the purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset the future dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of stock options under newmil s stock option plans  and for general corporate purposes 
during newmil repurchased  shares  or  of its outstanding shares of common stock  as of july  as of june  newmil had repurchased  of its outstanding common stock  under the july plan   of its outstanding common stock  under the april  july and december plans  and  shares of its outstanding shares  under the february plan 
this represents of the total planned repurchases with total consideration of  being paid 
newmil and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements established  respectively  by the federal reserve board the frb and the fdic 
at june  newmil s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
at june  the bank s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
newmil and the bank are categorized as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier i risk based ratio of or above and a leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
dividend restrictions newmil s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to newmil 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to newmil 
under connecticut law a bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net profit for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to newmil at june  is  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on newmil by the frb 
in october newmil resumed dividend payments with the payment of a quarterly cash dividend  following a four year lapse 
in october  and newmil increased its quarterly cash dividend to  and  respectively 
in july newmil increased its quarterly dividend to 
for total dividends of per share were paid 
newmil believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers newmil s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of newmil or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by newmil will be dependent on newmil s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of newmil 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements there were no new accounting pronouncements which are expected to impact newmil at this time 
impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
