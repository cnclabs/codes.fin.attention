these savings partially offset the lower margin on domestic otc oem products from reduced sales prices under these distribution agreements 
international sales and marketing expenses declined due to the closure of our european subsidiaries and represented approximately of total international sales 
research and development remained constant for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  as we continued our efforts in several collaborative product development programs

contract research expense represented of the company s total research and development investment for the year ended march  general and administrative expenses increased significantly for the year ended march  this increase contained million of non recurring restructuring costs  including employee severance costs  legal fees and consulting costs 
without these non recurring costs  general and administrative costs would have decreased by approximately  from the year ended march liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at march  the change in cash and cash equivalents from march  was significantly impacted by the receipt of cash from the sale and leaseback of the corporate headquarter facility being offset by acquisition costs relating to the purchase of metra  the purchase of the dade behring urine test strip business  the payoff of a million real estate loan balance  the  pre payment penalty related to the loan  the acquisition and implementation of the enterprise business operating system  and the purchase of manufacturing and other equipment

the line was increased twice during the year up to million to assist with the acquisition of the urine test strip business from dade behring and the sale and leaseback of the corporate headquarters facility 
upon the completion of those two transactions  and using the proceeds from the facility sale to repay a portion of the line of credit  the outstanding balance on the line of credit was reduced to million as of december  the total available line of credit was also reduced to million at december  certain of the company s assets collateralize the line of credit 
the principal requirements for cash are for working capital  including capital equipment additions  and the costs to continue implementation of the company s new computer operating system 
cash requirements are expected to be funded by the results of operations 
the company also intends to continue searching for acquisition and technology licensing candidates 
as such  the company may need to incur additional debt  or sell additional equity  to successfully complete these acquisitions 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which the company generates cash in operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that the existing sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet operating needs during fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no
