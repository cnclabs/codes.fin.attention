item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk long term debt and interest rate market risk variable rate debt the amended credit facility permits the company to borrow up to million  a portion of which may be denominated in dutch guilders and in canadian dollars 
the variable interest rate applicable to borrowings under the amended credit facility is based on  in the case of us dollar denominated loans  the base rate referred to therein or the eurocurrency base rate referred to therein for us dollars  at the company s option  plus a specified margin 
in the event that a portion of the amended credit facility is denominated in dutch guilders  the applicable interest rate is based on the applicable eurocurrency base rate referred to therein for dutch guilders  plus a specified margin 
in the event that a portion of the amended credit facility is denominated in canadian dollars  the applicable interest rate is based on the canadian base rate referred to therein plus a specified margin of the bankers acceptance discount rate referred to therein  at the company s option 
at january   the company had borrowings under the amended credit facility of million that were subject to interest rate risk 
each hypothetical increase in interest rates would impact pretax earnings by million 
the company has an interest rate cap agreement that limits the amount of interest expense on million of this debt to a rate of 
the company does not use these products for trading purposes 
fixed rate debt the fair market value of the company s long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term fixed rate debt at january  was approximately million  which was less than its carrying value by approximately million 
a basis points decrease in the prevailing interest rates at january  would result in an increase in fair value of total fixed rate debt by approximately million 
a basis points increase in the prevailing interest rates at january  would result in a decrease in fair value of total fixed rate debt by approximately million 
fair market values were determined from quoted market prices or based on estimates made by investment bankers 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company manufactures  markets and distributes certain of its products in europe  canada  latin america and the far east 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company maintains a manufacturing or distribution presence 
if foreign currency denominated revenues are greater than costs  the translation of foreign currency denominated costs and revenues into us dollars will improve profitability when the foreign currency strengthens against the us dollar and will reduce profitability when the foreign currency weakens 
for the year ending january   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have decreased operating income by approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the company may enter into financial instruments which are limited in duration and scope to manage its exposure to fluctuations of foreign currency rates 
these instruments are used for hedging purposes and are used in connection with an underlying asset  liability  firm commitment or anticipated transaction 
charges to expense in  and related to these instruments  which are not used for trading purposes  were not significant 
raw material and commodity risks the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of most of the company s products are polypropylene and polyester fiber  polyethylene and polypropylene resin  and  to a lesser extent  rayon  tissue paper and cotton 
the prices of polypropylene and polyethylene are a function of  among other things  manufacturing capacity  demand and the price of crude oil and natural gas liquids 
historically  the prices of polyethylene and polypropylene resin have fluctuated  such as in late and early when resin prices increased by approximately 
the sharp increase was primarily due to short term interruptions in production capacity and increased demand as a result of an expanding economy 
by mid  supply had increased  thereby reducing prices 
in general  prices declined between and a significant increase in the prices of polyolefin resins that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see recent developments in this annual report on form k 
at january   the company had commitments related to raw materials of approximately million
