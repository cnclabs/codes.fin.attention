if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction
