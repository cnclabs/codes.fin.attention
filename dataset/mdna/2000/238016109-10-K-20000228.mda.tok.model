background data translation  inc  f k a data translation ii  inc  the company was incorporated in september as a wholly owned subsidiary of media inc  f k a data translation  inc  parent 
on november   parent contributed to the company substantially all of the assets and liabilities of parent s data acquisition and imaging  commercial products and networking distribution groups the contributed businesses 
on november   parent sold a substantial portion of the assets of the networking distribution business  and during the company discontinued the remainder of such business 
the company will continue to operate the data acquisition and imaging and commercial products groups 
on december  the distribution date  parent distributed to its stockholders in the form of a dividend all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company the distribution 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the financial statements of the company  which present the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for the periods presented prior to the distribution date  the historical financial statements include the assets  liabilities  income and expenses that were directly related to the contributed businesses as they were operated within parent 
in the case of assets and liabilities not specifically allocable to any particular business of parent  only those assets and liabilities owned by the company after the distribution were included in the company s separate balance sheets 
regardless of the allocation of these assets and liabilities  however  the company s statement of operations includes all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and includes an allocation of certain general corporate expenses of parent which were not directly related to the contributed businesses  including costs for corporate logistics  corporate research and development  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
these allocations were based on a number of factors including  for example  personnel  space  time and effort  and sales volume 
management believes these allocations as well as the assumptions underlying the development of the company s separate financial statements to be reasonable 
the consolidated financial statements for all periods subsequent to the distribution date reflect the results of operations  financial position  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the independent company 
the financial information included herein for periods prior to the distribution date may not  however  necessarily reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company as it would have been had the company been a separate  stand alone entity during these periods 
this is due  in part  to the historical operation of the company as an integral part of the larger parent 
following the distribution  the company became a stand alone entity with objectives and strategies separate from those of parent

sales from the company s commercial product  broadway  decreased approximately  or  from the comparable period in fiscal  which the company believes is due primarily to a decrease in the size of the company s sales force and a consolidation of the company s marketing programs

liquidity and capital resources as of november   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of  as of november during fiscal  the company generated  from operating activities  resulting from net income  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in prepaid expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the company used  for investing activities during fiscal  mainly as a result of acquisitions of property  equipment and marketable securities 
the company generated funds from financing activities of  during fiscal related to the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by the repurchase on the market of  shares of the company s common stock 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and cash flows expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements at least through the next months  although the company may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of the company s products 
there can be no assurances that additional funding  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
results of operations the following table shows certain statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal year ended november  net sales gross margin research and development expenses selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income expense and other  net income loss from operations before benefit from income taxes provision benefit from income taxes net loss certain factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements  and are based on current expectations  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with such statements include the following significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results our quarterly operating results may vary significantly for a number of reasons  including new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  changes in pricing  and the volume and timing of orders received during each quarter 
historically a significant percentage of our net sales have resulted from orders received from universities  research laboratories and government agencies 
these sales are historically slower during our third quarter as a result of seasonal vacation schedules and university shutdowns 
we have also in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancements  and such delays may occur in the future 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
additionally  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed  and operating expense levels are based primarily on internal expectations of future revenue 
as a consequence  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations  our operating results would be adversely affected 
development and introduction of new products our future success depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing high quality  cost effective products  product enhancements and services on a timely basis and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we have new product launches and upgrades to our existing products planned for fiscal year our future revenue growth will be dependent on the success of these new product launches 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
in addition  as we introduce new or enhanced products  we will have to manage successfully the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in our customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet our customers demands 
our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements  which are broadly accepted  will affect our revenues 
dependence on a few key original equipment manufacturers oems we depend on a few key original equipment manufacturer customers oems 
for example  in the year ended november   sales to our oem channel represented of our total revenue 
we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on sales to the oem channel 
therefore  the loss of any of our oems or a significant reduction in sales to these oems could substantially reduce our revenues 
ability to manage distribution channel we rely primarily on a worldwide network of independent value added resellers vars to distribute and sell our products to end users 
our resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products which are competitive with our products 
in addition  many of these vars are small organizations with limited capital resources 
there can be no assurance that the our resellers will continue to purchase our products or provide them with adequate levels of support  or that our efforts to expand its var network will be successful 
any significant failure of the preceding factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
reliance on international sales sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of our net sales for the fiscal year ended november  international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  less effective enforcement or proprietary rights  currency exchange fluctuations  generally longer collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international resellers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
our international sales are also subject to more seasonal fluctuation than domestic sales 
in this regard  the traditional summer vacation period  which occurs during our third fiscal quarter  may result in a decrease in sales  particularly in europe 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on our future international operations and consequently  on our business and operating results 
dependence on single or limited source suppliers we are dependent on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in our products 
the availability of many of these components is dependent on our ability to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements  and certain components used by us have been subject to industry wide shortages 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our inventories would be adequate to meet the our production needs during any interruption of supply 
our inability to develop alternative supply sources  if required  or a reduction or stoppage in supply  could delay product shipments until new sources of supply become available  and any such delay could adversely affect our business and operating results in any given period 
dependence on key personnel competition for employees with the skills required by us is intense in the geographic areas in which our operations are located 
we believe that our future success will depend on its continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially in research and development 
in addition  companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we cannot assure you that we will not receive such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims  regardless of their merits 
year compliance the year computer problem refers to the potential for system and processing failures of date related data as a result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date represented as as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
to date  we have not experienced any year issues with any of our internal systems or our products  and we do not expect to experience any in the future 
to date  we have not experienced any year issues related to any of our key third party suppliers and customers nor do we expect to experience any in the future 
costs associated with remediating our internal systems were not material
