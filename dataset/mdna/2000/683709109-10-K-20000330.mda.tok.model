item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increased volume was the result of continuing demand for remanufactured office systems and increased sales at ten of the company s sales offices 
the company s gsa and national accounts business also contributed to the overall results 
these results were despite the fact that the company shut down three sales offices during the company also benefited from improved retention of its sales people and the average experience level of its sales people increasing by almost one year during the company s sales strategy remains focused on a direct sales force in those markets of sufficient potential to justify the investment required 
the company also anticipates additional contributions from its newly opened sales offices in indianapolis and mexico city during gross margin 
the company s gross margin increased from million or for the year ended december  to million or for the year ended december  the company s margins improved as cost reduction activities continued to be implemented 
the company benefited from reduced warehousing space and consolidation of certain purchasing activities 
the company is now experiencing the cost savings that were expected from the operational restructuring in the prior year 
the company is continuing to analyze its procurement options with a major emphasis on determining the best  most efficient manner of procuring each item used in the manufacture and production of its product offerings 
the company has implemented a three pronged approach to product acquisition 
the company will continue to purchase product on the used furniture market when the cost of such product does not exceed certain pricing thresholds  it will purchase new product to meet demand when the purchase price is less than that of remanufacturing or manufacturing the part  and it will manufacture certain component parts where it is economically advantageous to do so 
during  the company successfully implemented a strategy of reducing the cost of its remanufactured products 
additionally  the company believes that it can continue to trim inventory levels in operating expenses 
selling expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  selling expenses  however  decreased as a percentage of sales 
the increase in selling expenses was the result of the company s efforts to grow the business during the second half of the company increased its visibility through targeted marketing programs  a new sales and marketing brochure and by becoming more visible in trade shows 
when the company opens new sales offices  it typically takes several years to generate enough sales to provide targeted returns 
new sales offices are therefore initially a drain on company profits and the company plans to carefully manage the timing of future openings of new sales offices 
as indicated earlier  the company has opened sales offices in indianapolis and mexico city in the first quarter of and expects selling expenses in relation to sales to remain somewhat higher than normal until these offices begin to fully impact revenues and gross margins 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was primarily related to decreases in corporate management and personnel expenses as the result of the company s restructuring in during  the company incurred significant litigation and severance expenses related to two former officers of the company 
this litigation was resolved in december with the company ultimately paying  in severance to the two former officers 
the company does not believe that general and administrative expenses will change materially from levels even as the company reinstitutes its geographic expansion efforts 
arbitration costs of approximately million in relate to the indemnification claims by the company against the former shareholders of tfm  which was acquired in these costs included legal fees and other related costs  including those awarded by the arbitration panel to the former tfm shareholders 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the arbitration proceeding 
other non operating income and expenses 
total other expenses decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decrease is a reduction in outstanding borrowings during the year as the company paid down its line of credit and increased collections of finance charges on past due accounts 
income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit for the year of million as opposed to no benefit being recorded in prior to  as a result of recent operating losses and the uncertainty of the realization of the potential tax benefits thereof  the company did not record potential income tax benefits of million 
during the last quarter of  the company determined that it was more probable than not that these tax benefits would be realized and reversed the valuation allowance associated with the income tax benefits 
net income loss 
the net income for the year ended december  was  versus a loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss in was principally caused by higher production costs relative to sales revenue  higher selling expenses and the operational restructuring charge 
the company benefited in from increased margins  reduced expenses and reversal of the valuation allowance on income taxes with offsetting amounts related to costs noted above related to increased litigation expenses  resulting in an increase in net income 
compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increased volume was the result of continuing demand for remanufactured office systems and increased sales at nine of the company s sales offices 
also contributing to the improved sales were shipments to the federal government which in large part offset a single major million order in during  three sales offices were closed as part of the operational restructuring recorded in the second quarter and discussed in detail below 
a key element of the company s sales strategy during the second half of was the return to a focus on the company s core remanufacturing strategy which includes the remanufacture of herman miller and haworth work stations 
operational restructuring 
the company recorded a charge of  in the second quarter of the restructuring charge of  recognized the costs related to three important strategic initiatives a return to a focus on the core remanufacturing business  streamlining and consolidation of warehouse operations  and consolidation of existing sales offices and reductions in sales training staff 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  the company refocused on producing remanufactured product  reduced excess warehouse space  divested certain assets associated with the new work station manufacturing capabilities  and streamlined operations and reduced sales and administrative staffing by approximately people 
the restructuring charge recorded included approximately  for lease termination costs   for asset writedowns  and  for other costs associated with streamlining operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company disposed of all fixed assets included in the restructuring and incurred substantially all of the severance and lease termination costs associated with the restructuring plan 
under the restructuring plan  the company reduced its warehousing capacity in dallas  atlanta  cincinnati and richmond as well as at its lansing  michigan facility 
the plan called for the reduction of  square feet of leased warehouse space 
additionally  the company divested certain metal working equipment and wrote off its investment in new software acquired to support new furniture manufacturing operations 
this supported the company s return to its focus on remanufacturing 
as part of the sales office restructuring program implemented at the end of the second quarter of  the company closed its sales offices in dallas  charlotte and baltimore and reduced sales training staff in certain other markets 
the sales offices closed contributed less than  in sales during the thrust of this program was to reduce the number of low production sales offices and personnel 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased from million or for the year ended december  to million or for the year ended december  this was caused by increased overhead costs during the early part of as well as higher material costs and lower productivity earlier in the year 
during the first half of  the company s gross margin percentage was 
the gross margin percentage improved to in the second half of the effect of the restructuring actions  improved manufacturing productivity and other cost reduction activities resulted in the improved margins 
in  the company experienced less price discounting pressure than in operating expenses 
selling expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  selling expenses also increased as a percentage of sales 
the increase in selling expenses was caused by the company s efforts in early to increase the size of its sales force and branch office network 
as noted previously  the company restructured its sales efforts at the end of the second quarter of to bring these costs more in line with expected revenue trends and provide a more solid base for future growth 
when the company opens new sales offices  it typically takes several years to generate enough sales to provide targeted returns 
new sales offices are therefore initially a drain on company profits and the company plans to carefully manage the timing of future openings of new sales offices 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was primarily related to increases in corporate management and personnel expenses during the early part of during  the company incurred significant expenses related to significant changes in senior management 
in  the company dedicated significant resources to the evaluation of potential business combinations and acquisitions that were ultimately determined not to be good strategic fits for the company 
the company significantly reduced these expenses in the latter part of  with second half expenses down  from the first half of other non operating income and expenses 
total other income and expense decreased from income of  for the year ended december  to expense of  for the year ended december  the primary reasons were that the company drew down its entire cash balance and borrowed on its line of credit during bank debt declined from million at the end of the second quarter of to million by year end 
income taxes 
the company recorded no tax benefit for as opposed to a benefit of  in as a result of recent operating losses and the uncertainty of the realization of the potential tax benefits thereof  the company did not record potential income tax benefits of million for the deferred income tax asset of million at december  was offset by a valuation allowance 
net loss 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million versus a loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss was principally caused by higher production costs relative to sales revenue  higher selling expenses and the operational restructuring charge 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operations was  for the year ended december  versus cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operations is due primarily to the amounts spent on certain legal proceedings associated with two former officers of the company 
inventory and receivables also increased during the company believes that it will make progress in in reducing inventory levels 
the company s increase in accounts receivable was primarily a function of higher fourth quarter sales 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in versus 
million in the increase in investing activities was principally the result of the million payment to the former officers of the company relating to the tfm acquisition with the remaining increase being attributable to modernization of the company s truck fleet to reduce maintenance and other associated costs 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in versus net cash used in financing activities of  in during  the company repurchased a net  of stock from the company s founder and borrowed money to fund fixed asset acquisitions and payments to former officers 
in  the company paid down amounts on its line of credit as inventory levels decreased 
expected future cash flows 
the company anticipates that current cash balances plus cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit will be adequate to fund its short term and long term capital needs 
impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of efforts to address the year issue and the readiness of the company s computer systems 
in  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of its planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company spent less than  in testing and remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
seasonality  impact of inflation and market risk the company has no discernable pattern of seasonality 
because the company recognizes revenues upon shipment and typically ships work stations within three weeks of an order  a substantial portion of the company s revenues in each quarter results from orders placed by customers during that quarter 
as a result  the company s results may vary from quarter to quarter 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurances that the company s business will not be affected in the future by inflation 
the company is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its revolving line of credit arrangement  however  the company s exposure is not considered material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not use derivatives 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and description of the company s business set forth in part i  item of this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by phrases such as the company expects or words of similar effect 
in addition  from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the following important factors  among other things  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for fiscal year and any interim period to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company assumes no duty to update any of the statements in this report 
potential limitations on future growth 
the company has experienced significant growth since it commenced operations in the company s continued growth will be dependent in part on the company s ability to manage growth effectively  including the improvement of the company s financial and management information systems  the expansion of the company s manufacturing and remanufacturing operations and the recruitment and retention of executive staff and key employees 
the company also will be required to manage working capital and generate cash flow from operations to meet the needs of an expanding business 
there can be no assurances that the company s future growth will not be limited by insufficient cash flow or the lack of adequate financing required to fund such growth 
impact of customer preferences and technological advances on sales 
certain potential customers may prefer new work stations to the company s remanufactured work stations due to various factors  including the more developed and better financed marketing efforts of new work station manufacturers and such potential customers reluctance to purchase remanufactured products because of image  perceived questions of quality or other factors 
in addition  technological advances are frequently incorporated into new work stations by the leading manufacturers  particularly with respect to electrical circuits necessary for more advanced computer and telecommunications features 
although the company has the ability to incorporate these technological advances in its remanufactured work stations  any such incorporation may increase remanufacturing costs and may reduce the price advantage of remanufactured work stations over newly manufactured work stations 
dependence upon supply of work stations and component parts 
the company presently purchases only used herman miller and haworth work stations in its remanufacturing operations 
the company does not have any binding agreements relating to the purchase of used herman miller or haworth work stations for remanufacturing and generally purchases such used work stations from end users  brokers and dealers through competitive bids or directly negotiated transactions 
although the company in the past has not experienced a shortage of used work stations at competitive prices  the success of the company in the future will depend in part upon its continued ability to obtain herman miller  haworth and other manufacturers used work stations for remanufacturing in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices 
while the company believes that the availability of used work stations for remanufacturing will increase as the installed base of work stations increases and ages  there may be periods of tight supply as the demand for used work stations increases which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and profitability 
the company also purchases new and used component parts for use in the remanufacture of work stations 
although the company can manufacture certain of the component parts needed to remanufacture work stations  there can be no assurances that shortages of certain component parts or higher prices for such parts will not occur in the future 
an inability to produce or purchase necessary component parts in adequate quantities and at competitive prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on sales office profitability 
the company depends heavily on its sales offices to provide revenue growth 
the company has opened two new offices in the company s experience indicates that it takes several years for a sales office to develop adequate sales volumes to generate expected returns 
until that time  the company s selling expenses increase faster than the gross profit generated from those sales 
an inability to increase revenues of new sales offices to levels that would offset the continuing expenses of such sales offices may adversely affect the profitability of the company s business 
no assurance of expansion of product lines and business 
the company has concentrated its business on remanufacturing work stations manufactured by herman miller and haworth 
the company is now expanding its product line to include steelcase work stations 
the company has limited experience in remanufacturing work stations of manufacturers other than herman miller and haworth 
due to the differences in and lack of interchangeability of the various work stations and certain component parts produced by the major manufacturers  the company s expansion of its product line will require additional training of production personnel  the establishment of additional sources of supply of used work stations and component parts and  in some cases  the establishment of different remanufacturing processes 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to expand successfully its product line or maintain its gross margins 
dependence upon primary remanufacturing facilities 
the company primarily remanufactures herman miller work stations at one facility in richmond  virginia  and haworth work stations at one facility in lansing  michigan 
although the company presently maintains  of business interruption insurance on the richmond facility and  of such insurance on the lansing facility  a lengthy interruption of its remanufacturing operations at the richmond or lansing facilities would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
tax matters associated with prior s corporation status 
until may   the company had elected to be taxed under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of  as amended  as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes since its incorporation in unlike a regular or c corporation  an s corporation is generally not subject to income tax at the corporate level  instead  the s corporation s income is taxed on the personal income tax returns of its shareholders 
the company s status as an s corporation was terminated upon commencement of its initial public offering 
if the company s s corporation status were denied for any periods prior to this termination by reason of a failure to satisfy the s corporation election or eligibility requirements of the code  the company would be subject to tax on its income as if it were a c corporation for these periods 
the payment of any such tax could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations if the full amount thereof is not reimbursed by those individuals who were shareholders of the company prior to the initial public offering 
such shareholders have agreed to pay their pro rata share of any such tax and any applicable interest  penalties and expenses in the event that the company s s corporation status is denied for any taxable periods up to the date of the termination of the company s s corporation status on may  potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
because the company recognizes revenues upon shipment and typically ships work stations within three weeks of an order  a substantial portion of the company s revenue in each quarter results from orders placed by customers in that quarter 
accordingly  quarterly revenue levels are subject to substantial fluctuations and are often difficult to predict 
fluctuations in operating results could result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results will be adversely affected 
competition 
competition in the work station segment of the office furniture industry is intense 
the company competes with many other companies in the sale of its new and remanufactured products as well as in the purchase of as is work stations and component parts for use in the company s remanufactured work stations 
in the sale of remanufactured work stations  the company competes with manufacturers of new work stations and their remanufacturing subsidiaries  other independent remanufacturers and dealers of as is work stations 
in the purchase of used work stations that are the primary source of the company s supply for its remanufacturing operations  the company competes with the manufacturers of new work stations and their remanufacturing subsidiaries  both of which sometimes provide a trade in allowance to purchasers of their products  other independent remanufacturers and work station brokers and dealers 
sales of the company s remanufactured work stations depend on maintaining a successful balance between price and quality so that its work stations are positioned in the marketplace to provide a product that is i comparable or superior in quality  design and appearance to higher cost new work stations and ii superior in quality  features and appearance to lower cost as is work stations 
failure by the company to maintain this balance due to increased competition in either the purchase or sale of work stations could adversely affect the company s business 
additionally  certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales and other resources than the company 
environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in its manufacturing processes 
regulations implementing the federal clean air act  as amended in  may require reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants  including certain emissions resulting from the company s use of paints and solvents in the remanufacturing process 
as a result  the company may be required to install emission controls or to institute changes in its remanufacturing processes in order to comply with these reduced emission standards 
there can be no assurance that these and other changes in environmental regulations in the future will not result in the need for capital expenditures or otherwise impose financial burdens on the company 
further  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its operations 
any failure by the company to obtain required permits for  control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended 
such liability or suspension of manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risk of patent infringement claims 
newly manufactured work stations contain numerous patented component parts 
although the company is not aware of any existing or threatened patent infringement claims asserted against it and does not believe that its remanufacturing of work stations infringes the proprietary rights of any third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against the company 
in addition  the company manufactures or purchases certain new and used component parts included in its remanufactured work stations 
to the extent that such activities involve purchasing or manufacturing component parts similar to patented component parts  the company could become subject to claims of patent infringement if the manufacture or use of such component parts infringed the proprietary rights of third parties 
in addition  the existence of third party proprietary rights could limit the company s ability to produce or use certain component parts 
damages for violation of third party proprietary rights could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims  the company would incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof
