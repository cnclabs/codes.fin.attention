in addition  we exchanged company stock options for all of the outstanding stock options under the former vantis employee stock plans with a calculated black scholes value of million 
our aggregate purchase price for vantis was million 
the purchase was financed using a combination of cash reserves and a new credit facility that was replaced with convertible notes in november see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on an independent appraisal and management estimates 
in process research development ipr d costs were appraised at million at the acquisition date using a methodology consistent with current views of the staff of the sec 
these ipr d costs were charged to operations on the acquisition date 
remaining intangible asset costs of million at the acquisition date are being amortized to operations over five years using the straight line method 
the purchase price and related allocation are subject to further refinement and change over the period covering one year from the acquisition date 
we have taken certain actions to integrate the vantis operations and  in certain instances  to consolidate duplicative operations 
accrued exit costs related to vantis were recorded as an adjustment to the fair value of net assets in the purchase price allocation 
accrued exit costs include million related to vantis office closures  million related to separation benefits for vantis employees and million in other exit costs primarily relating to the termination of vantis foreign distributors 
separation benefits relate primarily to twenty vantis senior managers 
at december   five employees from this group had terminated 
as of december   an additional vantis employees had terminated for other merger related reasons 
payments of approximately  have been charged to this accrued liability 
if these employees had not terminated  substantially all of the related costs would have been charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
charges to other exit cost accrued liabilities were not significant for the period from june  through december  there have been no non cash charges or credits to accrued exit costs 
these accruals are based upon our current estimates and are in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
revenue 
revenue was million in fiscal period  an increase of from fiscal year fiscal year revenue of million represented a decrease of from the million recorded in fiscal year in addition to our acquisition of vantis  the revenue increase in fiscal period as compared to fiscal year was attributable to increased sales of isp products and recovering demand from asia 
fiscal year revenue as compared to fiscal was negatively impacted by a decline in demand from asia due to the economic crisis in that region 
furthermore  revenue in all geographies was negatively impacted by a decline in demand for our non isp product families 
our sales by geographic area were as follows nine months year ended ended dec 
 mar 
 mar 
 in thousands united states    export sales europe    asia    other    revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for fiscal period  for fiscal year and for fiscal year we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
the average selling price of our products decreased slightly in fiscal period as compared to fiscal year the average selling price of our products was flat in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in fiscal period was due primarily to changes in product mix 
although selling prices of mature products generally decline over time  this decline is at times offset by higher selling prices of new products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
gross margin 
our gross margin was for fiscal period  for fiscal year and for fiscal year the gross margin decline in fiscal period as compared to fiscal year is attributable to our acquisition of vantis on june  the decline was partially offset by an improvement in product mix and reductions in our manufacturing costs 
the improvement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an improvement in product mix and reductions in our manufacturing costs 
reductions in manufacturing costs resulted primarily from yield improvements  migration of products to more advanced technologies and smaller die sizes  and wafer price reductions 
research and development 
research and development expense was million in fiscal period  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for fiscal period  in addition to our acquisition of vantis  spending increases resulted primarily from the increased development of new products 
spending increases in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from the increased development of new products 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership in our existing product families and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal period  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in the fiscal period as opposed to fiscal year was primarily due to our vantis acquisition and to a lesser extent attributable to increased variable costs associated with higher revenue levels 
the decrease in fiscal year expense as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to decreased variable costs associated with lower revenue levels 
in process research and development 
on june   we bought from amd all of the outstanding capital stock of vantis corporation for approximately million in cash in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
including liabilities assumed and purchase accounting reserves established  the total purchase cost was million  of which million was allocated to intangible assets 
a portion of the intangible asset value was in process research and development  or ipr d  with a value of approximately million which was charged to expense on the acquisition date as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the remaining million of intangible asset value consisting of existing technology  assembled workforce  customer lists  patents  trademarks and goodwill  is being amortized to operations over years using the straight line method 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition was million for fiscal period the estimated weighted average useful life of the intangible assets for current technology  assembled workforce  customer lists  trademarks  patents and residual goodwill  created as a result of the acquisition  is approximately five years 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was million for fiscal period  a million decrease as compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to interest expense of approximately million from acquisition related debt and reduced interest income resulting from lower cash and investment balances in conjunction with the acquisition 
other income expense  net  was approximately flat for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  as higher cash and investment balances were offset by lower interest rates for invested balances  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year 
provision for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal period was of the loss before benefit for income taxes 
this reflects the estimated rate at which income taxes would be recoverable if a loss tax return were filed 
the loss before benefit for income taxes is attributable to the ipr d charge during the period of approximately million and intangible asset amortization of million 
if these charges were not present  we would have had taxable income and an income tax rate of approximately 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal year and for fiscal year the rate change in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due primarily to changes in the proportion of tax exempt interest income included in our overall net income 
the fiscal rate was also favorably impacted by reduced state taxes resulting from the increased realization of tax credits 
extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
the extraordinary item  net of income taxes  represents the writeoff of unamortized loan fees related to the million term loan repaid in conjunction with the financing of our acquisition of vantis 
factors affecting future results our wafer supply could be interrupted or reduced and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale we do not manufacture finished silicon wafers 
currently all of our silicon wafers are manufactured by seiko epson in japan  amd in the united states and the umc group  a group of affiliated companies  in taiwan 
if seiko epson  through its us affiliate epson electronics america  amd or the umc group significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining wafers and in securing supply commitments from our foundries 
at present  we anticipate that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if seiko epson  epson electronics america  amd or the umc group reduces our supply commitment or increases our wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be adversely affected 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be adversely affected by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply 
additionally  a future disruption of seiko epson s  amd s or the umc group s foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our wafer supply and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if our foundry partners experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale we depend on our foundries to deliver reliable silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer yield problems and delivery delays in the past 
if our foundries are unable to produce silicon wafers that meet our specifications  with acceptable yields  for a prolonged period  our operating results could be adversely affected 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from products based on a specialized silicon wafer manufacturing process technology called e cmos 
the reliable manufacture of high performance e cmos semiconductor wafers is a complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication process  and effective cooperation between the wafer supplier and the circuit designer 
as a result  our foundries may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when manufacturing our silicon wafers 
we may be unsuccessful in defining  developing or selling new products required to maintain or expand our business as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to introduce new or improved products that meet customer needs while achieving acceptable margins 
if we fail to introduce these new products in a timely manner or these products fail to achieve market acceptance  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
the introduction of new products in a dynamic market environment presents significant business challenges 
product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of product sales 
the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long term market demand and future technology developments 
our future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new proprietary isp product families and the continued market acceptance of our proprietary software development tools 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  and the quality and reliability of the product 
if  due to these or other factors  our new products do not achieve market acceptance  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our products may not be competitive if we are unsuccessful in migrating our manufacturing processes to more advanced technologies in order to develop new products and maintain the competitiveness of existing products  we need to migrate to more advanced wafer manufacturing processes that utilize larger wafer sizes and smaller device geometries 
we may also utilize additional foundries 
since we depend upon foundries to provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may experience delays in the availability of advanced wafer manufacturing process technologies at existing or new wafer fabrication facilities 
as a result  volume production of our advanced e cmos process technologies at the new fabs of seiko epson  the umc group or future foundries may not be achieved 
this could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if our assembly and test subcontractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of finished products available for sale we rely on subcontractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced quality and yield problems in the past 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future  there could be an adverse effect on our operating results 
the majority of our revenue is derived from semiconductor devices assembled in advanced packages 
the assembly of advanced packages is a complex process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the absence of defects in lead frames used to attach semiconductor devices to the package  the elimination of raw material impurities and errors in each step of the process  and effective cooperation between the assembly subcontractor and the device manufacturer 
as a result  our subcontractors may experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels when assembling and testing our semiconductor devices 
we may experience unexpected difficulties due to the integration of vantis we acquired vantis on june   and at present have completed the integration of this business with our other operations 
as a result of this acquisition and subsequent integration  we may incur unexpected disruptions to our ongoing business 
these disruptions may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
further  the following specific factors may adversely affect our ability to successfully operate the business of vantis we may experience unexpected losses of key employees or customers  we may experience unexpected costs and discover unexpected liabilities  we may not achieve historical levels of revenue growth  cost reduction and profitability improvement  and we may not be able to coordinate our new product and process development in a way which enables us to bring new technologies to the market in a timely manner 
in addition  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we entered into arrangements with vantis former parent  amd  for amd to provide certain manufacturing support and services 
in the event amd fails to provide these services  or provides such services at a level of quality and timeliness inconsistent with the historical delivery of such services  our ability to successfully operate vantis will be severely hampered and our business may suffer 
deterioration of conditions in asia may disrupt our existing supply arrangements and result in a shortage of finished products available for sale two of our three silicon wafer suppliers operate fabs located in asia 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors located in hong kong  malaysia  the philippines  south korea  taiwan and thailand 
a prolonged interruption in our supply from any of these subcontractors could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
although we have not experienced significant supply interruptions  the economic  financial  social and political situation in asia has in the past been volatile 
financial difficulties  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
our wafer purchases from seiko epson are denominated in japanese yen 
the value of the dollar with respect to the yen has fluctuated in the past and may not remain stable in the future 
future substantial deterioration of dollar yen exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
export sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties our export sales are affected by unique risks frequently associated with foreign economies including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the export of technology  political instability  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  interruptions in air transportation  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
for example  our export sales have in the past been affected by regional economic crises 
significant changes in the economic climate in the foreign countries where we derive our export sales could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase revenue and profit levels during future industry downturns the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  to a greater extent than other less dynamic or less technology driven industries 
in the past  our financial performance has been negatively affected by significant downturns in the semiconductor industry as a result of the cyclical nature of the demand for the products of semiconductor customers  general reductions in inventory levels by customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
if these or other conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future  there could be an adverse effect on our operating results 
our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
as a result of industry conditions and the following specific factors  our quarterly operating results are more likely to fluctuate and are more difficult to predict than a typical non technology company of our size and maturity general economic conditions in the countries where we sell our products  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the new fabs of seiko epson and the umc group or at another foundry  changes in manufacturing yields  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates or tax rates  and the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
as a result of these factors  our past financial results are not necessarily a good predictor of our future results 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase as our market expands 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our products and technology or have developed similar products 
we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products and solutions based on alternative technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
we also may experience significant competition from foreign companies in the future 
we may fail to retain or attract the specialized technical and management personnel required to successfully operate our business to a greater degree than most non technology companies or larger technology companies  our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and management personnel 
as a mid sized company  we are particularly dependent on a relatively small group of key employees 
competition for skilled technical and management employees is intense within our industry 
as a result  we may not be able to retain our existing key technical and management personnel 
in addition  we may not be able to attract additional qualified employees in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unable to hire new qualified employees  our operating results could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
however  we may fail to adequately protect this technology 
as a result  we may lose our competitive position or face significant expense to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop similar technology independently 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue their intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation we may utilize substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we may also be subject to future intellectual property claims or judgements 
if these were to occur  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms or without our operating results being adversely affected 
year compliance during we completed our planned year compliance activities with respect to our products  internal systems  software  equipment and facilities 
in aggregate we spent approximately million to fund year compliance activities and related system and software upgrades 
to date  we have not encountered any material year problems with respect to our products  internal systems  software  equipment and facilities nor have we encountered any vendor supply disruptions related to year problems 
our stock price may continue to experience large short term fluctuations in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe and have left investors little time to react 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by other companies 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and march  the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of january  and april   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
further  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company has international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  the majority of the company s silicon wafer purchases are denominated in japanese yen 
the company is therefore subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to mitigate rate exposure with respect to yen denominated wafer purchases  the company maintains yen denominated bank accounts and bills its japanese customers in yen 
the yen bank deposits are utilized to hedge yen denominated wafer purchases against specific and firm wafer purchases 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at january  and april   the effect on the company s consolidated financial statements would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and short term investments  a decrease of million from the balance of million at march  the decrease was due to use of cash for our acquisition of vantis partially offset by cash generated from operations and exercises of stock options 
working capital decreased million to million at december  from million at march  this decrease in working capital was primarily a result of use of cash for our acquisition 
during the nine months of fiscal period  we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from our operating activities compared with million during the twelve months of fiscal year in addition to the cash and cash equivalents generated  other changes in assets and liabilities are described below 
accounts receivable at december  increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at march  this increase was primarily due to increased product shipments and revenue levels related to our acquisition 
inventories increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at march  primarily due to increased production in response to higher revenue levels and the inclusion of inventories related to our acquisition 
current deferred income taxes increased million  or  as compared to the balance at march  primarily due to the increase in deferred income for sales to distributors which is recognized currently for income tax purposes  and to a lesser extent the timing of deductions for certain expenses and allowances 
net property and equipment increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at march  primarily due to acquired assets 
long term deferred income taxes increased million versus the balance at march  and primarily represent future income tax benefits to be derived from the amortization for income tax purposes of the ipr d charges which were written off in the first quarter of fiscal period for financial reporting purposes and the amortization of other intangible assets for tax purposes 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at march  due primarily to the inclusion of liabilities related to our acquisition 
accrued payroll obligations increased by million  or as compared to the balance at march   due primarily to the inclusion of liabilities related to our acquisition 
the million  or increase in income taxes payable as compared to the balance at march  is primarily attributable to the timing of tax deductions and payments 
deferred income increased by million  or  as compared to the balance at march   due primarily to increased billings to distributors associated with our acquisition 
on october   we issued million in convertible subordinated notes due on november  these notes require that we pay interest semi annually on may and november holders of these notes may convert them into shares of our common stock at any time on or before november   at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain events 
beginning on november  and ending on october   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price of of the principal amount 
in the subsequent three twelve month periods  the redemption price declines to  and of principal  respectively 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had million of other liabilities 
issuance costs relative to the convertible subordinated notes are included in other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the lives of the notes 
accumulated amortization amounted to approximately  at december  on june   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and abn amro bank nv abn amro as administrative agent for the lender group 
the credit agreement consisted of two credit facilities a million unsecured revolving credit facility revolver  and a million unsecured reducing term loan term loan  both expiring and due on june  on june   we borrowed million under the term loan and approximately million under the revolver 
the credit facilities allowed for borrowings at adjustable rates with interest payments due quarterly 
the million revolver was repaid in full during the third calendar quarter of in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  we repaid the million term loan in full during the fourth calendar quarter of fiscal remaining unamortized loan fees at the time of repayment  aggregating approximately million million net of income taxes or a charge of for basic and diluted earnings per share  were written off and are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for fiscal period  and fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for the fiscal year ending december  in march  we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and its affiliated us distributor  epson electronics america  under which we agreed to advance approximately million  payable upon completion of specific milestones  to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron wafer manufacturing facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through epson electronics america  pursuant to purchase agreements with epson electronics america 
we also have an option under this agreement to advance seiko epson an additional million for additional wafer supply under similar terms 
the first payment pursuant to this agreement  approximately million  was made during fiscal during fiscal  we made two additional payments aggregating approximately million 
the balance of the advance payment is currently anticipated to be made in two future installments 
we entered into a series of agreements with umc  in september pursuant to which we agreed to join umc and several other companies to form a separate taiwanese company  uicc  for the purpose of building and operating an advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility in taiwan 
under the terms of the agreements  we invested approximately million for an approximate equity interest in uicc and the right to receive a percentage of the facility s wafer production at market prices 
in october  we entered into an agreement with utek  a public taiwanese company in the wafer foundry business that became affiliated with the umc group in  pursuant to which we agreed to make a series of equity investments in utek under specific terms 
in exchange for these investments we received the right to purchase a percentage of utek s wafer production 
under this agreement  we invested approximately million in three separate installments 
in june  the board of directors of uicc and board of directors of umc voted in favor of merging uicc into umc 
these mergers became effective on january  after the mergers we own approximately million shares of umc common stock and have retained our capacity rights 
due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of our umc shares may not be sold until july these regulatory restrictions will gradually expire between july and january in june  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we entered into a series of agreements with amd to support the continuing operations of vantis 
amd has agreed to provide us with finished silicon wafers through september in quantities based either on a rolling six month or an annual forecast 
we have committed to buy certain minimum quantities of wafers and amd has committed to supply certain quantities of wafers during this period 
wafers for our products are manufactured in the united states at multiple amd wafer fabrication facilities 
prices for these wafers will be reviewed and adjusted periodically 
we believe that our existing liquid resources  expected cash generated from operations and existing credit facilities combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
in an effort to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution
