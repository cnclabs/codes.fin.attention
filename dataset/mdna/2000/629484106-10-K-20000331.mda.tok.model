item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company s results of operations are derived from its three main segments which include the domestic insurance companies  the domestic agencies and syndicate the company s domestic insurance companies participate in pools of insurance covering ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and non marine liability insurance managed by mmo and affiliates 
effective january   the company s participation in the pools increased to 
syndicate underwrites a book of ocean marine insurance 
the following represents the company s net premiums written and net premiums earned for each of the past three years 
nymagic net premiums written by line of business year ended december  in thousands ocean marine a    inland marine aircraft   other liability    other  total    nymagic net premiums earned by line of business year ended december  in thousands ocean marine b    inland marine aircraft    other liability    other  total    a includes net premiums written from syndicate of  and  for and  respectively 
b includes net premiums earned from syndicate of  and  for and  respectively 
unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aviation and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and the anticipation of positive underwriting results 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include both brokerage commissions and premium taxes which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
such costs have generally changed in proportion with changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
as compared to net income for the year ended december   was  or per diluted share compared with the year ended december   net income of  or per diluted share 
operating income  which excludes the effects of realized investment gains after taxes  was  or 
per share  for the year ended december   versus  or per share  for the prior year 
for the year ended december   net premiums earned were  as compared with  for the amount included approximately million relating to two transactions involving assumptions of ocean marine and casualty business 
excluding these one time items  net premiums earned for the year ended december  would have increased 
ocean marine net premiums earned increased in by  excluding one time items  and is largely attributable to business derived from the syndicate segment 
approximately million in net premiums earned  mostly ocean marine hull  was produced by syndicate in  its first full year of operations  when compared to  excluding one time items  in net premiums earned from the domestic insurance companies segment were down as competition generally remained intense in and adversely affected ocean marine premium rates as well as premium renewals 
the outlook for indicates that pricing pressures will remain as the over capacity within this market still exists 
syndicate will also continue to write at a cautious pace 
aviation gross premium written grew in to million as a result of rate increases obtained in on accounts with poor loss records as well as increases in overall line size per account 
as the underwriting climate for gross premiums has remained soft for several years in the aviation line  the company maintained an adequate level of reinsurance to protect its exposure to any one loss 
as a result  after excess of loss and quota share reinsurance  the company s net writings amounted to million in the company expects premiums to increase in due in part to the trend in premium rates which occurred in the latter half of the other liability line decreased in  excluding one time items  when compared to due to the effects of competitive pricing as well as a decline in premium production 
the company expects the casualty market to remain competitive in with premiums likely to decline further 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned were for the year ended december   as compared to  excluding one time items  for the same period of the prior year 
the domestic insurance subsidiaries recorded higher loss ratios in the aviation line of business in due to increases in both the frequency and severity of losses 
in addition  the company s ocean marine line recorded higher loss ratios in  primarily attributable to the loss experience produced from our syndicate segment 
syndicate experienced a relatively high frequency of marine hull claims in commission and other income increased substantially in when compared to and reflected larger profit commissions on the reinsurance of our ocean marine and aviation lines from our domestic insurance agency segment 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in loan principal outstanding 
net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by from the level of net investment income achieved in contributing to the decline were lower overall investment yields and a reduction in invested assets brought about by the payments of a large number of losses on a gross basis in the aviation and umbrella lines of business 
policy acquisition expenses as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the prior year 
the increase in the ratio is due in large part to the two transactions involving assumptions of premiums in absent such business  the ratio would have been approximately for the year ended december general and administrative expenses decreased by in from the prior year s amounts included certain non recurring expenses incurred in connection with the assumption of premiums and the formation of syndicate in addition  larger expenses were recorded for two employee benefit plans in within the domestic insurance agencies 
realized investment gains of  for the year ended december  result in large part from the sale of appreciated equity securities 
in addition  sales resulted from monitoring the company s overall exposure to equity securities to be in accordance with its investment guidelines 
total investments decreased to million at december  primarily due to reductions in unrealized gains on investments as a result of rising interest rates and reductions in the investment portfolio to fund payments of aviation and umbrella losses on a gross basis 
these payments contributed to cash flow used in operations in of million 
the company maintains an adequate level of reinsurance to prevent any one loss from significantly affecting net income 
however  timing differences between the payment of gross losses by the company and cash collections received from reinsurers may adversely impact cash flow in any one period 
reinsurance receivables increased by to million as of december  increases in gross severity losses in the aviation  umbrella and ocean marine lines  of which substantial amounts were ceded under various reinsurance agreements  accounted for the increase 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased to million from million in and principally reflects the adverse impact of higher interest rates in on the company s market value of its fixed income portfolio 
as compared to net income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
diluted earnings per share decreased to in as compared to in operating income  which excludes realized investment gains  was million in compared to million in operating earnings per share on a diluted basis was in compared with in the company s net premiums earned decreased to million in as compared to million in premiums earned in reflected very competitive markets across all lines of business  premiums from syndicate and the effects of two transactions involving the assumption of premiums 
ocean marine earned premiums increased by in compared to the increase resulted from a reinsurance transaction involving a one time assumption of approximately million of premiums that emanated from syndicate  which commenced operations in syndicate contributed an additional million in gross direct ocean marine writings in the domestic insurance companies reported a decrease in earned premiums as competition remained intense and adversely affected premium rates 
collectively  other liability and other premiums earned were million in compared to million in the increase resulted from the second reinsurance transaction in that included a one time assumption of approximately million of miscellaneous casualty net premiums 
excluding the effect of this transaction  premiums earned would have decreased approximately in primarily as a result of the soft casualty market which led to a decline in premium production 
the aviation line of business was most affected by the competitive market  with gross writings down by  and coupled with the purchase of additional reinsurance protection resulted in premiums earned decreasing to million in compared with million in obtaining additional reinsurance protection is consistent with the company s strategy of minimizing risk and preserving capital as the underwriting climate for gross premiums remained soft in in addition  large aviation gross losses resulted in additional reinsurance reinstatement costs of approximately million that further contributed to the decline in premiums 
inland marine gross premium writings increased to million in due in large part to writing policies that are ancillary to its ocean marine risks 
earned premiums were negative due to reinsurance costs for catastrophe protection  reinstatement costs  and quota share reinsurance which collectively amounted to approximately million 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the ocean marine loss ratio for syndicate s assumption of premiums in was approximately and had the effect of increasing the overall loss ratio significantly 
absent such business  the ocean marine loss ratio would have been approximately as compared to for the prior year 
the domestic insurance companies recorded favorable net loss experience in the company s core ocean marine line largely due to lower retention levels per loss 
the other liability loss ratio increased to from in the assumption of miscellaneous net casualty premiums in was subsequently commuted in the fourth quarter of at a loss ratio of 
excluding this business  the loss ratio would have been approximately 
adverse development from prior year losses contributed to the increase 
an improvement in the frequency of losses and favorable net loss development contributed to a lower loss ratio in the aviation line in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the prior year 
the reduction in the ratio is due to the two transactions involving an assumption of premiums in excluding the effect of such business  the ratio would have been approximately for this ratio approximates the ocean marine line of business ratio as those premiums represent a larger percentage of total premiums in than in net investment income in decreased by to million from million in as a result of a decrease in investment yield in the company s fixed maturity portfolio caused by additional purchases of tax exempt securities and lower overall interest rates 
although investment yield was lower in  syndicate s operations contributed to a larger average invested asset base in commission income in was  as compared to  for the prior year included larger profit commissions from reinsurance transactions in the aviation and ocean marine lines of business 
general and administrative expenses increased by in over the increase included operating expenses from syndicate also  certain one time expenses were incurred in connection with the assumption of premiums and the formation of syndicate lastly  contributing to the overall increase were expenses associated with two employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors in interest expense decreased for the year ended december  to million primarily as a result of a decrease in average loan principal outstanding 
the company was able to realize investment gains of million in mainly as a result of the sale of appreciated equity securities in the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to for taxable income was greater in as a result of larger underwriting profits and realized investment gains 
the decrease in the effective rate was also due to increased tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax income in liquidity and capital resources the company monitors cash and short term investments in order to have an adequate level of funds available to satisfy claims and expenses as they become due

the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income and maturing or liquidating investments 
historically  cash flows provided by operating activities were used in investing and financing activities 
in cash inflows increased as premium rates were higher in the ocean marine and aviation lines 
cash flows were used in operating activities in and as further declines in premium rates  increases in ceded reinsurance premium costs and increases in gross severity claims negatively affected cash flows from operations 
the company s maturing book of casualty business also adversely affected cash flows 
investing and financing activities occurred as a result of utilizing the company s revolving credit agreement and unsecured credit facility 
additional borrowings of approximately  and  were made in and  respectively  to assist in the payment of gross losses of the company and to repurchase the company s common stock 
repayments under the company s existing loan were made at  per quarter through december  and borrowings under the unsecured credit facility were fully repaid after collecting recoverables due from reinsurers on such losses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to reasonably possible changes in the fair value of financial instruments which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the largest market risk to the company relates to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
this risk is considered when developing benchmarks for evaluating the company s portfolio 
such benchmarks also consider the overall duration of the company s loss reserves 
through the matching of cash flows from future maturing investments and the ultimate payout pattern of loss reserves  the company believes it can minimize the effect of interest rate risk 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
taxables also include mortgage backed securities that have prepayment features which may cause actual cash flows to differ from those based on maturity date 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempt average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
the company s investment guidelines are conservatively designed and prevent the investment in securities below an a rating 
overall  the company has maintained fixed maturities with an average credit quality rating of aa as of december  the company s exposure to credit risk is considered minimal 
foreign currency risk includes exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on the market value and interest income of foreign denominated investments 
syndicate operations maintain investments in british pounds sterling with a us equivalent of million to the extent business is derived from transactions in such currency 
the investment of cash flows from business written in pounds sterling in securities of the same foreign currency  should ultimately mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to british pounds sterling 
equity risk includes the potential loss from changes in the fair value of equity securities 
the company s equity securities are traded on major stock exchanges and are highly liquid 
the investment in such securities are limited by the company s investment guidelines to of statutory surplus in order to minimize the impact of large changes in the stock market on its surplus 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with investment advisors  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines 
the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio
