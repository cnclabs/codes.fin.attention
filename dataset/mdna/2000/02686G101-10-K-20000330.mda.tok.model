the partnership received net proceeds of approximately  and recognized a gain of approximately  for the year ended december  a distribution of per unit related to this prepayment was declared in november and paid to unitholders in february in november  the mortgage on heather ridge apartments was prepaid 
the partnership received net proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain of approximately  for the year ended december  a distribution of per unit related to this prepayment was declared in november and paid to unitholders in february in february  the general partner instructed the servicer for the mortgage on water s edge of new jersey  a fully insured acquired construction loan  to file a notice of default and an election to assign the mortgage with hud 
the property underlying this construction loan is a nursing home located in trenton  new jersey 
as of december   the partnership had received approximately million on the assignment proceeds  including partial repayment of the outstanding principal and accrued interest 
hud has disallowed approximately million of the assignment claim  which is included in receivables and other assets 
the general partner retained counsel in this matter and is actively pursuing litigation against the loan servicer  greystone servicing corporation  inc greystone  for the amount disallowed by hud 
on july   the partnership filed a motion for judgment against greystone in the circuit court of fauquier county  virginia 
the motion for judgment alleges breach of contract and negligence claims and seeks judgment for  the amount disallowed by hud  plus interest  attorneys fees and costs 
in the motion for judgement  the general partner alleges as follows 
pursuant to a mortgage servicing contract  the participation and servicing agreement psa  greystone was obligated to ensure that the requirements for preserving hud insurance on the loan was satisfied 
specifically  the psa required greystone to prepare a written notice of default in the event the borrower defaulted on the mortgage loan repayment obligation and to file notice of such default with hud within thirty days after an uncured borrower s cure period 
due to greystone s failure to timely file a notice of default with hud  hud applied a surcharge of  to the insurance proceeds due aim  as permitted pursuant to the fha insurance contract 
on february   american insured mortgage investors  lp series and greystone servicing corporation  inc presented oral arguments for summary judgement before the court in this matter and the court has taken those motions under advisement 
a trial date has been set for the end of july  and a ruling on these motions may be issued at any time 
the partnership believes that the allowance for loan losses of  as of december   is sufficient to provide for amounts that may not be recovered from the servicer 
coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage

liquidity and capital resources on october   criimi mae  the parent of the general partner  and criimi mae management  inc  an affiliate of criimi mae and provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code 
such bankruptcy filings could result in certain adverse effects to the partnership 
for example  as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner or to the general partner of cmslp  the partnership s sub advisor  without approval from the bankruptcy court 
even though this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
furthermore  the bankruptcy filings could negatively impact cmslp which could result in the need to obtain another party to perform the services currently performed by cmslp  as subadvisor  pursuant to the sub advisory agreement

the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows and were sufficient during the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating expense requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although the insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base  resulting from monthly mortgage payment receipts or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance on insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages  which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in net earnings in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in mortgage investment income discussed previously 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in receivables and other assets during related to the sale of the property underlying st 
charles place phase ii and the remaining amounts due from the coinsurance lender 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to due to an increase in mortgage disposition proceeds from approximately million in versus approximately million received in net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in distributions paid to partners 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in net earnings  which was caused by a decrease in the mortgage asset base 
additionally  cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in receivables and other assets 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to the increase in the amount of mortgage disposition proceeds received in as compared to net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to due to an increase in distributions paid to partners as a result of the disposition of the mortgages on northpoint apartments  olmstead park apartments  arbor village  water s edge ii apartments and olde mill apartments  and a principal curtailment made on the mortgage for olde mill apartments prior to the disposition of the mortgage
