the higher effective tax rate for the thirty five week period ended december   is the result of the increase in non deductible goodwill amortization related to the company s acquisitions in september and october comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues

the higher effective tax rate for fiscal is the result of goodwill amortization and certain acquisition costs not being deductible for tax purposes

aztec entered into a credit facility with its bank lenders in july  with amendments made to the underlying agreement on october  and september  as of december   aztec was in noncompliance with certain financial covenants under the facility 
on march   aztec and its bank lenders further amended the facility to provide aztec with a waiver of noncompliance for the fourth quarter of the amendment advances the maturity date of the facility from july  to april  and replaces the financial covenants with a minimum debt service coverage covenant and a capital expenditures covenant of no more than million for the amendment requires the payment of overadvance fees in the event that after june  the outstanding balance of the credit facility exceeds a percentage of the company s accounts receivable 
the overadvance fees are payable by the company at april  or in connection with the sale of its subsidiaries or securities 
the fees are of the overadvance amount  if any  as of july   plus of the overadvance amount  if any  that exists as of the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the amendment has provisions that aztec commit to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue an initial public offering of the stock of psci as well as to pursue additional financing of million through the sale of equity or debt securities 
the company anticipates that its working capital line of credit and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for its existing operations through the end of our ability to continue to meet our liquidity requirements  however  may be influenced by a number of factors  including our ability to raise funds through the capital markets and to sell certain subsidiaries 
we have initiated preliminary discussions with potential investors to raise capital through the private sale of debt or equity securities and have entered into negotiations for the sale of our voice and data subsidiaries 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to access the capital markets on favorable terms  or at all  or be able to divest our non core subsidiaries on favorable terms  or at all 
the amendment contemplates that we will reduce the maximum amount that the banks are required to lend  or the loan commitment  through the payment of certain proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries  or the sale of securities  or through other sources 
a failure to sufficiently reduce the amount of the the loan commitment on a timely basis would result in the obligation to grant the bank lenders warrants to purchase up to of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
these warrants will be immediately exercisable and have a term of three years 
the issuance of the warrants and the number of shares purchasable under the warrants will be based on the satisfaction of certain loan commitment reduction milestones during in the event that the company is unable to timely reduce the loan commitment by approximately  and by june   september  and december   respectively  the company will be required to issue to the bank lenders warrants to purchase  and  respectively  of the company s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis 
in no event will the company to be required to issue warrants to purchase in the aggregate over of the outstanding stock 
the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be registered securities 
aztec does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during the year ended december  the thirty five weeks ended december   fiscal or fiscal recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the application of the guidance in sab will be required in the company s second quarter of the effects of applying this guidance  if any  will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle 
the company does not expect the adoption of sab to have a material effect on its financial statements  however  the final evaluation of sab is not yet complete 
year readiness disclosure statements aztec has not experienced any problems with its computer systems relating to the inability of such systems to recognize appropriate dates associated with year aztec is not aware of any material year problems with its clients or vendors 
accordingly  aztec does not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems 
factors that may affect future results compliance with bank amendment aztec received a waiver of noncompliance from its bank lenders in the fourth quarter of with certain financial covenants under its credit facility 
the amendment advances the maturity date of the credit facility from july  to april  and replaces the current financial covenants with a minimum debt service coverage covenant and a capital expenditure covenant 
the amendment contemplates that aztec will divest certain of its non core subsidiaries and raise additional capital or debt through the capital marketplace and contemplates a loan reduction schedule through april  aztec has committed to proceed on a commercially reasonable basis with the initial public offering of its web application subsidiary  pcsi 
there can be no assurance that aztec will be able to successfully complete the divestiture of its non core subsidiaries  or that it will be able to access the capital markets to raise additional funds  or that it will be able to complete the initial public offering of pcsi 
failure to raise sufficient funds through such divestitures and equity or debt financings to comply with the amended loan reduction schedule will result in the incurrence of additional fees payable to the bank lenders  a significant increase in interest rate charges due under the credit facility and the issuance of common stock purchase warrants  with an exercise price of per share 
if we were unable to comply with the amended financial covenants  there can be no assurance that the bank lenders would grant additional waivers which  if not granted  could result in the amount of outstanding borrowings under the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable and could impair our ability to continue as a going concern 
risk of substantial dilution in the event of non compliance with the bank amendment in the event that we fail to reduce the loan commitment amount at set milestones we will be required to issue to the bank lenders certain stock purchase warrants to purchase up to of our common stock on a fully diluted basis at 
per share 
in the event that the bank lenders receive and exercise such warrants  our stockholders would recognize substantial dilution and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
attraction and retention of employees aztec s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
aztec s success depends in large part on its ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain technical professionals 
at december  approximately of aztec s employees were technical professionals 
qualified technical professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that aztec will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of technical professionals in the future 
an increase in turnover rates could have a material adverse effect on aztec s business  including its ability to secure and complete engagements and obtain new business  which could have a material adverse effect on aztec s operating results and financial condition 
reliance on key personnel aztec s operations depend on the continued efforts of ira cohen  its president and chief operating officer  ross weintraub  its chief financial officer  its operating company presidents  including benjamin tandowski  the president of pcsi  and the senior management of certain of its operating companies 
if any of these people becomes unable to continue in his or her present role  or if aztec is unable to attract and retain other skilled professionals  aztec s business could be adversely affected 
aztec does not currently maintain key man life insurance policies for any of its officers or other personnel 
variability of quarterly operating results the company has experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
factors that may cause the company s quarterly operating results to vary include the number of active client projects  the requirements of client projects  the termination of major client projects  the loss of major clients  the timing of new client engagements  and the timing of personnel cost increases 
certain of these factors may also affect the company s personnel utilization rates  which may cause further variation in quarterly operating results 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long and the company s services are impacted by both the financial condition and management decisions of its clients and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed at the beginning of any period and the company s general policy is to not adjust its staffing levels based upon what it views as short term circumstances  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in losses for any particular period 
in addition  many of the company s engagements are  and may be in the future  terminable by its clients without penalty 
a termination of a major project could require the company to maintain under utilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected percentage of unassigned professionals  or to terminate the employment of excess personnel 
due to all of the foregoing factors  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be below the expectations of investors for any given fiscal period 
rapid technological change as with all it solutions companies  aztec s success will depend in part on its ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that aztec will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  aztec will be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render aztec s services uncompetitive or obsolete 
aztec s failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on aztec s operating results and financial condition 
potential conflicts in distribution aztec  us office products  and the other companies spun off by us office products on june   together with aztec  the spin off companies entered into a distribution agreement  tax allocation agreement  and employee benefits agreement 
the spin off companies also entered into the tax indemnification agreement 
these agreements provide for  among other things  usop and aztec to indemnify each other from tax and other liabilities relating to their respective businesses prior to and following the distribution 
certain indemnification obligations of aztec and the other spin off companies to usop are joint and several 
therefore  if one of the other spin off companies fails to satisfy its indemnification obligations to usop when such a loss occurs  aztec may be required to reimburse usop for all or a portion of the losses that otherwise would have been allocated to such other spin off company 
in addition  the agreements allocate certain liabilities  including general corporate and securities liabilities of usop not specifically related to the specific businesses to be conducted by the spin off companies and post distribution usop among usop and each of the spin off companies 
adverse developments involving usop or the other spin off companies  or material disputes with usop  could have a material adverse effect on aztec 
the terms of the agreements that govern the relationships among aztec  usop and the other spin off companies were established by usop in consultation with management of aztec and the other spin off companies prior to the distribution and while aztec and the other spin off companies were wholly owned subsidiaries of usop 
the terms of these agreements  including the allocation of general corporate and securities liabilities among usop  aztec  and the other spin off companies  may not be the same as they would be if the agreements were the result of arms length negotiations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of the agreements are not more or less favorable to aztec than those that might have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
on the distribution date  jonathan j 
ledecky  chairman of the usop board of directors  received options for  shares of the company s common stock and options for shares of each of the other spin off companies exercisable for of the common stock of each of the other spin off companies 
as a result of the receipt of the options  mr 
ledecky had interests in the distribution that differed in certain respects from the interests of other stockholders of usop and aztec 
potential liability for taxes related to the distribution in connection with the distribution  aztec entered into a tax allocation agreement with usop and the other spin off companies  which provides that aztec and the other spin off companies will jointly and severally indemnify usop for any losses associated with taxes related to the distribution distribution taxes if an action or omission an adverse tax act of any of the spin off companies materially contributes to a final determination that any or all of the spin offs in the distribution are taxable 
aztec also entered into a tax indemnification agreement with the other spin off companies under which the spin off company that is responsible for the adverse tax act will indemnify the other spin off companies for any liability to indemnify usop under the tax allocation agreement 
as a consequence  aztec will be liable for any distribution taxes resulting from any adverse tax act by aztec and will be liable subject to indemnification by the other spin off companies for any distribution taxes resulting from an adverse tax act by the other spin off companies 
if there is a final determination that any or all of the distributions are taxable and it is determined that there has not been an adverse tax act by either usop or any of the spin off companies  usop and each of the spin off companies will be liable for its pro rata portion of the distribution taxes based on the value of each company s common stock after the distribution 
as a result  aztec could become liable for a pro rata portion for distribution taxes with respect to not only its own spin off  but to the spin offs of the other spin off companies 
risks related to allocation of certain liabilities in the distribution under the distribution agreement  aztec is liable to usop for i any liabilities arising out of or in connection with the business conducted by it or its subsidiaries  ii its liabilities under the employee benefits agreement  tax allocation agreement and related agreements  and iii certain liabilities under the securities laws related to the distribution 
each of the other spin off companies is similarly obligated to usop 
aztec and the other spin off companies have also agreed to bear a pro rata portion of i usop liabilities under the securities laws other than claims relating solely to a specific spin off company or relating specifically to the continuing businesses of usop and ii usop s general corporate liabilities other than debt  except for that specifically allocated to the spin off companies incurred prior to the distribution ie  liabilities not related to the conduct of a particular distributed or retained subsidiary s business the shared liabilities 
if one of the other spin off companies defaults on an obligation owed to usop  the other non defaulting spin off companies will be obligated on a pro rata basis to pay such obligation default liability 
as a result of the shared liabilities and default liability  aztec could be obligated to usop in respect of obligations and liabilities not related to its business or operations and over which neither it  nor its management  has or has had any control or responsibility 
the aggregate of the shared liabilities and default liability for which any spin off company may be liable is  however  limited to million 
material amount of goodwill and intangibles as of december   approximately million  or of aztec s total assets  and of aztec s stockholders equity  constituted goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
aztec currently amortizes goodwill on a straight line method over a period ranging from years and identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis  generally over four years with the amount amortized in a particular period constituting a non cash expense that reduces aztec s operating results 
amortization of goodwill resulting from certain past acquisitions  and additional goodwill recorded in certain future acquisitions  may not be deductible for tax purposes 
the company recorded a non cash accounting charge of million in the third and fourth quarters of related to the impairment of certain intangible assets 
of this amount  million was related to the company s review of the carrying value of its intangible assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
based on this review  certain intangible assets were reduced to their estimated fair value 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write off goodwill based on the company s announced closing of its canfield  ohio location 
if goodwill becomes further impaired  aztec would be required to write down the carrying value of the goodwill and incur a related charge to its income 
a reduction in net income resulting from the amortization or write down of goodwill could have a material and adverse impact upon the market price of aztec common stock 
effect of anti takeover provisions the aztec board has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by aztec stockholders 
the rights of the holders of aztec common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock 
while aztec has no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such issuance  while providing desired flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of aztec and entrenching current management 
in addition  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to those of the aztec common stock  and  as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the aztec common stock 
a number of provisions of aztec s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws and the delaware general corporation law relating to matters of corporate governance  certain rights of directors  and the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  may be deemed to have and may have the effect of making more difficult  and thereby discourage  a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or assumption of control and change of incumbent management  even when stockholders other than aztec s principal stockholders consider such a transaction to be in their best interest 
intellectual property rights the success of certain of aztec s operating companies is dependent in part on certain methodologies these companies use in designing  installing  and integrating computer software and systems and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
these operating companies rely on a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws to protect their proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties  enter into confidentiality agreements with their key employees  and limit distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by these operating companies in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that these operating companies will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce their intellectual property rights 
although aztec believes that its services do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others and that it has all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in its business  aztec is subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require aztec to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of an asserted infringement claim
