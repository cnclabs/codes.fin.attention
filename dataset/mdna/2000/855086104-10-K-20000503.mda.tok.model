there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
during fiscal and fiscal  however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry
