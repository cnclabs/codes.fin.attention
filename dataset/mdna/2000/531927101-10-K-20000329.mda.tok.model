general and background lifecell corporation is a bioengineering company engaged in the development and commercialization of tissue regeneration and cell preservation products 
our core preservation technology produces an acellular tissue matrix  which retains the essential biochemical and structural components necessary for normal tissue regeneration 
we currently market three products based on this technology alloderm r for the reconstructive plastic  burn and dental markets  cymetra tm a micronized version of alloderm for the reconstructive plastic and dermatology markets  and repliform r acellular tissue for the urology and gynecology market 
we believe that our products are the only commercially available tissue transplant products that provide a complete template for the regeneration of normal human soft tissue 
we estimate that alloderm has been transplanted in more than  patients 
we also are developing several additional products  including small diameter vascular grafts as an alternative to autografted blood vessels  orthopedic applications of our acellular tissue matrix  and thrombosol tm a formulation for extended storage of platelets 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware in as the successor to a delaware corporation that was incorporated in results of operations years ended december  and the net loss for the year ended december   increased to approximately million compared to approximately million for the increase was principally attributable to higher costs associated with the company s increased marketing activities for its alloderm products  increased investment in the company s product development programs  increased expenditures for the infrastructure to support these activities and relocation costs related to the company s move to new jersey

interest income and other  net increased to approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  for the increase was principally attributable to higher funds available for investment during the current period as a result of the million net proceeds received from the public offering of common stock in december liquidity and capital resources since its inception  lifecell s principal sources of funds have been equity offerings  debt  product sales  external funding of research activities and interest on investments 
lifecell has historically funded research and development activities for products other than alloderm primarily with external funds from its corporate alliance with medtronic and government grants 
in december  lifecell was awarded a two year contract of approximately million from the united states army to support the development of vascular graft and other products 
in june  lifecell was awarded a  contract from the united states navy related to the development and clinical research of thrombosol 
in september and november  lifecell was awarded two contracts from the united states navy related to the preservation of human platelets 
such grants total approximately million 
in  lifecell entered into an agreement with medtronic pursuant to which medtronic paid lifecell a license fee of million and agreed  subject to certain rights to terminate at medtronic s discretion  to fund certain costs of the research and development of lifecell s proprietary tissue processing technology in the field of heart valves 
through december   lifecell had recognized approximately million in revenues for development funding  excluding the initial license fee  for this program 
in december  lifecell and medtronic mutually agreed to terminate their early stage license and development agreement related to heart valves in order to focus on near term opportunities 
lifecell regained all rights to its cardiovascular technology 
as a result of terminating the agreement  the million up front licensing fee paid by medtronic to lifecell in converted into  shares of common stock 
in december  lifecell received net proceeds of approximately million pursuant to a public offering of million shares of common stock 
in march  the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of the company s common stock to boston scientific in connection with the agreement for worldwide marketing and distribution of its proprietary acellular tissue matrix for applications in urology and gynecology 
in november  lifecell received net proceeds of approximately million pursuant to a private placement of  shares of common stock 
also  in december  the company closed on a debt financing of approximately million 
as of december   the company has drawn down million of this facility 
in february  the company drew down an additional million on the debt facility 
lifecell expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with its efforts to expand sales and marketing of alloderm  develop expanded uses for alloderm  conduct the company s product development programs including costs of clinical studies  prepare and make any required regulatory filings  introduce products  participate in technical seminars and support ongoing administrative and research and development activities 
the company currently intends to fund these activities from its existing cash resources  sales of products and research and development funding received from others 
while the company believes that its existing available funds will be sufficient to meet its present operating and capital requirements through  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet these future expenses 
if adequate funds are not available  the company expects it will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its product development programs 
the company s need for additional financing will be principally dependent on the degree of market acceptance achieved by the company s products and the extent to which the company can achieve substantial growth in product sales during and  as well as the extent to which the company may decide to expand its product development efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
lifecell has had losses since its inception and therefore has not been subject to federal income taxes 
as of december   lifecell had net operating loss nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively  available to reduce future income tax and tax liabilities 
federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit lifecell s ability to use its nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s sale of common stock in the public offering resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
the company estimates that the amount of nol carryforwards and the credits available to offset taxable income subsequent to the offering will be approximately million on a cumulative basis 
accordingly  if lifecell generates taxable income in any year in excess of its then cumulative limitation  the company may be required to pay federal income taxes even though it has unexpired nol carryforwards 
year compliance the year issues related to the possibility that computer programs and embedded computer chips might be unable to accurately process data with year dates of and beyond 
prior to december   lifecell made the necessary revisions or upgrades to its systems to render them year compliant 
subsequent to december   the company experienced no significant events  nor received any significant reports indicating any material year issues 
the costs incurred in to address potential year issues were not material 
we are unaware of any uncorrected problems regarding the year issue at this time  but will continue to monitor for any potential problems throughout item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rates 
the company s revolving loan and term loan borrowings bear interest at variable rates and therefore  changes in u 
s interest rates  affect interest expense incurred thereon 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s future operations or cash flows
