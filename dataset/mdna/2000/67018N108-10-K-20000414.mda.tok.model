the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are a manufacturer and supplier of high availability  high performance internet storage and customized san solutions  including external raid solutions  tape backup products and advanced storage management software solutions for a variety of operating systems including  unix  windows nt and linux 
our activities in the information storage industry have evolved through several acquisitions  the first of which occurred in june when we acquired certain assets associated with the raid business in lake mary  florida  from seagate peripherals  inc in december  we acquired substantially all the net assets of parity systems  inc in june and july  we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of andataco and in november  we acquired the remaining of andataco 
as a result of the acquisition of andataco  we believe that period to period comparisons for the year ended december  may not be meaningful 
in addition  due to the fact that andataco s operating results were not included in our consolidated financial statements until june  we expect that many of the components of our future operating results will increase significantly in fiscal in january   we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary which we had acquired in april  including certain patented technology referred to as adaptive raid  to a wholly owned subsidiary of qlogic corporation for million 
we do not anticipate that future revenues will be materially affected as a result of this transaction 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization write down of goodwill loss from operations interest expense and other  net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary loss from debt extinguishment net loss comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for fiscal included an extraordinary loss of 
million on extinguishment of debt see note to consolidated financial statements 
sales sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the preceding year  an increase of million or 
the primary factor for the increase was the acquisition of andataco in june  partially offset by delays in the market introduction of certain new generation products and our elimination of non storage related businesses  including memory and integrated systems divisions approximately million in 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an oem agreement to supply high performance raid storage enclosures to sgi  a major server manufacturer 
the initial term of the arrangement was expected to be for three years 
between may and october  sales to sgi totaled approximately million 
in the third quarter of  sgi made the decision to phase out their windows nt product to which our storage systems were attached 
as a direct result  actual shipments to sgi subsequent to october have been minimal and are not expected to increase in the near future 
sgi accounted for of our net sales for two oem customers  discrete logic and intergraph corp  accounted for and  respectively  of net sales 
cost of sales gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  contributing to the improved gross margins were the andataco product sales and the utilization of andataco s sales channels to market our products 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on dynamic market pricing and on product mix which fluctuate from time to time 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased to million of sales from million of sales for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of andataco  which was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at our lake mary location 
the reduction in expenses at that location is primarily attributable to the elimination of expenses associated with the integrated system division which was sold in october the most significant increase in expenses resulted from compensation and related benefits of additional employees brought about by the acquisition of andataco 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  amounted to million  representing of sales as compared to the year ended december  when expenses were million or of sales 
during january  we sold substantially all of the assets of our borg adaptive technologies subsidiary  which had contributed 
million and 
million to our research and development expenses during and  respectively 
decreases in research and development expenses in as a result of this sale  however  are expected to be partially offset by additional investments in research and development which we believe will be required to remain competitive 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are substantially incurred in advance of related revenues  or in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization write down of goodwill depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   principally due to the acquisition of andataco  which added million of amortization of goodwill and 
million of depreciation in during the fourth quarter of see note to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a goodwill write down of approximately million 
this write down eliminated all remaining unamortized goodwill related to the acquisition of parity systems  inc parity 
the parity goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of the company s inability to generate future operating income from the assets acquired in the parity acquisition 
interest expense interest expense in increased million over as a result of the acquisition of andataco which significantly increased our net average borrowings see note to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
preferred stock dividends eitf addresses accounting for preferred stock which is convertible into common stock at a discount from the market rate at the date of issuance 
in accordance with this eitf a preferred stock dividend attributable to such a beneficial conversion privilege should be recorded for the difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of common stock at the date of issuance 
accordingly  during we recorded 
million as an embedded dividend attributable to the beneficial conversion privilege of certain classes of our convertible preferred stock as compared to million in see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for the year ended december   all classes of our convertible preferred stock required cumulative dividends at and aggregated 
million as compared to 
million in the increase was principally due to additional issuances of preferred stock in comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million from the year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the preceding year  a decrease of million or 
factors contributing to this sales decline included i delays in customer deliveries and in some cases  missed sales orders in early  caused by our inability to meet customer production schedules brought about by our cash flow difficulties at that time  ii lost sales opportunities while reorganizing and training our sales force under new executive sales management  and iii entering with a significantly lower balance of sales orders than were in place as of the beginning of another significant factor was a million decrease in non storage related product sales  including memory products and enterprise resource planning manufacturing software  as a result of our decision to phase out our non storage related businesses 
cost of sales gross profit gross profit decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the previous year 
our gross profit is dependent  in part  on product mix which fluctuates from time to time 
the decline in gross profit is primarily due to a decreased sales level of products with overall higher margins and certain cash flow difficulties which limited our ability to purchase products in the most cost efficient manner 
excluding additions to inventory reserves  the overall gross profit for would have been as compared to for operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales and million of sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the 
million decrease is principally attributable to overall reduced spending levels resulting from planned cost reductions  primarily advertising and travel  which were implemented as a result of the lower sales levels 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales increased during principally attributable to the level of certain fixed costs we incurred while sales levels declined 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and remained relatively unchanged from the preceding year 
certain of these expenses decreased as a result of the continued integration of previously acquired engineering activities 
this decrease was offset by increased engineering staffing and related overhead of 
million resulting from the acquisition in april of borg adaptive technologies  and increased project costs in connection with the development of new products 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are substantially incurred in advance of related sales  or in certain situations  may not ultimately generate sales 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased 
million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily due to additions to test equipment and computer software 
interest expense interest expense in increased 
million over as a result of a significant increase in net average borrowings and the amortization of loan costs in connection with certain indebtedness 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
preferred stock dividends during we recorded million as an embedded dividend attributable to the beneficial conversion privilege of certain of our preferred stock 
in addition  for the year ended december   all classes of our convertible preferred stock required cumulative dividends at and aggregated 
million

the most significant use of cash for both fiscal years was our loss from operations before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items as well as changes in assets and liabilities of million in and million in the loss from operations was partially offset by a million decrease in inventories and a 
million decrease in accounts receivable 
in  net cash used by operating activities also reflected a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities and a 
million increase in inventories

asset based credit facilities andataco revolver the andataco revolver provides for borrowings based on the lesser of million or i of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  plus ii the lesser of million or of eligible inventory  as defined 
the andataco revolver currently bears interest at prime plus percent at december  and matures in april we pay a facility fee of 
based on the average unused portion of the maximum borrowings 
advances under the andataco revolver are collateralized by substantially all assets of andataco 
the andataco revolver provides for certain financial covenants  including andataco maintaining a certain minimum tangible net worth 
during the second quarter ended june   andataco was not in compliance with that financial covenant  however  effective july   the lender agreed to waive the default  subject to  among other things  receipt from nstor of a 
million capital contribution 
on july   nstor contributed 
million in cash as a capital contribution to andataco 
as of december   the outstanding balance under this credit facility was million and an additional 
million was available based on eligible collateral 
at february  and march   andataco was not in compliance with the minimum tangible net worth covenant of the andataco revolver 
effective march   the lender agreed to waive the default for both periods 
effective april  we have agreed with the lender to amend certain terms of the andataco revolver including the following a change in the borrower from andataco to nstor corporation  inc  another wholly owned subsidiary  an increase in the interest rate to prime plus  and new minimum net worth and net income covenants on a consolidated basis 
all other significant provisions of the andataco revolver are the same 
effective april   mr 
levy agreed to commit to a million revolving line of credit facility to us  which bears interest at per annum 
the maturity date on this line of credit is the earlier of april  or when we execute our amended andataco revolver 
nstor revolver in january  we paid off the outstanding balance and terminated the nstor revolving line of credit agreement nstor revolver 
during fiscal  the nstor revolver provided for borrowings based on the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
interest was paid based on prime plus 
advances under the nstor revolver were collateralized by substantially all of our assets excluding those of andataco  including 
million reflected as restricted cash as of december  the balance under the nstor revolver as of december was  financing activities from late through december   we obtained net cash proceeds of approximately million including million during the year ended december  from private investors  consisting of sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock  net borrowings and the exercise of warrants and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
of these amounts  mr 
levy or a company controlled by mr 
levy had advanced or invested a net amount of million 
in december  we issued  shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of million of notes payable 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized a 
million extraordinary loss from debt extinguishment 
on january   we sold substantially all of the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  borg adaptive technologies  including our patented adaptive raid technology  to a wholly owned subsidiary of qlogic corporation 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million  net of approximately 
million of transactions costs  of which million was used to repay short term notes payable to mr 
levy 
as part of the sale  we retained a perpetual license in and to the adaptive raid technology 
we do not anticipate that future revenues will be materially affected as a result of this transaction 
we believe that amounts expected to be available under the andataco revolver and our available cash balances  principally as a result of the borg sale  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs during  as presently contemplated 
there can be no assurance that we may not require additional capital beyond our current forecasted needs nor that any such additional required funds would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  at such time or times as required by us 
effect of inflation during recent years  inflation has not had an impact on the our operations and we do not expect that it will have a material impact in year issue as many computer systems  software programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively referred to as information systems use only two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue concerns not only information systems used solely within a company but also concerns third parties  such as customers  vendors and creditors  using information systems that may interact with or affect a company s operations 
we have not experienced any material disruption in our business or operations as a result of yk issues 
however  there is no assurance that we will not experience interruptions in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations
