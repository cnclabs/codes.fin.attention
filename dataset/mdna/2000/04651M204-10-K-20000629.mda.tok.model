item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  publishes  and distributes interactive entertainment for the children s education edutainment  leisure entertainment  and gaming enthusiast s markets for a variety of platforms 
the company employs a portfolio approach to achieve a broad base of published products across most major consumer software categories 
since it commenced operations in february  the company has experienced rapid growth and its product and customer mix has changed substantially 
publishing and distribution are the two major activities of the company 
publishing is divided into frontline  leisure and children s publishing 
because each of these product categories has different associated costs  the company s margins have depended and will depend  in part  on the percentage of net revenues attributable to each category 
in addition  a particular product s margin may depend on whether it has been internally or externally developed and on what platforms it is published 
further  the company s margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of its new published product releases 
to the extent that mass merchants require greater proportions of third party software products  some of which may yield lower margins  the company s operating results may be impacted accordingly 
the worldwide interactive entertainment software market is comprised primarily of software for two distinct platforms pcs and dedicated game consoles 
the market has grown dramatically in recent years with its growth driven by the increasing installed base of multimedia pcs and current generation game console systems 
in addition  the development of enabling multimedia technologies  the proliferation of software titles  the development of new and expanding distribution channels and the emergence of a strong international market for interactive entertainment software have spurred the rapid expansion of the interactive entertainment market 
there has been an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations affecting the company s products  coupled with increased competitiveness for shelf space and buyer selectivity 
the market for frontline titles has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher production budgets  more complex development processes  longer development cycles and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development and production process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit cost and schedule overruns 
this in turn has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or storylines of such hit titles into additional interactive entertainment software products in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  the company is determined to achieve a balance between development done by its own internal development studios and that done by third party developers 
along with its industry competitors  the company had historically capitalized royalties advanced to third party developers as a prepayment in current assets and evaluated the realization of these royalty advances on a quarterly basis 
the market changes noted above have made it extremely difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  in the quarter ended december   the company expensed royalty advances of million on products that were in development or on sale 
in connection with this change in the dynamics of the marketplace  the company changed its accounting  beginning on january   for future royalty advances  treating such costs as research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred 
multi year output advances will continue to be capitalized as royalty advances and expensed over the development periods  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the distribution channels for interactive software have changed significantly in recent years 
traditionally  consumer software was sold through specialty stores 
today  consumer software is increasingly sold through mass merchants such as wal mart  kmart and target  as well as major retailers  including office depot  best buy  compusa  aafes  sam s club and babbage s 
the internet and on line networks also present a new channel through which publishers and distributors can distribute their products to end users 
sales are recorded net of expected future returns 
higher than anticipated returns were experienced in the last fiscal year  and management has taken a substantial provision for price protection as stated below 
management continually assesses and re evaluates the rate of returns and price protection based on business conditions and market factors

the company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s hedging activities do not subject it to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term obligations since the majority of the company s long term obligations are at fixed rates
