item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during  compaq s operations and corresponding organizational structures were realigned into three strategic global business groups that offer products and services tailored for particular market segments 
they are managed separately as each global business group targets different markets with diverse technology and solutions needs 
financial data for periods reported prior to the realignment have been restated to conform to the current presentation 
the year ended december  reflects the acquisitions of digital  sdc and zip in june  february and april  respectively 
these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
in august  compaq sold a majority interest in altavista company a business acquired in the digital acquisition  sdc and zip collectively altavista to cmgi 
accordingly  the results of operations and the estimated fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in compaq s financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition through divestiture or december   as applicable 
compaq completed the acquisition of tandem in august this acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  consequently  the financial information for has been restated to reflect the merger with tandem 
compaq s reportable segments are enterprise solutions and services  commercial personal computing  and consumer 
enterprise solutions and services provides business critical servers  industry standard servers  storage products and nonstop ebusiness solutions  as well as professional and customer services 
commercial personal computing delivers standards based computing emphasizing internet access through workstations  desktops  portables  monitors  internet access devices and life cycle management products 
consumer targets home users with internet ready desktop pcs  portables  printers and related products  as well as internet access and e services 
business activities that do not qualify for separate segment reporting are aggregated in other and are comprised primarily of altavista and cfs  a wholly owned financing subsidiary 
the following table sets forth segment revenue and operating income for  and year ended december in millions enterprise solutions and services revenue    operating income    commercial personal computing revenue    operating income loss  consumer revenue    operating income other revenue operating income loss consolidated segment totals revenue    operating income    the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those used in the preparation of compaq s consolidated financial statements 
compaq evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income  which includes sales and marketing expenses  research and development costs and other overhead charges directly attributable to the operating segment 
certain expenses which are managed outside of the operating segments are excluded 
these consist primarily of corporate  including other income and expense items  and unallocated shared expenses  income taxes  and other non recurring charges for purchased in process technology and restructuring and related charges 
unallocated shared expenses are comprised primarily of indirect information management expenses  certain costs related to business integration and other general and administrative expenses that are separately managed 
gains and losses associated with sale of businesses and investments are excluded from segment operating income 
compaq does not include inter segment transfers for management reporting purposes 
a reconciliation of compaq s consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income loss before provision for income taxes follows year ended december in millions consolidated segment operating income    corporate and unallocated shared expenses  restructuring and related charges purchased in process technology  merger related costs gain on sale of businesses  income loss before provision for income taxes   overview compaq reported consolidated net income of million compared to a consolidated net loss of billion in the consolidated net loss in included a one time charge for purchased in process technology of billion related to the acquisition of digital 
the other key factors contributing to higher net income in were higher consolidated segment operating income and gains from the sale of businesses  partially offset by higher corporate and unallocated shared expenses and a non recurring charge for restructuring and related matters 
consolidated earnings adjusted for non recurring items declined from billion in to million in such adjusted consolidated earnings in were lower due to a decline in segment operating income and higher corporate and unallocated shared expenses 
consolidated revenue in increased billion  or percent  compared with  as a result of higher revenue from all three business segments 
in  revenue was billion  an increase of billion  or percent  over revenue amounts in reflect the acquisition of digital from june through the remainder of the year while revenue reflects digital amounts for the entire year 
total gross margin was percent in  versus percent in the overall decline in was primarily due to lower margins in commercial personal computing  representing aggressive pricing practices in this segment 
gross margin in decreased percentage points when compared to as a result of lower margins in all three business segments 
significant pricing and promotional actions taken by compaq in the north american region during the first half of adversely affected gross margin for that year 
operating expenses increased billion  or percent  and billion  or percent  in and  when compared to the respective prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense was higher in both years  primarily as a result of the digital acquisition 
during  investment in research and development increased as a result of compaq s activities as a full service enterprise computing company  offering leadership technologies and products for the future 
operating expenses declined in the second half of as compared to the first half of the year due to the continuation of compaq s restructuring activities begun in the second quarter of  compaq s additional restructuring and cost containment initiatives begun in the third quarter of  and a reduction of goodwill amortization and other operating expenses related to the sale of altavista 
enterprise solutions and services enterprise solutions and services revenue increased billion  or percent  in as compared to the enterprise business accounted for percent of compaq s consolidated revenue in  an increase from percent in enterprise solutions and services revenue in benefited from a full year of the digital business acquired in june the overall increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the business critical server  storage products  customer services and professional services divisions 
storage products revenue grew as a result of this division s leadership position in open storage area network products 
the customer services division benefited from significant growth in asia pacific  latin america and greater china  reflecting recovery from asian and latin america economic crises 
revenue has also improved in this division as a result of growth in software support and business critical services 
professional services division outsourcing business and e business strengths favorably impacted segment revenue 
additionally  the industry standard servers division benefited from a higher market share in north america  as well as the introduction of the proliant way server 
enterprise solutions and services revenue grew billion  or percent  in when compared with the major contributors to higher revenue in were the industry standard servers  customer services and professional services divisions 
revenue increased in these divisions primarily due to the acquisition of digital  which provided compaq with a world class services organization with market focused solutions and high availability support  particularly in the communications  manufacturing and finance industries 
enterprise solutions and services operating income increased million  or percent  in as compared to gross margin  while declining percentage points  remained strong in the enterprise business 
increasing gross margins in the storage products and professional services divisions were offset by a decline in gross margins in the industry standard servers and business critical server divisions 
the overall decrease in gross margin was primarily due to competitive pricing and a product mix shift to lower margin products within several divisions 
operating expenses declined percentage points on a percentage of revenue basis  primarily due to the benefit of compaq s restructuring actions 
enterprise solutions and services operating income was lower by million  or percent  from to as a result of an percentage point decline in gross margin coupled with higher operating expenses 
the overall decline in gross margin in was primarily due to lower margins in the storage products and industry standard servers divisions 
during the third quarter of  compaq announced intentions to cease product development of compaq s alphaserver systems that run windows nt operating systems 
compaq will instead focus its windows nt efforts on its intel based proliant platform  targeting alphaservers using compaq tru unix and openvms operating systems toward the high end enterprise market 
compaq is attempting to mitigate  through a customer benefit program  the impact of its decision to cease development of alphaservers that run windows nt for certain customers who previously deployed windows nt on compaq s alphaservers 
compaq expects to begin providing such benefits in and that the related costs will negatively impact segment operating income by up to million in commercial personal computing commercial personal computing revenue increased million  or percent  in as compared to this business represented percent of compaq s consolidated revenue for  a decline from percent in unit sales growth of percent was partially offset by a percent decrease in average unit prices  which were lower due to competitive pricing and a shift in product mix 
demand for portable products in commercial personal computing shifted from higher end mobility and power to lower cost 
in  commercial personal computing revenue decreased million  or percent  as compared to  as higher revenue from desktop and portable pcs was offset by lower revenue from displays and peripherals 
commercial personal computing operating loss increased million in as compared to due primarily to lower gross margins 
gross margin declined percentage points primarily due to average unit prices falling faster than costs for components  processors  memory and hard drives for desktop and portable pcs 
gross margin also suffered from aggressive competitive bidding and increased costs for extended warranties 
compaq is striving to improve profitability in this segment by increasing direct sales through extranets and web based transactions  as well as through call centers 
further  the recent purchase of key assets from inacom will add custom configuration capabilities and direct fulfillment logistics that should enable compaq to accelerate the direct program in north america 
operating expenses declined slightly in as a percentage of revenue due to an increased focus on sales and marketing spending as well as support costs 
commercial personal computing reported an operating loss of million for  a decline of billion from the operating loss resulted from lower gross margins and higher operating expenses 
gross margin was adversely affected by a percent reduction in average unit prices  which declined due to aggressive price reductions and promotional activities implemented primarily in north america in response to competitive pricing conditions 
operating expenses increased percentage points as a percentage of revenue from to consumer consumer revenue increased billion  or percent  in as compared to this business represented percent of compaq s consolidated revenue in and revenue grew primarily due to unit growth of percent  partially offset by a decline in average unit prices of percent 
strong consumer demand contributed to revenue growth in this segment 
component costs continued to decline which allowed compaq to reach lower price points  thus spurring consumer demand 
an increase in international sales also drove total revenue higher  particularly in latin america and asia pacific 
higher revenue from internet access and traffic benefited the consumer segment in consumer revenue grew billion  or percent  in over higher revenue in resulted primarily from unit growth of percent  partially offset by a percent decline in average unit prices 
consumer operating income increased million  or percent  from to the increase in operating income was attributable to higher gross margin in absolute dollars and slightly lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  as well as the increase in revenue as noted above 
consumer operating income remained flat from to  despite an increase in revenue 
consumer gross margin decreased percentage points in compared to primarily due to lower gross margins for desktop pcs  which largely resulted from a decrease in the average unit price 
operating expenses were slightly lower as a percentage of revenue in as compared to other included in other for was altavista revenue of million and operating loss of million 
the altavista operating loss for this period includes goodwill and intangibles amortization of million 
as previously discussed  compaq sold a majority interest in altavista to cmgi in august the other category in total incurred an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in corporate and unallocated shared expenses the results of the business segments exclude separately managed corporate  including other income and expense items  and unallocated shared expenses  which increased million in  and million in  as compared to the respective prior year 
the increase in unallocated shared expenses in and was primarily due to higher information management  acquisition integration  and other general shared costs 
corporate items in included higher foreign currency losses of million and lower interest income of million  partially offset by a net gain from compaq s investment portfolio of million 
purchased in process technology as previously reported  upon consummation of the digital acquisition in june  compaq expensed approximately billion representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate includes a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
if these projects are not successfully developed  compaq s revenue and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on compaq s estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects 
estimated revenues projected average compounded annual revenue growth rates of percent to percent during  depending on the product areas 
the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was expected to be lower than digital s on a stand alone basis percent in digital s fiscal  primarily due to compaq s expected ability to achieve more favorable pricing from key component vendors and production efficiencies due to economies of scale through combined operations 
estimated selling  general and administrative costs were expected to more closely approximate compaq s cost structure approximately percent of revenues in  which was lower than digital s cost structure approximately percent of revenues in digital s fiscal 
no assurances can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
compaq began to benefit from the purchased in process technology in late and is continually monitoring its development projects 
as expected in the normal course of product development  certain projects have experienced delays and other projects are being evaluated due to changes in strategic direction and market conditions 
during the third quarter of  compaq announced intentions to cease product development of compaq s alphaserver systems that run windows nt operating systems 
compaq will instead focus its windows nt efforts on its intel based proliant platform  targeting alphaservers using compaq tru unix and openvms operating systems toward the high end enterprise market 
compaq is attempting to mitigate  through a customer benefit program  the impact of its decision to cease development of alphaservers that run windows nt for certain customers who previously deployed windows nt on compaq s alphaservers 
compaq expects to begin providing such benefits in and that the related costs will negatively impact segment operating income by up to million in restructuring and related charges in september  compaq s management approved a restructuring plan to realign compaq s organization  reduce infrastructure and overhead  and eliminate excess and duplicative facilities 
restructuring and related charges of million million  net of tax were expensed 
these charges were composed of million of accrued restructuring costs  million of related asset impairment charges and a million pension curtailment loss to recognize a change in compaq s projected pension benefit obligation in connection with employee separations 
components of accrued restructuring costs and amounts charged against the provision as of december  were as follows in millions beginning accrual expenditures december  employee separations facility closure costs contract cancellation and other exit costs accrued restructuring costs for employee separations related to approximately  employees worldwide affecting the majority of business functions  job classes and regions  predominantly occurring in north america and europe 
employee separation benefits include severance  medical and other benefits 
facility closure costs of million were associated with the closure of million square feet of manufacturing  distribution and office space in north america  europe and asia through sale or lease terminations 
contract cancellation and other exit costs of million primarily related to terminating contractual obligations in connection with exiting the compaq branded networking products business  and included million for non cash items 
compaq expects to substantially complete the initiatives contemplated in its restructuring plans during compaq believes that  upon conclusion of its restructuring initiatives  its cost structure will be significantly reduced 
however  there can be no assurance that such cost reductions can be sustained or that the estimated costs of such actions will not change 
in connection with the restructuring action  compaq performed a review of its long lived assets to identify potential impairments 
as a result of this review  compaq recorded a million charge during the third quarter of for asset impairments resulting from abandonment or write down to fair value of certain assets 
approximately million related to the closure of a compaq assembly plant in asia 
in june  compaq recorded a restructuring charge of approximately billion to integrate the operations of compaq and digital  consolidate duplicative facilities  improve service delivery and reduce overhead 
approximately billion was related to the acquisition of digital and recorded as a component of purchase accounting and million related to compaq and was charged to operations 
accrued restructuring costs included separation benefits for approximately  employees  consolidation and closure of million square feet of office  distribution and manufacturing space  termination of digital contractual obligations and relocation costs of digital employees 
employee separation benefits included severance  medical and other benefits 
compaq has completed most of the actions contemplated under the restructuring plan 
accrued restructuring costs at december  include amounts for actions that have already been taken  but for which expenditures have not yet been made 
accrued restructuring costs as of december  and amounts charged against the provision were as follows in millions beginning accrual expenditures december  expenditures december  employee separations  facility closure costs relocation other exit costs in the fourth quarter of  compaq adjusted the digital restructuring plan for changes in estimates  which resulted in a reduction of million of accrued digital restructuring costs 
this reduction was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation 
during  compaq recorded a million charge related to asset impairments 
the asset impairments resulted from the write down to fair market value  less costs to sell  of assets taken out of service and held for sale or disposal 
as a result of the and restructuring actions  approximately million of the total accrual at december  related to future cash payments to employees separated prior to december  for the year ended december   employee separations due to both restructuring actions totaled approximately  of which approximately  were pursuant to the restructuring action approved in september the net headcount reduction for the year ended december   including attrition and restructuring  offset by selective hiring  totaled approximately  since the date of the digital acquisition  employee separations due to restructuring actions were approximately  the net headcount reduction since the date of the digital acquisition  including attrition and restructuring  offset by selective hiring  was approximately  total headcount at december  was approximately  gain on sale of businesses in august  compaq sold an percent equity interest in altavista for approximately million cmgi common shares  cmgi preferred shares convertible into million cmgi common shares and a million three year note receivable 
in october  cmgi converted the cmgi preferred shares held by compaq into million cmgi common shares 
all of the cmgi common shares owned by compaq carry certain restrictions whereby compaq may not sell percent of its cmgi common shares in less than one year from the date of the disposition and the remainder in less than months 
total consideration received from cmgi was valued at billion 
after adjusting for the net assets sold and for the expenses associated with the divestiture  compaq realized a gain of approximately billion million  net of tax 
compaq accounts for its minority investments in cmgi and altavista under the cost method 
all cmgi share information reflects cmgi s two for one stock split  effective january in june  compaq sold certain network switching assets for million in cash 
compaq realized a gain on the sale of these assets of million million  net of tax  recorded as gain on sale of businesses 
the assets sold consisted of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
other items in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas  as amended  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  fas requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedged transaction and the type of hedge transaction 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in earnings 
compaq has elected to adopt fas effective january   and accordingly  compaq will be required to adjust hedging instruments to fair value in the balance sheet and recognize the offsetting gains or losses as adjustments to be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate 
compaq believes that such adoption will not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
compaq will adopt sab as required in the first quarter of and is evaluating the effect that such adoption may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
liquidity and capital resources compaq s cash and cash equivalents decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  the decrease primarily resulted from billion used in investing activities  offset in part by billion provided by operating activities 
net cash of billion provided by operating activities was comprised primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items of billion  offset by million used in working capital and other activities 
net cash used in working capital and other activities resulted primarily from cash payments for restructuring activities and an increase in long term lease receivables  partially offset by accounts receivable collections and an increase in other current liabilities 
days sales outstanding for was days 
from time to time  compaq may sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial 
accounts receivable sold were million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory turns in were net cash of billion used in investing activities resulted primarily from the following items 
compaq paid cash of million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of sdc and million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of zip compaq also used cash of billion for capital expenditures  net of disposals 
net cash of million was invested in short term investments 
cash of million was used for other investing activities 
cash used for financing activities of million consisted primarily of net short term borrowings and common stock transactions of million and million  respectively  offset by a million payment for the retirement of digital preferred stock and million for stockholder dividends 
future uses of cash include cash expenditures for currently planned restructuring activities estimated to be billion  the majority of which will be expended in  capital expenditures for land  buildings and equipment which are estimated to be billion in  and purchases of equipment to be leased to third parties of approximately million in compaq also plans to use available liquidity to develop the purchased in process technology related to the digital acquisition into commercially viable products 
at december   the estimated costs to be incurred to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products totaled approximately billion in the aggregate through the year million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in 
other future uses of cash include a payment of approximately million  as well as the assumption of related liabilities  to acquire certain configuration and distribution assets of inacom  a provider of information technology services and products 
compaq has also provided a commitment to inacom to enter into a million secured revolving credit facility  subject to certain conditions 
inacom could begin to draw on this facility in may if the aforementioned conditions are met 
borrowings under such facility will bear interest at percent over the rate applicable under inacom s revolving credit facility 
compaq currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
compaq has a billion revolving credit facility bearing interest at libor plus percent that expires in october and a billion revolving credit facility bearing interest at libor plus percent that expires in october both of these facilities were unused at december  and compaq has also established two short term commercial paper programs a billion program in the name of compaq computer corporation  and a billion program in the name of cfs 
both programs are supported by the billion credit facility described above 
outstanding commercial paper reduces available borrowings under this credit facility 
at december   compaq had million in commercial paper outstanding under the compaq program  with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
no commercial paper was outstanding under the cfs program at december  additionally  compaq maintains various uncommitted lines of credit  which totaled approximately million at december  there were no outstanding borrowings against these lines at december  and compaq believes that these sources of credit provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet future funding requirements 
compaq continually evaluates the need to establish other sources of working capital and will pursue those it considers appropriate based upon its needs and market conditions 
factors that may affect future results compaq participates in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by intense industry wide competition 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices  continually changing customer demand patterns  and rapid technological developments 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report 
inability to transition to direct sales could negatively affect financial results 
in recent years  the market for personal computers has shifted from sales through resellers toward direct sales to end users 
compaq sells directly to end users in all market sectors  but the largest proportion of direct sales are in large enterprise accounts 
products in commercial personal computing are sold primarily through third party resellers while products in consumer are sold principally through retail outlets 
direct sales present a more efficient business model for personal computer sales  particularly for small and medium businesses and large enterprise accounts  where customers require custom configured products with short delivery cycle times 
compaq has not kept pace with changes in the industry s sales and distribution model and has faced challenges in developing and implementing processes for order entry  production of individualized units and direct distribution 
compaq has established a variety of programs designed to achieve these capabilities by simplifying its product set and pricing model  re engineering the channel delivery model and more rapidly expanding e commerce capabilities for large  medium and small businesses 
compaq s future operating results may be negatively impacted if it is unable to rapidly transition much of its personal computer sales to a more direct model 
the risks associated with compaq s most recent actions in this area  the acquisition of certain assets of inacom  are discussed below 
acquisition of direct delivery assets could fail to bring operational improvements 
compaq has purchased certain operational assets of inacom that should enhance compaq s ability to sell commercial personal computing products directly to end users 
the acquired assets should provide important capabilities  including enhanced product configuration and options offerings  expanded asset planning and tracking capabilities  and end to end order management for complex orders 
while compaq is confident that the acquired assets will provide the tools to achieve improved efficiency and enhanced customer satisfaction  there continue to be risks 
if compaq fails to integrate the inacom assets and successfully execute its strategy of bringing products to market directly  this could have a material adverse impact on its business 
in addition  if compaq does not achieve direct capacity quickly  its transition from indirect sales to direct sales could lead to a loss of revenue if resellers favor other brands or if the financial condition of resellers erodes 
compaq also confronts other risks associated with the acquisition of direct capacity  including the transition of manufacturing and distribution to former inacom facilities  reliance on resale of the products of other computer manufacturers  and low profitability associated with acting as a configurator for other computer manufacturers 
credit risks could increase if financial condition of resellers erodes 
compaq s primary means of distribution is through distributors and resellers 
compaq continually monitors and manages the credit it extends to distributors and resellers and attempts to limit credit risks by utilizing risk transfer arrangements and obtaining security interests 
recently  distributors and resellers have been consolidating in response to changes in the profitability of their businesses 
compaq s business could be adversely affected in the event that the financial condition of its distributors and resellers erodes 
upon the financial failure of a distributor or reseller  compaq could experience disruptions in distribution as well as a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any outstanding accounts receivable 
competitive environment places pressure on revenue and gross margins 
competition remains intense in the information technology industry with a large number of competitors vying for market share 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment  which continues to put pressure on revenue and gross margins 
compaq has experienced this pressure  particularly in its commercial personal computing business and could experience similar pressures in its industry standard server business in the future 
inability to meet product rollout expectations could affect product demand and financial results 
the process of developing new  high technology products and services is complex and uncertain 
as a result  compaq may commit substantial investments in new technology  including products like its high end alphaserver product code name  wildfire  before knowing whether there is sufficient demand for the product 
successful product transitions and deployment of new products requires accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix and configuration 
compaq may also anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance which differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
additionally  the timing of a product s rollout must match customers demand for a particular product 
a failure on the part of compaq to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated could directly affect the demand for the product and the profitability of compaq s operations 
new form factors introduce uncertainty into the market 
the increasing reliance on the internet is creating new dynamics in the computer industry 
as businesses and consumers turn to the internet  speed and connectivity may become more critical than stand alone power for client devices 
compaq intends to introduce a new generation of internet devices that will be built around simple form factors  customized functions and wireless mobility 
compaq s products will vie for market share against those of computer companies as well as consumer electronics and telecommunications companies 
hardware products  which are compaq s traditional area of strength  may become less important than service offerings in attracting and retaining customers 
in addition  as new form factors are adopted  sales of traditional personal computers may decline 
services business may not grow as fast as market for services 
the services business within the enterprise solutions and services segment  like other segments  faces intense competition for its business in the markets in which this segment competes 
compaq intends to expand its services business through its focus on providing e infrastructure to strengthen its customers e business success  development of new areas of expertise  and maximization of existing relationships with strategic alliances 
future results will depend on the execution of this expansion strategy in this growing market 
compaq s success in its expansion efforts and profitability in any fiscal period depends  in part  on a number of factors  one of which may be the ability to retain its existing share of the targeted services market 
increased players in the marketplace coupled with an inability to keep pace with the growth rate in an expanding market for services may provide an opportunity for competitors to gain market share 
there can be no assurance that  in executing this strategy  compaq will be able to maintain the continued demand and acceptance by customers in this market 
delays in new systems implementation could hamper operational efficiency 
compaq continues to focus on increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of its business and information management processes to increase customer satisfaction  improve productivity and lower costs 
in connection with these efforts  compaq is moving many of its systems from a legacy environment of proprietary systems to client server architectures  as well as integrating systems from newly acquired businesses 
although major portions of this transition have been completed  integrating the systems from the inacom asset acquisition as well as remaining digital and tandem systems that are not integrated complicates this process 
this year is critical to this effort because delays in the transition to new systems could hamper compaq s efforts to increase its operational efficiency 
delays in implementing further improvements could adversely affect inventory levels  cash and related profitability 
inability to retain employees could hamper business operations 
in searching for new employees and retaining its current employees compaq competes with other technology companies  including start up internet companies that may be perceived as offering significant opportunities to realize wealth 
in its integration and restructuring efforts over the past year  compaq lost a number of sales and service employees in europe 
compaq s failure to attract key employees to fill these openings or the loss of significant numbers of additional key employees could make it difficult for compaq to achieve its current business plans 
restructuring activities could impede operations 
compaq undertook significant restructuring activities in that will continue to be carried out in in addition  a number of actions remain to be completed from its restructuring activities initiated in compaq expects to substantially complete the initiatives contemplated in its restructuring plans during these activities are focused on alignment around three business groups  each of which will be structured to be competitive within its sphere of operations 
compaq is focused on bringing its operational expenses to appropriate levels for each of its businesses while simultaneously implementing extensive new programs 
the significant risks associated with these actions include delays in decision making  lack of clear lines of authority during transitions  customer confusion about compaq s future products and services  and an adverse impact on employee morale and retention 
compaq believes that  upon conclusion of its restructuring initiatives  its cost structure will be significantly reduced 
however  there can be no assurance that such cost reductions can be sustained  that the estimated costs of such actions will not change  or that certain targeted areas require additional headcount or investment to achieve desired levels of profitability 
integrating businesses could divert focus 
in integrating acquisitions  compaq confronts challenges in synchronizing diverse product roadmaps and business processes and integrating logistics  marketing  product development  services and manufacturing operations to achieve efficiencies 
timing of these decisions is a critical element in compaq s success 
taking the necessary steps may lead to gaps in short term performance  furthermore  delaying action will reduce compaq s ability to compete effectively because resources and people will be too dispersed to achieve acceptable rates of return 
compaq s high end business in particular has been affected by the steps necessary to achieve appropriate expense levels in the field  particularly in france and germany  and the need to implement appropriate sales and services organization recruitment  training and incentive plans 
minority investments could adversely affect liquidity and earnings 
compaq holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within compaq s strategic focus 
some of these investments are in research and development  start up or development stage companies or companies where operations are not yet sufficient to establish them as going concerns 
as a result  compaq may be called upon under contractual or other terms to provide funding for operations of such investees and may share in the losses of such entities 
while compaq s share of such losses has not been significant to date  compaq anticipates that such losses will increase in the future 
certain investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile 
while the overall financial impact of these investments has been favorable thus far  adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in compaq incurring losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of its investments 
quarterly sales cycle makes planning and operational efficiencies difficult 
compaq  like other computer companies  generally sells more products in the third month of each quarter than in the first and second months 
this sales pattern places pressure on manufacturing and logistics systems based on internal forecasts and may adversely affect compaq s ability to predict its financial results accurately 
in addition  to rationalize manufacturing utilization  compaq may build products early in the quarter in anticipation of demand late in the quarter 
developments late in a quarter  such as lower than anticipated product demand  a systems failure  or component pricing movements  can adversely impact inventory levels  cash and related profitability  in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected 
component shortages could curtail production 
from time to time  supply for key components in compaq s products lags behind worldwide demand 
in the event that supply of a key material component is delayed or curtailed  compaq s ability to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected 
industry shortages currently exist for certain types of display panels  microprocessors  memory and capacitors 
compaq attempts to mitigate the risks of component shortages by working closely with key suppliers on product plans  coordinated product introductions  purchases on the spot market  and selected strategic purchases 
doing business in certain locations creates additional risks 
manufacturing operations in developing countries  such as brazil and china  and the expansion of sales into economically volatile areas such as asia pacific  latin america and other emerging markets  subject compaq to a number of economic and other risks  such as financial instability among resellers in these regions 
compaq generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in emerging markets  in particular asia pacific and latin america  when compared to united states and european markets 
compaq is also subject to any political and financial instability in the countries in which it operates  including inflation  recession  currency devaluation and interest rate fluctuations 
compaq continues to monitor its business operations in these regions and takes various measures to manage risks in these areas 
opportunities for market share in the consumer business could increase revenue 
in october  two of compaq s competitors in the consumer market announced that they would curtail their sales to consumers in north america 
their departure will give compaq an opportunity to gain market share and increase revenue 
compaq s ability to take advantage of these changes could be hampered by component shortages and strong competition in the consumer sector 
although compaq believes that certain of these customers will be attracted to compaq s brand  compaq remains focused on profitable market share growth and will not compete solely on price 
year compliance 
compaq is currently not aware of any year problem in any of its products  critical systems or services 
however  the success to date of its year efforts cannot guarantee that a year problem affecting third parties upon which it relies will not become apparent in the future 
the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure statement under the year readiness and disclosure act 
compaq s year program was designed to minimize the possibility of serious year interruptions 
possible year worst case scenarios include the interruption of significant parts of compaq s business as a result of critical information systems failure or the failure of suppliers  distributors or customers 
since these possibilities could not be eliminated  compaq incorporated year concerns into its contingency plans for dealing with catastrophic events 
in  compaq established a task force to address its personal computer product and customer concerns  and a separate task force to address its internal information systems  including technology infrastructure and embedded technology systems and the compliance of its suppliers and distributors 
in  compaq integrated the tandem and digital task forces with its own so that the task force addresses the product and information systems and supplier and distributor concerns for the entire company 
with respect to product readiness  the compliance definitions of compaq  tandem and digital remain in effect for most of the respective follow on products of each company 
the readiness status of compaq  tandem and digital products has been available on the compaq year web site at www 
compaq 
com year since in addition to selling tested products  compaq also offered a range of year readiness services 
because there is no uniform definition of year compliance and because all customer situations could not be anticipated  particularly those involving other vendors products  compaq anticipated changes in demand or increases in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
such events  should they have occurred  could have a material adverse impact on future results 
in  substantially all internal information systems and other infrastructure areas including communication systems  building security systems and embedded technologies in areas such as manufacturing processes were identified  assessed and categorized for year readiness as priority  and  with being critical  being intermediate and being non critical with no impact on business operations 
as of september   compaq was complete with its remediation of priority and priority items and closed the third quarter in a year ready environment worldwide for its internal supporting systems and infrastructure 
to ensure that the integrity of the year ready internal environment was maintained  a freeze on changes to applications and infrastructure  with tightly controlled exceptions  had been established from october  to january  although compaq has lifted the freeze on changes to applications and infrastructure  it is taking additional steps to identify and monitor noncompliance of any of the application changes made after january   as well as infrastructure changes 
compaq has conducted a review of its internal production equipment  production and procurement suppliers and key channel partners regarding year readiness 
internal production equipment has been tested and upgraded to achieve a year readiness state 
suppliers  including strategic oems  have been reviewed and risk assessments have been completed 
management believes that each of its strategic oems has achieved a year readiness state or is implementing plans to achieve readiness in a timely manner 
in certain cases  compaq has identified critical component suppliers who operate in what the company has deemed high risk countries 
while these suppliers continue to address their year issues  compaq has finalized contingency plans for these components and will implement these plans as appropriate 
reviews of key channel partners have also been completed and substantially all key channel partners responded that they expected to address any year issues in a timely manner or have contingency plans in place 
with respect to suppliers and distributors  because compaq s readiness depends upon their successful remediation of year problems  failures on the part of suppliers and distributors remain a possibility and could have a material adverse impact on future results 
compaq carried out major planned enterprise wide internal system renewal efforts 
these planned major enterprise wide system renewals were incorporated into the year readiness effort 
installations were scheduled through the end of through the month of january  compaq s global operations were fully functioning and have not experienced any significant issues associated with the year transition 
based on compaq s ongoing evaluation of internal information and other systems  and system renewal rollout schedules  compaq does not anticipate future significant business interruption 
however  should business interruption occur  there could be a material adverse impact on future results 
the costs of the readiness program for products are primarily costs of existing internal resources largely absorbed within existing engineering spending levels 
these costs were incurred primarily in and earlier years and were not broken out from other product engineering costs 
no future material product readiness costs are anticipated 
the costs of the readiness program for internal information and other systems and suppliers and distributors are a combination of incremental external spending and use of existing internal resources and expertise 
over the life of the internal readiness effort  these costs were approximately million for the three years ended december  additional costs were incurred primarily in connection with incident management  finalizing and validating business continuity plans  and program shutdown 
the costs of implementing enterprise wide system renewal efforts are not included in this approximation of costs incurred to date 
milestones and implementation dates and the costs of compaq s year readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available that may change underlying assumptions or requirements included in this estimate 
effective tax rate 
compaq s effective tax rate for was percent 
this rate is primarily affected by the proportion of manufacturing income compaq earns in singapore that is subject to a tax holiday and by tax rates in the various jurisdictions that were affected by gain on sale of businesses and restructuring charges 
compaq anticipates an effective tax rate of percent for the singapore tax holiday for manufacturing operations can be maintained through august if cumulative investment levels and other conditions are maintained 
compaq s tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that is derived from its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
compaq will cease utilization of a portion of its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary s production capacity during the profitability of this facility is expected to decrease significantly  accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the impact of the tax holiday on compaq s effective tax rate 
in addition  should compaq s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary for prior years require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  compaq s overall tax rate could increase 
currency fluctuations 
compaq s risks associated with currency fluctuations are discussed in item a below 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting compaq s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
market risk s compaq is exposed to market risks  which include changes in united states and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
compaq attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions 
compaq uses market valuations and value at risk valuation methods to assess the market risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios 
it uses software by riskmetrics to estimate the value at risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios based on estimates of volatility and correlation of market factors drawn from riskmetrics data sets for the dates calculated 
riskmetrics defines loss as a reduction in the value of a portfolio in the event of adverse market conditions  using a predetermined confidence interval  over a specified period of time 
compaq included all fixed income investments  interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange contracts in the value at risk calculation 
see note and note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these instruments 
the holding period for these instruments varies from one day to nine months 
the measured value at risk from holding derivative and other financial instruments  using a percent confidence level and assuming normal market conditions during the years ended december  and  was immaterial 
the value of the us dollar affects compaq s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect compaq s revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings as expressed in us dollars 
compaq engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
compaq primarily uses forward exchange contracts to hedge those assets and liabilities that impact the income statement when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for some markets  compaq has determined that ongoing hedging of non us dollar net monetary assets is not cost effective and instead attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially if a significant and sudden decline occurs in the value of local currencies 
compaq purchases foreign currency option contracts from time to time as well as short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the anticipated revenues of compaq s international marketing subsidiaries  with the exception of latin america and other subsidiaries that reside in countries in which such activity would not be cost effective or local regulations preclude this type of activity 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of compaq s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by compaq are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although compaq maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  compaq s revenues or costs are adversely affected when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which compaq sells products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which compaq incurs costs 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on compaq s cash equivalents and short term investments  and interest expense on short term borrowings 
compaq does not enter into derivative transactions related to its cash  cash equivalents or short term investments 
compaq does periodically enter into interest rate swap transactions for the purpose of hedging existing or anticipated liabilities 
all interest rate swaps entered into by compaq are for the sole purpose of hedging existing or anticipated interest rate sensitive positions  and not for speculation 
compaq is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of investments in publicly traded equity securities 
these investments are generally in companies having operations or technology in areas within compaq s strategic focus 
compaq does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a percent adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate billion decrease in the fair value of compaq s available for sale securities as of december
