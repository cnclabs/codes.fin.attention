these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates and the allocations represent the estimated fair values related to the incomplete projects determined by appraisals using appropriate assumptions and valuation techniques 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technology had no alternative future use 
the technology acquired in these acquisitions has required substantial additional development by the company 
the purview acquisition was completed in january and a commercially viable product was shipped in september the product development investment in the purview technology made by the company from the date of acquisition through september was million

in connection with the elron transaction  the company received net proceeds of million and incurred thousand of direct transaction costs 
pursuant to the elron transaction  the company sold assets that had a carrying value of million  and recorded a gain of million during interest income  net 
interest income  net increased as a percent of total revenue from in to in the increase is primarily a result of the decline in revenue from to and an increased cash balance due to the consummation of the elron transaction during the first quarter of interest income  net decreased as a percent of total revenue from in to in this decrease is due to a increase in net revenue from to and lower cash levels during other income

income taxes 
in the year ended december  and  the company incurred a significant operating loss for both book and tax purposes and gave benefit to refundable income taxes which offset certain foreign tax provisions and as a result no tax provision was recorded 
the company recorded a book gain on the sale of assets to elron  however  for tax purposes the company recognized an ordinary loss on this transaction 
the provision for represents additional minimum taxes owed 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through private and public placements of capital stock and the net proceeds received from the elron transaction 
at december    and the company had available cash and cash equivalents of million  million  and million  respectively  and working capital of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   the company has a million letter of credit guarantee outstanding for a subsidiary against a line of credit with a foreign bank and a million letter of credit guarantee outstanding securing our new facility lease 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities consisted of a million loss from operations which was the result of a million charge for purchased incomplete research and development relating to the acquisitions of purview technologies inc and csd software gmbh  a million charge for asset write down related to restructuring charges  depreciation and amortization of million  and changes in assets and liabilities of million

the company believes that its existing cash balances  funds generated from operations  and available borrowings under its line of credit will be sufficient to finance the company s operations through december in the event the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
year readiness disclosure as of the date of this filing  the company has not incurred any significant business disruptions as a result of year issues 
however  while no such occurrence has developed  year issues that may arise related key suppliers and service providers may not become apparent immediately 
the company has received assurances from key suppliers and service providers such as financial institutions  our payroll service provider and our retirement plan administrator as to their year readiness 
the company can provide no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by these suppliers and service providers due to noncompliance in the future 
certain factors that may affect future results the sale of meetingmaker would eliminate a historically significant source of the company s cash flow and may result in cash flow deficits 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  meetingmaker produced  and  in revenues   and  in operating profits  and significant cash flow 
these results positively impacted the company s overall financial performance 
in addition  the cash flow generated by the meetingmaker business was available to support the activities of the ccm business which  historically  has been unprofitable and had negative cash flow 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  the remaining businesses had operating losses of  and  producing significant negative cash flow 
management believes that  in the absence of substantial investment  for fiscal and thereafter meetingmaker s operating profits and positive cash flow would substantially diminish  if not disappear in their entirety 
in contrast  management believes that the ccm business will achieve operating profits and positive cash flow at some time during fiscal and beyond 
these expectations form the basis of management s decision to divest the meetingmaker business 
if these expectations turn out to be incorrect  especially insofar as ccm is concerned  the company may experience substantial cash flow deficits 
our ccm product marketing strategy differs from our previous marketing strategy the target market for ccm is entirely different from the target market for the groupware products we had marketed and sold through our free trial marketing system prior to the target market for ccm consists primarily of large corporations such as deutsche telekom  mci worldcom and autonation all existing ccm customers 
ccm product sales per customer are generally in the range of  to  as opposed to an average sale per customer for our groupware products of approximately  sales of ccm products pose significantly greater financial risks  and require greater up front investments in marketing  technical and financial resources  than sales of our historical products 
as a result  we have adopted a marketing strategy using a direct sales force and in field service organization 
this strategy requires significant investments in additional marketing and technical personnel  retraining of existing personnel  ongoing product development and creation of an in field service organization 
we have developed valuable marketing and service experience and expertise in europe and  recently  in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to expand and apply such experience and expertise to the ccm market 
for the twelve months ended december   one customer accounted for million  or of net revenue from the company s current products 
for the twelve months ended december   two customers accounted for million  or of net revenue 
it is possible that the company s change in marketing strategy will result in other customers accounting for more than of the company s net revenues 
we will need to expand our distribution channels in order to develop our business and increase revenue we sell our products through our direct sales force and a limited number of distributors  and we provide maintenance and support services through our technical and customer support staff 
we plan to continue to invest large amounts of resources in our direct sales force  particularly in north america 
in addition  we are developing additional sales and marketing channels through value added resellers  system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other channel partners 
we may not be able to attract channel partners that will be able to market our products effectively  or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
if we establish distribution through such indirect channels  our agreements with channel partners may not be exclusive 
as a result  such channel partners may also carry competing product lines 
if we do not establish and maintain such distribution relationships  this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if the market for our enterprise desktop management software solutions does not continue to develop as we anticipate  our ability to grow our business and sell our products will be adversely affected in recent years  the market for enterprise software solutions has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product announcements and introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in response to advances in technology  customer requirements have become increasingly complex  resulting in industry consolidation of product lines offering similar or related functionality 
in particular  we believe that a market exists for integrated enterprise wide infrastructure management solutions 
however  the existence of such a market is unproven 
if such a market does not fully develop  this could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
regardless of the development of a market for integrated infrastructure management solutions  factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of our enterprise desktop management applications could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards  or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our products may decline as a result of rapid technological change in our industry  our position in existing markets or other markets that we may enter can be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance depend in part upon our ability to improve existing products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer needs  and respond to competitive products 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the technological requirements of the ccm products may present additional challenges in product development which  if we cannot meet  may have a material adverse effect on our business the technological demands of the ccm products require a commitment of significant ongoing financial  technical and personnel resources to product development  training of service technicians and customer training 
because our historical products were not as technologically sophisticated as ccm  we have not to date made all of the required investment and have not proven that we can develop and maintain the organization required to support such products 
we believe that our experience with ccm to date will provide a valuable base on which to build the necessary financial  technical and personnel resources to continue to sell  market  develop and support the ccm products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand and develop our resources to support ccm products 
ccm is typically larger and more complex than the products that we have previously developed 
our ability to continue to enhance ccm to meet customer and market requirements will depend substantially on our ability to effectively manage this development effort  to attract and retain the required development personnel in waltham  massachusetts and starnberg  germany and to coordinate and manage geographically remote development efforts 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products 
any such new or improved products may not achieve market acceptance 
our current or future products may not conform to industry requirements 
if  for technological or other reasons  we are unable to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
errors in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products because our software products are complex  these products may contain errors that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
despite testing by on and by current and potential customers  errors in our products may be found in the future 
detection of such errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
if any of these results were to occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the future  inclusion of functions provided by ccm in system software and application suites may affect our competitive position in the future  vendors of operating system software and applications sold for a single price generally referred to as application suites may continue to enhance their products to include functions that are currently provided by ccm 
in addition  some vendors may bundle these products in their existing application suites at no additional charge 
the widespread inclusion of the functions provided by our products as standard features of operating system software could render our products obsolete and unmarketable particularly if the quality of such functions were comparable to the functions offered by our products 
furthermore  even if the software functions provided as standard features by operating systems are more limited than those of our products  there is no assurance that a significant number of customers would not elect to accept such functions instead of purchasing additional software 
if we were unable to develop new ccm software products to further enhance operating systems and to successfully replace any obsolete products  our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
new product introductions and the enhancement of existing products by our competitors could adversely affect our ability to sell our products the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
the technology for enterprise desktop management software products can change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced and existing products are continually enhanced 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we face competition from a number of sources  including o large and established companies such as microsoft  computer associates and ibm tivoli which offer client management capabilities as part of their systems  network or desktop management systems  o software companies and others who provide application suites such as intel and network associates  whose products include client management applications  o information technology and systems management companies such as ibm  computer associates international  and hewlett packard company  and o the internal information technology departments of those companies with infrastructure management needs 
in addition  microsoft has announced the zero administration initiative for windows zaw  which includes a set of technologies that address some of the same client management issues as ccm 
microsoft has described components of zaw as being available for the windows operating system  as well as the microsoft systems management server 
some of our current and many of our potential competitors have much greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than on has 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by on may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
new competitors and alliances among existing competitors could impair our ability to retain and expand our market share because competitors can easily penetrate the software market  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies as the market for enterprise desktop management applications develops 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
large software companies may acquire or establish alliances with our smaller competitors 
we expect that the software industry will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
system management companies may acquire enterprise desktop management providers and close their systems to our products  which could hurt our ability to sell our products our ability to sell our products depends in part on their compatibility with and support by providers of system management products  including tivoli  computer associates  and hewlett packard 
both tivoli and hewlett packard have recently acquired providers of help desk software products 
these providers of system management products may decide to close their systems to competing vendors like us 
they may also decide to bundle their infrastructure management and or help desk software products with other products for enterprise licenses for promotional purposes or as part of a long term pricing strategy 
if that were to happen  our ability to sell our products could be adversely affected 
increased competition may result from acquisitions of help desk and other infrastructure management software vendors by system management companies 
the results of increased competition  including price reductions of our products  reduced gross margins  and reduction of market share  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
due to the technological challenges associated with ccm  we may not have the financial resources necessary to conduct the business as presently contemplated our product development  marketing and sales costs for the ccm products are approximately  to  per month 
we believe that we have enough cash to fund these costs through december   whether or not we complete the sale of the meetingmaker product 
there can be no assurance that our estimate of the marketing  sales and product development costs of the ccm products is correct  or that these costs will not exceed our available financial resources  or that we will be locate additional sources of financing  if and when needed 
our increasing reliance on international revenue could adversely affect our operating results in and fiscal  total revenue from international licenses license revenue from outside the united states represented approximately of our total revenue 
for the fiscal year and thereafter  we expect that international revenue may constitute a significantly greater portion of our total revenue 
accordingly  a greater percentage of our total revenue may be subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on demand for its products  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown of european business activity in the third quarter and tariffs and other trade barriers 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a materially adverse effect on our future international license revenue 
our continued growth and profitability will require continued expansion of our international operations  particularly in europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
accordingly  we intend to expand our current international operations and enter additional international markets 
such expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we have only limited experience in developing local language versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell and deliver our products internationally 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as our expanding international operations in europe and elsewhere are increasingly conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency exchange losses a large portion of our business is conducted in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
we may implement a foreign exchange hedging program  consisting principally of purchases of one month forward rate currency contracts 
however  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
on january   certain member states of the european economic community  the eec  fixed their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro 
on that date  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the three years beginning on january   business in these eec member states will be conducted in both the existing national currencies  such as the french franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
companies operating in or conducting business in eec member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies  as well as the euro 
we are still assessing the impact that the euro will have on our internal systems and our products 
we will take corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined the costs related to this problem 
issues related to the introduction of the euro may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have a history of losses  we cannot predict our future operating results and we cannot assure our continued profitability through december   we have recorded cumulative net losses of approximately million 
in addition  our products and marketing strategy have changed substantially since the mid s 
we have acquired or developed a significant number of products in the last five years 
as a result  prediction of our future operating results is difficult  if not impossible 
there can be no assurance that we will become or remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  we do not believe that the growth in revenues we have experienced in recent years is necessarily indicative of future revenue growth or future operating results 
future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our stock price our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others o our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our software on a timely basis  o market demand for our software  the size  timing and contractual terms of significant orders  o the timing and significance of new software product announcements or releases by on or our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or our competitors  o changes in our business strategies  budgeting cycles of our potential customers  o changes in the mix of software products and services sold  o reliance on indirect sales forces like systems integrators and channels  o changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and o the impact of acquisitions of competitors  seasonal trends  the cancellations of licenses or maintenance agreements  product life cycles  software defects and other product quality problems  and personnel changes 
we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or weeks of that quarter 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing of revenue recognition can be affected by many factors  including the timing of contract execution and delivery 
the timing between initial customer contact and fulfillment of criteria for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
in the event of any downturn in potential customers businesses or the economy in general  planned purchases of our products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our concentration on the ccm business represents a new direction for our business and problems with the implementation of this strategy may adversely affect our business on january   we entered into an agreement to sell our groupware business to meeting maker  inc these actions were designed to focus us on ccm and end our involvement with the groupware business 
we cannot be sure that our new corporate strategy will be successfully implemented 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that we will not engage in further reorganizations or restructurings in the future 
our sales cycle is long and unpredictable  and potential delays in the cycle make our revenues susceptible to fluctuations the licensing of our software generally requires us to engage in a sales cycle that typically takes approximately four to nine months to complete 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition which we encounter in our selling activities 
during the sales cycle  we typically provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may affect our quarterly operating results our business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
our revenues and operating results in our december quarter typically benefit from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements  and from the efforts of our sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
in addition  we are currently attempting to expand our presence in international markets  including europe 
international revenues comprise a significant percentage of our total revenues  and we may experience additional variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in such foreign markets 
future acquisitions present risks which could adversely affect our business in the future  on may make acquisitions of  or large investments in  other businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that further our goal of providing enterprise desktop management software solutions to businesses or which complement our current business 
any future acquisitions or investments that we may complete present risks commonly encountered with these types of transactions 
the following are examples of such risks o difficulty in combining the technology  operations  or work force of the acquired business  o disruption of on going businesses  o difficulty in realizing the potential financial and strategic position of on through the successful integration of the acquired business  o difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  o possible impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel  o difficulty in adding significant numbers of new employees  including training  evaluation  and coordination of effort of all employees towards our corporate mission  o diversion of management attention  o difficulty in obtaining preferred acquisition accounting treatment for these types of transactions  likelihood that future acquisitions will require purchase accounting resulting in increased intangible assets and goodwill  substantial amortization of such assets and goodwill  and a negative impact on reported earnings  and o potential dilutive effect on earnings 
the risks described above  either individually or in the aggregate  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of on common stock  or a combination of cash and on common stock 
we have experienced significant growth in our ccm business in recent periods  and our ability to manage this growth and any future growth will affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability we have grown significantly in recent periods  with total ccm revenues increasing from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal if we achieve our growth plans  such growth may burden our operating and financial systems 
this burden will require large amounts of senior management attention and will require the use of other on resources 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth and our future operating results will depend in part on our ability to implement and expand operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage our employees 
in particular  in connection with acquisitions  we will be required to integrate additional personnel and to augment or replace existing financial and management systems 
such integration could disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our financial results 
we may not be able to augment or improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to future growth  if any 
any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our business depends in large part upon the protection of our proprietary technology the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on our business our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets and copyright to establish and protect our proprietary rights in software 
we use a printed shrink wrap license for users of our products distributed through traditional distribution channels in order to protect our copyrights and trade secrets in those products 
since these shrink wrap licenses are not signed by the licensee  many authorities believe that they may not be enforceable under many state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
if such licenses are not enforceable  the user would not be bound by the license terms  including the terms which seek to protect our proprietary technology 
if the printed shrink wrap licenses prove to be unenforceable  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect our proprietary rights or offer only limited protection for those rights 
furthermore  in countries with a high incidence of software piracy  we may experience a higher rate of piracy of our products 
we have obtained registrations in the united states for the following trademarks on technology  meetingmaker  ccm  on command ccm  notework  davinci systems  on technology design  on location and instant update 
we have filed for the trademark on command ccm in the european community  canada and australia 
as a result  we may not be able to prevent a third party from using our trademarks in many foreign jurisdictions 
we have not to date registered any of our copyrights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by on to protect our proprietary software technology will be adequate 
lesser sensitivity by corporate  government or institutional users to avoiding infringement of propriety rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights of technology companies 
we have not been involved in any such litigation 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others  any involvement in this type of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
in addition  since we may acquire or license a portion of the software included in our future products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of any software being acquired 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software and we generally obtain indemnification to cover any breach of such representations 
however  there can be no assurance that these representations are accurate or that such indemnification will provide us with adequate compensation for a breach of these representations 
in the future  we may need to initiate litigation to enforce and protect trade secrets and other intellectual property rights owned by us 
we may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could be costly and cause diversion of management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
adverse rulings or findings in such litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any one of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition  prospects and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses will be available to us on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
such laws provide only limited protection 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in particular  we may provide our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and  while we do not expect software piracy to be a persistent problem  some foreign laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
third parties could assert  for competitive or other reasons  that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  and such claims could injure our reputation  consume time and money  and adversely affect our ability to sell our products while we are not aware that any of our software product offerings infringe the proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may claim infringement with respect to our current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as a result  infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs to us our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims 
we may be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our senior management and other key personnel are critical to our business  and if they choose to leave on  it could harm our business our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and certain other key employees  including selected sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  few of our employees are bound by an employment or noncompetition agreement 
in addition  we do not generally maintain key man life insurance on any employee 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees or the decision of one or more such officers or employees to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
we may not succeed in attracting and retaining such personnel 
if we do not  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
future changes in the federal immigration laws could limit our ability to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries  and this could adversely affect our business and operating results to achieve our business objectives  we must be able to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries 
any future shortage of qualified technical personnel who are either united states citizens or otherwise eligible to work in the united states could increase our reliance on foreign professionals 
many technology companies have already begun to experience shortages of such personnel 
any failure to attract and retain qualified personnel as necessary could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
foreign computer professionals such as those employed by us typically become eligible for employment in the united states by obtaining a nonimmigrant visa 
the number of nonimmigrant visas is limited by federal immigration law 
currently  congress is considering approving an increase in the number of visas available 
we cannot predict whether such legislation will ultimately become law 
we also cannot predict what effect any future changes in the federal immigration laws will have on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
because on s officers and directors own a large portion of on common stock  they may be able to control most matters requiring stockholder approval  and this may prevent or discourage potential bids to acquire on based on shares outstanding as of march   on s officers  directors  and entities directly related to such individuals together beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of on common stock 
as a result  on s officers and directors may be able to control most matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations  and sales of all or substantially all of the assets of on 
such concentrated share ownership may prevent or discourage potential bids to acquire on unless the terms of acquisition are approved by such officers and directors 
provisions in our charter documents and in delaware law may discourage potential acquisition bids for on and prevent changes in our management which our stockholders favor certain provisions of on s charter documents eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and specify certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
such provisions are intended to increase the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the on board of directors and in the policies set by the board 
these provisions also discourage certain types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of control transaction 
these provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability of on to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
as a result  these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights 
however  they could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for on s shares 
as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of on common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in the management of on 
on s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by on s stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock allows on to have flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by the on stockholders 
as a result  the market price of the on common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of on common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to others 
on has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
on is subject to the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
the delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including on  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination includes  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving on and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than of on s assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a company and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions 
on has not opted out of the antitakeover provisions of delaware law 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations which may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares in the past  the market price of our common stock has varied greatly and the volume of our common stock traded has fluctuated greatly as well 
we expect such fluctuation to continue 
the fluctuation results from a number of factors including o any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts  o announcements of new products by on or our competitors  o quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of our direct competitors  o changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  the financial performance of our competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general  o general conditions in the software industry  o changes in prices for our products or the products of our competitors  o changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors  o sales of large blocks of the on common stock  and o conditions in the financial markets in general 
in addition  the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many technology companies  in particular  have experienced such fluctuations 
often  such fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
the lower the trading price of our stock  the greater the dilution which shareholders may experience as a result of the issuance of warrants to castle creek technology partners llc and marshall capital management inc 
the number of shares of common stock of the company which must be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued to castle creek technology partners llc and marshall capital management inc is tied to the fluctuating market price of the company s common stock o the lower the trading price of the company s common stock on the effective date of the registration statement filed by the company on form s initially filed on january  and the lower the average trading price for the fifteen trading days preceeding december   the greater the number of shares of common stock that must be issued and the greater the dilution caused by these securities  o the perceived risk of dilution may cause castle creek technology partners llc and marshall capital management inc or other stockholders to sell their shares  which would contribute to the downward movement in stock price of the common stock  and o the significant downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock could encourage investors to engage in short sales  which would further contribute to the downward spiraling price of the common stock 
the issuance of warrants in connection with the private placement transaction on december  may subject on to risk of delisting by nasdaq 
in late january  nasdaq released its guidance on future priced securities and the necessity of on to comply with nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements in issuing these securities 
we believe that the issuance of the warrants to castle creek technology partners llc and marshall capital management inc in connection with the closing of the private placement transaction on december  does not violate these criteria and that we are in compliance with nasdaq s listing maintenance criteria 
however  in the event that nasdaq were to determine that the issuance of the warrants was in violation of the nasdaq listing maintenance requirement  or if we were otherwise unable to continue to meet nasdaq s listing maintenance requirements  nasdaq may delist the company 
such delisting could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the level of liquidity currently available to our shareholders 
we may not be able to satisfy these requirements on an ongoing basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of december   the company did not hold any market risk sensitive instruments
