restaurant sales for increased to million from million in reflecting increased core brand sales which were offset by declining revenues associated with the divestitures of the applebee s and harrigans brands 
in core brands  sales increased to million from million in a full year s sales attributable to the brands acquired in  new unit growth  increased average unit volumes in hops and mccormick schmick s and a week fiscal compared to a week fiscal contributed to the increase in core brand sales

the following discussion of restaurant operating expenses further focuses on the percentages which certain items of expense bear to total restaurant sales for i the company s core brands and ii the company s brands which have been discontinued over the last three fiscal years which include applebee s  harrigans  and hardee s

increased marketing efforts impacted restaurant operating margins primarily at don pablo s and canyon cafe 
don pablo s typically spends approximately of revenue on advertising  compared to total advertising expense of of revenue which was a result of a special fourth quarter winter campaign which increased advertising expense by million 
the fourth quarter program drove customer counts and traffic at the restaurants and helped improve same store sale comparisons from negative in september to positive in december 
the remainder of don pablo s marketing expenses were predominately related to a new summer promotional menu implemented in the second quarter 
in addition to an impact on other operating expenses  the summer promotion resulted in an increase in food and beverage expenses due to a focus on higher cost food items and an increase in payroll and benefit costs resulting from increased labor hours also associated with the menu changes 
marketing expenses at canyon cafe were of revenue in compared to in the increase was due to a combination of increased marketing efforts to develop brand awareness and a decrease in revenue generated by decreases in average unit volumes and restaurant closings 
on a total core brand basis  the increased food and beverage costs at don pablo s were substantially offset by decreases at hops gained through a combination of purchasing contracts for chicken and red meat which stabilized prices during and an increase in the percentage of revenue from beer which has a lower cost 
increases in management labor were predominately attributable to management base pay increases at don pablo s and hops resulting from initiatives implemented in to increase management depth and improve retention rates 
in addition  in hops added the new management position of service specialist to enhance customer service and quality control at each restaurant 
core brand restaurant operating expenses for were of sales compared to in the increase was primarily attributable to a full year of operations related to the brands acquired in which experienced lower margins than the don pablo s brand 
in addition  the following factors also partially contributed to the decrease in margins  i an increase in payroll and benefit costs related to an increase in the number of new unit openings which typically experience higher labor costs during the first several months of operations  ii an increase in food and beverage costs primarily related to an increase in hops sales as a percentage of total core brand sales compared to prior year hops experiences higher food and beverage costs due to a larger percentage of beef sales and a smaller percentage of alcoholic beverage sales as compared to the other brands  iii an increase in other operating expenses related primarily to an increase in advertising in don pablo s and hops and iv other operating costs also associated with an increase in the number of new unit openings coupled with the policy of expensing preopening costs as incurred which was adopted at the beginning of discontinued brands for and  revenues from the company s discontinued brands were solely attributable to applebee s 
in  applebee s accounted for only of the company s consolidated revenues 
decreases in restaurant operating expenses from in to in were attributable to a decrease in preopening and training expenses due to no restaurant openings in compared to applebee s openings in in addition  due to the company s completion of the applebee s divestiture early in  advertising expenditures were substantially reduced from prior year levels 
for  restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of sales for discontinued brands increased to from in the resulting decrease in restaurant operating margins was principally due to increased payroll and benefits resulting from performance based  pay to stay bonus programs implemented to control management turnover and operating costs during the applebee s divestiture period 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses related to core brands were of total core brand sales in compared to in and on a pro forma basis for the decrease was primarily attributable to leverage gained from increases in absolute size at don pablo s  hops and mccormick schmick s 
general and administrative expenses for all brands as a percent of sales were in compared to in and in deleveraging of corporate expenses associated with the sales from the divested applebee s brand was the primary contribution to the change in these rates 
other special charges in  the company recorded a million special charge reflecting fees paid in conjunction with the evaluation of strategic alternatives and other amounts associated with activities to reduce overhead costs  including payroll and employee severance 
in the fourth quarter of  programs were initiated at don pablo s  canyon cafe and the company s corporate headquarters to reorganize management and reduce overhead costs 
a charge of million was recorded  the components of which related primarily to employee termination and severance costs 
interest and other expenses interest expense decreased to million from million in as a result of a decrease in average borrowings outstanding under revolving credit facilities 
this decrease was substantially offset by an increase in interest rates under revolving facilities as well as the senior subordinated notes issued during interest expense in increased to million from million in due to higher average borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
these increased borrowings  related to the construction of new restaurants and the acquisitions  were partially offset by proceeds from various divestitures  a significant portion of which were used to reduce revolving debt obligations 
the company s weighted average interest rate on borrowings was approximately in  in and in gain on disposal of assets primarily reflects the gains recognized on the applebee s divestiture of million in and million in applebee s divestiture gains in both and were offset by net losses incurred on the divestiture of other various assets 
the applebee s divestiture was substantially completed in with the sale of of applebee s locations

the company also holds a percent equity interest in harrigans grill bar restaurants  owned by pinnacle restaurant group  which are currently under contract to be sold to a third party 
the company does not expect to realize a significant gain or loss upon completion of this transaction 
other expenses relate primarily to amortization of goodwill 
other expenses decreased in as a result of an increase in miscellaneous income related predominately to rental income received on various owned properties

net earnings net earnings as a percent of sales was in  in and in the decrease from to and increase from to was primarily a result of the million pre tax gain on disposal of assets held for sale recorded in in addition  the completion of the applebee s divestiture resulted in a decrease in operating income as compared to liquidity and capital resources the company s historical growth and its preference to own the real estate on which its restaurants are situated typically cause it to be a net user of cash  even after a significant amount of expansion financing is internally generated from operations 
based on the current and projected borrowing environment  the company has committed to strategies to reduce its leverage over time 
the extent of projected new restaurant development has been reduced in and  the leasing of new sites to reduce initial capital will take preference over ownership  an aggressive program to realize cash from various non operating assets has been implemented  and other initiatives to reduce leverage are being evaluated 
principal financing sources in consisted of net proceeds of million from the issuance of million  senior subordinated notes due june   proceeds of million from completion of the applebee s divestiture and sale of other assets and cash generated from operations of million 
the principal uses of funds during consisted of capital expenditures of million  treasury stock acquired primarily through the settlement of equity forward agreements of million net of collateral payments on equity forward contracts and net repayment of revolving credit facilities of since substantially all sales in the company s restaurants are for cash and accounts payable are generally due in to days  the company operates with negative working capital 
fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other  accounts payable and accrued liabilities occur as a result of new restaurant openings and the timing of settlement of the company s liabilities 
further increases in prepaid expenses and other from to relate primarily to the reclassification of million in notes receivable from noncurrent to current and new officer loans of million

in  the company completed the private placement of million of senior subordinated notes due june  the notes were priced at to yield 
subsequent to their issuance  the notes were exchanged for identical notes registered under the securities act of simultaneously with the notes offering  a new  three year million bank revolving credit facility was executed

at january   revolving credit agreements aggregated million of which million was unused and available 
terms of the company s notes and revolving credit agreements include various provisions which  among other things  require the company to i maintain defined net worth and coverage ratios  ii limit the incurrence of certain liens or encumbrances in excess of defined amounts  iii maintain defined leverage ratios and iv limit certain payments 
in addition  the revolving credit agreement and notes contain cross default provisions which allow maturity of the notes to be accelerated if the revolving credit agreement maturity is accelerated 
as amended on april   the company was in compliance with the various provisions

the remaining funds are expected to be available under revolving credit facilities expected to be in place as the company completes its evaluation of alternatives to reduce its leverage 
effect of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on earnings during the past several years 
inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operations to offset increases in its operating costs 
various federal and state laws increasing minimum wage rates have been enacted over the past several years 
such legislation  however  has typically frozen the wages of tipped employees at per hour if the difference is earned in tip income 
although the company has experienced slight increases in hourly labor costs in recent years  the effect of increases in minimum wage have been significantly diluted due to the fact that the majority of the company s hourly employees are tipped and the company s non tipped employees have historically earned wages greater than federal and state minimums 
as such  the company s increases in hourly labor costs have not been proportionate to increases in minimum wage rates 
forward looking information certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding the future economic performance and finances  restaurant development plans  capital requirements and objectives of management  is forward looking 
in some cases  information regarding certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any such forward looking statement appear together with such statement 
in addition  the following factors  in addition to other possible factors not listed  could affect the company s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements

other factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements contained in this release and that may affect the company s prospects in general are described in exhibit to the company s form q for the fiscal quarter ended june   and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
year historically  certain computer programs were written and certain computer chips were designed using two digit year designations 
these programs and chips may experience problems handling dates beyond incomplete or untimely resolution of these problems by the company  by its critical suppliers  or by governmental entities could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
work on year related issues began in with executive awareness programs and the engagement of outside consultants to assist in developing a consistent year methodology  time line and project plan 
an inventory and assessment of information technology it systems as well as non it systems was completed during and the solution implementation and testing phases were completed in as the company has invested primarily in licensed software rather than developing it internally  remediation efforts and related expenditures have not been material 
an evaluation of key suppliers to determine the status of their year compliance programs was also completed during and the company has developed contingency plans to address all aspects of operation level functionality and vendor management in the event unforseen circumstances arise 
currently  the company has not experienced and does not anticipate any adverse effects related to year new accounting pronouncements aicpa statement of position  reporting the cost of start up activities was adopted at the beginning of this statement requires entities to expense the costs of start up activities as incurred 
as a result of the adoption of this change in accounting policy  from expensing preopening costs in the first full month of a restaurant s operations to expensing them as incurred  a cumulative effect charge from the change in accounting principle of million million net of tax benefit was recorded in the first quarter of also at the beginning of fiscal  aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use was adopted 
this statement requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations in or also at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which established standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements 
comprehensive income primarily consists of net income and net unrealized gains losses on foreign currency and is presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income 
the statement requires only additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements  it does not affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of sfas no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as amended by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate us libor obligations on revolving credit and interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are utilized to manage overall borrowing costs and reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
three interest rate swap agreements are currently in place under which the company pays an average of certain foreign or us libor based variable rates 
these agreements also contain interest rate caps which further limit interest rate exposures 
if interest rates related to the company s us libor obligations increased by basis points over the rates in effect at january   interest expense for fiscal  after considering the effects of interest rate swap agreements  would increase by approximately million 
if an additional basis point interest rate increase occurred in the company s foreign libor based obligations  interest expense in fiscal would increase by an additional million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate interest rate exposures 
the company purchases certain commodities such as beef  chicken  flour and cooking oil 
purchases of these commodities are generally based on vendor agreements which often contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps 
as commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature and have not historically had a significant impact on operating performance  financial instruments are not used to hedge commodity price risk
