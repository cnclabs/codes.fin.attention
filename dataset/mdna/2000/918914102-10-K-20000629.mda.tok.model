the stockholders of valence are cautioned not to put undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those projected in this report  for the reasons  among others  discussed in the sections management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and risk factors 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes  which are part of this report or incorporated by reference to our reports filed with the commission 
valence undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview valence was founded in to develop and commercialize advanced rechargeable batteries based on lithium and polymer technologies 
since inception  we have been a development stage company primarily engaged in acquiring and developing our initial technology  manufacturing limited quantities of prototype batteries  recruiting personnel  and acquiring capital 
although we currently have three purchase orders of approximately million  to date  other than immaterial revenues from limited sales of batteries and laminate  we have not received any significant revenues from the sale of products 
we will no longer be classified as a development stage company in fiscal substantially all revenues to date have been derived from a research and development contract with the delphi automotive systems group  or delphi  formerly the delco remy division  an operating group of the general motors corporation  which expired in may we have incurred cumulative losses of  from inception to march  results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal research and product development 
research and product development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
research and product development expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the increase in fiscal versus fiscal and fiscal versus fiscal reflects our increased efforts to commercialize our products  including increases in purchasing  machine design engineering  testing  and raw materials for debugging equipment 
marketing 
marketing expenses increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
marketing expenses decreased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of higher travel expenses  the utilization of consultant services  and increased payroll 
the decrease in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of severance payments made to two highly compensated former employees during fiscal no further severance expense was required in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses remained at million for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year march   representing a decrease of 
the fiscal decrease was due to the reduction of payroll  partially offset by compensation expenses of  related to the term extensions of certain vested stock options 
page factory start up costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company started shipping commercial quality grade batteries under an existing purchase order 
the cost of raw materials used to bring the machinery up to production quality  along with related consumables and direct labor  were separated as factory start up costs in the amount of million 
stockholder lawsuit settlement 
as announced on february   a settlement was reached in the securities class action lawsuit that had been pending against the company 
the court approved settlement dismissed all claims against the company and all other defendants without presumption or admission of any liability or wrong doing 
under the terms of the settlement  a payment of million in cash was made  and the company issued  shares of common stock  to the class fund 
the company took an accounting charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal of million or per share for the impact of this settlement 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to  for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
interest and other income increased to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from the fiscal receipt of the final payment from delphi 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to the final payment from delphi offset by decreased investment income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended march   from  for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
interest expense increased to  for the fiscal year ended march   from  for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the increase in fiscal was the result of additional long term debt acquired during the fiscal year  as was the increase in fiscal equity in earnings loss of joint venture 
equity in earnings loss of joint venture decreased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march   representing a decrease of 
equity in earnings loss of joint venture increased to  for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march  the losses in fiscal were primarily the result of unfavorable exchanges in foreign currency 
the earnings in fiscal were primarily the result of favorable exchanges in foreign currency and the losses in fiscal were the result of start up costs for the joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources the company used  net cash for operating activities during fiscal  whereas it used  during fiscal and  during fiscal these respective increases of and resulted from losses incurred with efforts to commercialize the company s products 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing an decrease of 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   representing an increase of 
the usage in fiscal and fiscal was solely the result of continuing capital equipment expenditures 
the company provided million of net cash from financing activities during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal  an increase of million 
the company provided million of net cash from financing activities during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase in fiscal resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the increase in fiscal resulted from the issuance of preferred and common stock  and loans from a principal stockholder 
as a result of the above  the company had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million during fiscal versus decreases of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal year  valence  through its dutch subsidiary  signed an agreement with the northern ireland industrial development board  or idb  to open an automated manufacturing plant in northern ireland in exchange for capital and revenue grants from the idb 
valence also received offers from the idb to receive additional grants 
the grants available under the agreement and offers for an aggregate of up to pound million  generally become page available over a five year period through october  as of march   we had received grants aggregating pound million  reducing remaining grants available to pound million million as of march  
as a condition to receiving funding from the idb  our dutch subsidiary must maintain a minimum of pound million in debt or equity financing from valence 
aggregate funding under the grants was limited to pound  until we had recognized million in aggregate revenue from the sale of our batteries produced in northern ireland 
an amendment to the agreement with the idb permits valence to receive pound  approximately  after achieving sales of batteries manufactured by the northern ireland operation of at least million 
an additional pound  is available when the total related sales reach million 
the amount of the grants available under the agreement and offers depends primarily on the level of capital expenditures that we make 
substantially all of the funding received under the grants is repayable to the idb if the subsidiary is in default under the agreement and offers  which includes the permanent cessation of business in northern ireland 
funding received under the grants to offset capital expenditures is repayable if related equipment is sold  transferred or otherwise disposed of during a four year period after the date of grant 
in addition  a portion of funding received under the grants may also be repayable if the subsidiary fails to maintain specified employment levels for the two year period immediately after the end of the five year grant period 
we have guaranteed the dutch subsidiary s obligations to the idb under the agreement 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to meet the requirements necessary for us to receive and retain grants under the idb agreement and offers 
the major components of construction in progress with their estimated costs and start dates are as follows extraction  packaging  and conditioning equipment  million  august  assembly equipment  million  march  mixing  coating  etching  laminating and slitting equipment  million  march  and factory improvements and miscellaneous equipment   june the estimated completion date for these major categories of construction in progress is july these statements are forward looking statements  and actual costs and completion dates are subject to change due to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including the availability of funds for completion  the risk that actual costs will be materially greater due to unforeseen difficulties in completion of the projects  reliance on manufacturers to deliver equipment in a timely manner and that performs as intended  and other risks and uncertainties 
during october  castle creek investments  ldc elected to convert all  shares of their series a convertible participating preferred stock 
these  shares of series a stock  including the accreted redemption value through the date of conversion  converted to million shares of our common stock 
in october  we obtained a loan in the amount of million from a major stockholder 
the loan is in the form of a demand note such that the holder can request payment after january  or convert the loan and accrued interest to common stock 
the conversion rate is per share  which equals the ten day average closing sale price prior to the loan date 
the interest rate is per annum 
in october  november and december  we sold an aggregate of million shares of our common stock to institutional investors  raising aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we estimate that the total expenses incurred in connection with the sale of shares in october  november and december  including finders fees and legal and accounting fees  were approximately million 
on november   castle creek elected to convert  shares of their series b convertible participating preferred stock 
these  shares of series b stock  including the accreted redemption value through the date of conversion  converted to  shares of our common stock 
during june the company entered into separate private placement funding arrangements with acqua wellington value fund ltd 
acqua wellington  an institutional investor  and carl e 
berg mr 
berg  a principal stockholder and director of the company  for an equity investment commitment totaling million 
acqua wellington funded million on june th by the purchase of  shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares  exercisable at per share 
the remaining million is in the form of a binding commitment from mr 
berg for funding through the fiscal year end 
the draw down of this berg commitment is at the company s option 
the shares to be issued under these commitments will be restricted shares 
only the institutional investor has registration rights on its shares 
the company has agreed to file a registration statement with respect to the acqua wellington shares  to be effective within days of closing 
page since inception  we have experienced significant losses and negative cash flow from operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from our operating activities and available financing will be sufficient to fund our minimum working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal if in the future we do not have sufficient cash to finance our operations  we may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all 
year to date  we have not experienced any material failures of any of our systems related to the failure of year compliance 
in addition  to date  we have not been made aware of any year compliance failures involving our customers and suppliers 
to date  we have spent an immaterial amount on the compliance program  and we do not expect to incur any material additional amounts 
the costs discussed above do not include our internal costs  including the payroll costs for those persons working on our year compliance project  which costs we do not track 
risk factors cautionary statements and risk factors several of the matters discussed in this document contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecast are included in the statements below 
in addition to other information contained in this report  you should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
risks related to our business we are in the early stages of manufacturing  and our failure to develop the ability to efficiently manufacture batteries in commercial quantities which satisfy our customers product specifications could damage our customer relationships and result in significant lost business opportunities for us 
to be successful  we must cost effectively manufacture commercial quantities of our batteries that meet customer specifications 
until recently  our batteries only had been manufactured on our pilot manufacturing line  which is able to produce prototype batteries in quantities sufficient to enable customer sampling and testing and product development 
our manufacturing facilities will require additional development to enable us to produce batteries cost effectively  according to customer specifications and on a commercial scale 
to facilitate commercialization of our products  we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs 
this includes being able to substantially raise and maintain battery yields of commercial quality in a cost effective manner 
failure to achieve substantially increased yields of our batteries and to reduce unit manufacturing costs will preclude us from offering our batteries at a competitive price to the market  which would impair our ability to attract current and future customers 
page we are currently in the early stages of transitioning production to an automated production line that will work with our newest battery technology in our manufacturing facility in mallusk  northern ireland 
we have begun to manufacture batteries on a commercial scale to fulfill our first significant purchase orders 
the redesign and modification of the mallusk manufacturing facility  including its customized manufacturing equipment  will continue to require substantial engineering work and capital expenses and is subject to significant risks  including risks of cost overruns and significant delays 
in addition  in order to scale up the manufacturing capacity  we will need to begin qualification of additional automated production lines 
in automating  redesigning and modifying the manufacturing processes  we have been  and will continue to depend on  several developers of automated production lines  all of whom have limited experience in producing equipment for the manufacture of batteries 
a failure to successfully develop and implement a large scale manufacturing facility capable of cost effectively producing commercial quantities of batteries and according to customer specifications would harm our ability to serve the needs of our customers and threaten our future sales and profits 
as part of our manufacturing ramp up  we will need to hire and train a substantial number of new manufacturing workers 
the availability of skilled and unskilled workers in northern ireland  the site of our manufacturing facility  is limited due to a relatively low unemployment rate 
as a result  we face the risk that we may not o successfully hire and train the new manufacturing workers necessary for the ramp up of our mallusk  northern ireland manufacturing facility  o successfully develop improved processes  o design required production equipment  o enter into acceptable contracts for the fabrication of required production equipment  o obtain timely delivery of required production equipment  o implement multiple production lines  or o successfully operate the mallusk facility 
our failure to successfully automate our production on a timely basis  if at all  could damage our reputation  relationships with future and existing customers  cause us to lose business and potentially prevent us from establishing the commercial viability of our products 
if we continue to experience delays in qualifying our manufacturing facilities  this could significantly delay our bringing commercial quantities of product to market and interfere with our ability to generate the revenue and cash that we need to sustain our business 
we may be unable to meet our schedules regarding delivery  installation  de bugging and qualification of our northern ireland facility production equipment  and face the prospect of further delays or problems related to facility qualification because o most of the production equipment is being specifically manufactured for us  thus  delays may occur since the design and delivery of this equipment is not within our control  o through our laboratory scale prototype work  we are modifying and bringing many of the manufacturing processes that we are implementing in this production equipment up to date for the first time and may need to refine these processes  which could cause delays  o even if we are able to refine our process  we may not be able to produce the amount of qualification samples required by our customers  and o our customers generally require an extensive qualification period once they receive their first commercial product off a production line 
any qualification related delays or problems would impair our ability to bring our batteries to market and would harm our business by adversely affecting revenue growth and our cash position 
any extended delays in bringing our products to market could harm our competitive position and harm our economic growth 
our limited ability to manufacture large volumes of batteries may prevent us from fulfilling existing orders which may harm our business 
we currently have three outstanding unfilled purchase orders for our batteries and are actively soliciting additional purchase orders 
we presently have limited quantities of batteries available for sale and do not currently have the necessary equipment in operation to manufacture a commercially adequate volume of products 
in  we were ultimately unable to fulfill a purchase order for batteries which incorporated a previous technology due to our inability to produce our batteries on a commercial scale 
if we cannot rapidly increase our production capabilities to make sufficient quantities of commercially acceptable batteries  we may not be able to fulfill existing purchase page orders in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  we may not be able to procure additional purchase orders  which could cause us to lose existing and future customers  purchase orders  revenue and profits 
we may have a need for additonal capital we may have a need for additional capital 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  after taking into account our cash and cash equivalents  projected revenues and receipt of funds from other sources  we may need to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing through fiscal to complete funding of planned capital expansion  research and product development  marketing and general and administrative expenses and to pursue joint venture and other business opportunities 
our cash requirements  however may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including changes in original equipment manufacturer oem relationships or market conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional funds for these purposes  whether from equity or debt financing agreements  will available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we need capital and cannot raise additional funds  it may delay further development and production of our batteries or otherwise delay our execution of our business plan  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we have a history of losses  have an accumulated deficit and may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception in and had an accumulated deficit of  as of march  we have working capital of million as of march   and have sustained recurring losses related primarily to the research and development and marketing of our products 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows through fiscal  as we continue our product development  begin to build inventory and continue our marketing efforts 
we may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability in the future 
if our batteries fail to perform as expected  we could lose existing and future business  and our long term ability to market and sell our batteries could be harmed 
if we manufacture our batteries in commercial quantities and they fail to perform as expected  our reputation could be severely damaged  and we could lose existing or potential future business 
even if the defect were corrected  this performance failure might have the long term effect of harming our ability to market and sell our batteries 
because we depend on a small number of customers for our revenues  our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we were to lose the business of any one of these customers 
to date  our three existing purchase orders in commercial quantities are from two customers 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers  and do not expect to enter into any long term agreements in the near future 
as a result  we face the substantial risk that any of the following events could occur o reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from a customer  o development by a customer of other sources of supply  o selection by a customer of devices manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  o loss of a customer or a disruption in our sales and distribution channels  and o failure of a customer to make timely payment of our invoices 
if we were to lose one or more customers  or if we were to lose revenues due to a customer s inability or refusal to continue to purchase our batteries  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
we are involved in a lawsuit that could result in payments of damage awards or settlements that could have an adverse effect on our cash resources and our financial condition 
we are currently involved in a lawsuit involving a contract claim that we instituted against several parties 
one defendant has filed a counterclaim against valence and third parties claiming damages of approximately  based on a theory of breach of contract 
in april  we prevailed on a motion for summary adjudication against one of the defendant s claims for oral modification  promissory estoppel  and fraud 
the remaining issues currently are being tried in a jury trial 
although we intend to defend vigorously the claims against us  if the lawsuit is resolved unfavorably to us or if we choose to settle the lawsuit  we may be required to pay substantial monetary damages  which would adversely affect our cash flows  and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to expand our employee base and operations in order to distribute our products commercially  which may strain our management and resources and could harm our business 
during  we grew rapidly  expanding our manufacturing capacity significantly 
we have grown from employees at march to employees as of may we plan to expand our manufacturing capability in the next six months by adding more equipment 
we plan to expand our sales and marketing organizations in addition to increasing the number of manufacturing employees and adding to our operating team 
to implement our growth strategy successfully  we will have to increase our staff  including personnel in sales and marketing  engineering  development and product support capabilities  as well as third party and direct distribution channels 
however  we face the risk that we may not be able to attract new employees to sufficiently increase our staff or product support capabilities  or that we will not be successful in our sales and marketing efforts 
failure in any of these areas could impair our ability to execute our plans for growth and adversely affect our future profitability 
page competition for personnel  in particular for product development and product implementation personnel  is intense  and we may have difficulty attracting the personnel necessary to effectively operate our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel who are familiar with and experienced in the battery industry  as well as skilled personnel to operate our facility in northern ireland 
if we cannot attract and retain experienced sales and marketing executives  we may not achieve the visibility in the marketplace that we need to obtain purchase orders  which would have the result of lowering our sales and earnings 
we compete in the market for personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established competitors with significantly greater financial resources than us 
we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel in the past  and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business effectively in the future 
because our batteries are primarily sold to be incorporated into other products  we rely on original equipment manufacturers and battery pack assemblers to commercialize our products 
we may not obtain adequate assistance from these third parties to successfully commercialize our products 
we rely heavily on assistance in gaining market acceptance for our products from original equipment manufacturers  or oems  manufacturers who produce complex equipment from components usually bought from other manufacturers and battery pack assemblers who incorporate our batteries into products that they later sell to commercial manufacturers or the public 
we will therefore need to meet these companies requirements by developing and introducing on a timely basis  new products and enhanced  or modified  versions of our existing products 
oems and battery pack assemblers often require unique configurations or custom designs for batteries  which must be developed and integrated into their product well before the product is launched 
this development process not only requires substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized battery system and the commencement of volume shipments of the battery system to the customer  but also requires the cooperation and assistance of the oems or battery pack assemblers for purposes of determining the battery requirements for each specific application 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce products that meet original equipment manufacturers and battery pack assemblers requirements  we may not be able to fulfill our obligations under existing purchase orders  we may lose opportunities to enter into additional purchase orders and our reputation may be damaged 
as a result  we may not receive adequate assistance from oems or battery pack assemblers to successfully commercialize our products  which could impair our profitability 
we depend on a sole source supplier for our anode raw materials  and utilize a limited number of suppliers for other key raw materials that we use in developing and manufacturing our batteries 
if we cannot obtain necessary raw materials  our production of batteries will be delayed 
we depend on a sole source supplier for our anode  or negative electrode  raw material 
in addition  we utilize a limited number of suppliers for other key raw materials used in manufacturing and developing our batteries 
we generally purchase raw materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time and have no long term contracts or other guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers 
as a result  we face the following risks relating to our supply of raw materials necessary for operating our business o our suppliers may not be able to meet our requirements relative to specifications and volumes for key raw materials  and we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply at an acceptable cost  and o we have in the past experienced delays in product development due to the delivery of nonconforming raw materials from our suppliers  and if in the future we are unable to obtain high quality raw materials in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  our production of batteries may be delayed 
any loss  delay or failure in obtaining key raw materials could impede our ability to fulfill existing or future purchase orders and harm our reputation and profitability 
if our batteries or our customers applications that incorporate our batteries do not achieve lasting market acceptance  we may lose potential customers 
to achieve market acceptance  our batteries must offer significant performance or other measurable advantages at a cost effective rate as compared to other current and potential alternative battery technologies in a broad range of page applications 
our batteries may not be able to achieve or sustain these advantages 
even if our batteries provide meaningful price or performance advantages  there is a risk our batteries may not be able to achieve or maintain market acceptance in any potential market application 
the success of our products also will depend upon the level of market acceptance of oems and other customers end products that incorporate our batteries  a circumstance over which we have little or no control 
our ability to realize these performance advantages and our failure to achieve significant market acceptance with our products could hurt our ability to attract customers in the future 
we have four key executives 
the loss of a single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
our success is highly dependent upon the active participation of four key executives 
we do not have written employment contracts or key man life insurance policies with respect to any of these key members of management 
without qualified executives  we face the risk that we will not be able to effectively run our business on a day to day basis or execute our long term business plan 
if we cannot protect or enforce our existing intellectual property rights or if our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents  we may lose the advantages of our research and manufacturing systems 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can protect our existing proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and cross licensing agreements 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our batteries 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their non disclosure agreements with us  and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of their breaches 
in addition  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
moreover  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights outside of the united states 
we have established a program for intellectual property documentation and protection in order to safeguard our technology base 
we intend to vigorously pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and our other proprietary rights 
we could incur significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could harm our financial condition 
we are also attempting to expand our intellectual property rights through our applications for new patents 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until the patents that are applied for are ultimately issued 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
therefore  our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and our issued patents may not afford protection against a competitor 
our failure to protect our existing proprietary technologies or to develop new proprietary technologies may substantially impair our financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in these proceedings in the future 
in the future we may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding page our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling  incorporating or using our product that use the challenged intellectual property  o pay significant damages to third parties  o obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or o redesign those products or manufacturing processes that use the infringed technology  which may be economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could be expensive and harm our business 
our batteries contain potentially dangerous materials  which could expose us to product liability claims 
in the event of a short circuit or other physical damage to a battery  a reaction may result with excess heat or a gas being generated and released 
if the heat or gas is not properly released  the battery may be flammable or potentially explosive 
our batteries that were based on an earlier technology  have  in the past  smoked  caught fire and vented gas 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to reduce these risks in our current design  we could be exposed to product liability litigation 
in addition  our batteries incorporate potentially dangerous materials  including lithium 
it is possible that these materials may require special handling or that safety problems may develop in the future 
we are aware that if the amounts of active materials in our batteries are not properly balanced and if the charge discharge system is not properly managed  a dangerous situation may result 
other battery manufacturers using technology similar to ours include special safety circuitry within the battery to prevent such a dangerous condition 
we expect that our customers will have to use a similar type of circuitry in connection with their use of our products 
we are engaged in ongoing safety testing of our batteries to meet customer requirements and may not be able to increase commercial sales of our batteries if our products are not successful in these tests 
we have conducted safety testing of our batteries and have submitted batteries to underwriters laboratories for certification  which is required by a number of oems prior to placing a purchase order with us 
underwriters laboratories has granted a preliminary acceptance of an earlier generation of our batteries  pending a manufacturing site audit 
those batteries  while similar to the batteries we are selling today  are not of the current design and composition 
our current batteries must be submitted for underwriters laboratories approval  and underwriters laboratories has not yet begun a scheduled audit of our northern ireland manufacturing facility 
as part of our safety testing program  prototype batteries of various sizes  designs and chemical formulations are subject to abuse testing  in which the battery is subjected to conditions outside expected normal operating conditions 
each new battery design will continue to require new safety testing 
in addition  safety problems may develop with respect to our current and future battery technology that could prevent or delay commercial introduction of our products 
accidents at our facilities could delay production and adversely affect our operations 
an accident in our facilities could occur 
any accident  whether due to the production of our batteries or otherwise resulting from our facilities operations  could result in significant manufacturing delays or claims for damages resulting from personal or property injuries  which would adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we depend upon the continued operation of a single manufacturing facility 
operational problems at this facility could harm our business 
our revenues are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in northern ireland 
the operation of a manufacturing plant involves many risks  including potential damage from fire or natural disasters 
in addition  we have obtained permits to conduct our business as currently operated at the facility 
there can be no assurance that these permits would continue to be effective at the current location if the facility were destroyed and page rebuilt  or that we would be able to obtain similar permits to operate at another location 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our northern ireland facility would not harm our business 
we do not fully control the operation of our joint ventures operations  strategies and financial decisions  and we cannot assure you that our products will be marketed successfully through these ventures 
at the present time  we have investment interests in two operating joint ventures 
we established a joint venture company in korea  hanil valence co  ltd  to manufacture  package and distribute advanced rechargeable solid polymer batteries 
we supply hanil valence co 
with its proprietary laminates film and laminate materials  from which hanil valence co 
will manufacture batteries for the korean market 
in addition  we will supply technology  initial equipment and product designs and technical support for the hanil valence co 
joint venture out of our northern ireland facility 
we cannot be certain that the hanil valence co 
joint venture will be profitable  and if this joint venture does not remain in business  we would need to find other business partners and or contract with third parties for purposes of manufacturing  selling and distributing rechargeable batteries in the korean market 
we also established a joint venture company  alliant valence  llc  to market our battery technology and technology obtained under our non exclusive license with telecordia technologies formerly bellcore and to develop and to manufacture batteries for our us military customers  as well as for foreign military sales activities 
in connection with this joint venture  alliant power sources company  an alliant operating company  has ordered both battery component material and finished battery cells from valence to be used in the construction of several different specialized batteries for military and aerospace applications 
we do not control or manage either of these joint ventures 
consequently  we must rely on the management skills of our venture partners to successfully operate these ventures 
our joint venture partners may have economic  businesses or legal interests or goals that conflict with ours 
in addition  we may have significant disagreements with our venture partners regarding strategic or operational issues that could have material adverse effect on the ventures business or financial conditions 
we may be required to fulfill the obligations of our joint venture partners if they are unable to meet their obligations 
we also depend to a significant degree on local partners in our joint ventures to provide us with regulatory and marketing expertise and familiarity with the local business environment 
any disruption in our relationship with these parties could make it more difficult to market our products in the geographic regions or to the customers to which the joint venture relates 
unsuccessful ventures could also significantly damage our reputation  making it more difficult to obtain purchase orders for our batteries 
we do not have a collaborative partner to assist us in development of our batteries  which may limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
the use of alliances for our development  product design  volume purchase and manufacturing and marketing expertise could reduce the need for development and use of internal resources 
we have received substantially all our revenues to date from a research and development agreement for joint development in the automotive market with delphi automotive systems group  which we completed in may although we have held discussions with oems in the portable consumer electronics and telecommunications markets about possible strategic relationships as a means to accelerate introduction of our batteries into these markets  we may choose not to  or may not be able to  enter into any such alliances 
further  even if we could collaborate with a desirable partner  the partnership may not be successful 
the success of any strategic alliance that we may enter into depends on  among other things  the general business condition of the partner  its commitment to the strategic alliance and the skills and experience of its employees 
without a collaborative partner to assist us in development of our batteries  our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be limited 
we expect to sell a significant portion of our products to customers located outside the united states 
foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our future profitability 
the largest of our initial product orders is with an international customer 
we expect that international sales will represent an increasingly significant portion of our product sales 
international sales can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including page o changes in foreign government regulations and technical standards  including additional regulation of rechargeable batteries or the transport of lithium  which may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  o foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our batteries  o requirements or preferences of foreign nations for domestic products could reduce demand for our batteries  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar could make our batteries unaffordable to foreign purchasers or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the future profitability of foreign sales  o import and export licensing requirements in northern ireland or korea may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets  and o political and economic instability in northern ireland or korea may reduce the demand for our batteries or our ability to market our batteries in foreign countries 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales or future profitability 
political instability in northern ireland could interrupt manufacturing of our batteries at our northern ireland facility and cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities 
northern ireland has experienced significant social and political unrest in the past and we cannot assure you that these instabilities will not continue in the future 
any political instability in northern ireland could temporarily or permanently interrupt our manufacturing of batteries at our facility in mallusk  northern ireland 
any delays could also cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities  as potential customers would find other vendors to meet their needs 
risks associated with our industry there has been  and continues to be  a rapid evolution of battery technologies 
if competing technologies that outperform our batteries were developed and successfully introduced  then our products might not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
the battery industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  rapid technological change 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
various companies are seeking to enhance traditional battery technologies  such as lead acid and nickel cadmium 
other companies have recently introduced or are developing batteries based on nickel metal hydride  liquid lithium ion and other emerging and potential technologies 
these competitors are engaged in significant development work on these various battery systems and we believe that much of this effort is focused on achieving higher energy densities for low power applications such as portable electronics 
one or more new  higher energy rechargeable battery technologies could be introduced which could be directly competitive with  or be superior to  our technology 
the capabilities of many of these competing technologies have improved over the past several years 
competing technologies that outperform our batteries could be developed and successfully introduced and  as a result  there is a risk that our products may not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
our principal competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and they may therefore develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do 
competition in the rechargeable battery industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  most of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
there is a risk that other companies may develop batteries similar or superior to ours 
in addition  many of these companies have name recognition  established positions in the market  page and long standing relationships with oems and other customers 
we believe that our primary competitors are existing suppliers of liquid lithium ion  competing polymer and  in some cases  nickel metal hydride batteries 
these suppliers include sanyo  matsushita industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  sony  toshiba and saft america  inc all of these companies are very large and have substantial resources and market presence 
we expect that we will compete against manufacturers of other types of batteries in our targeted application segments  which include laptops  cellular telephones and personal digital assistant products  on the basis of performance  size and shape  cost and ease of recycling 
there is also a risk that we may not be able to compete successfully against manufacturers of other types of batteries in any of our targeted applications 
laws regulating the manufacture or transport of batteries may be enacted which could result in a delay in the production of our batteries or the imposition of additional costs that would harm our ability to be profitable 
at the present time  international  federal  state or local law does not directly regulate the storage  use and disposal of the component parts of our batteries or the transport of our batteries 
however  laws and regulations may be enacted in the future which could impose environmental  health and safety controls on the storage  use  and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium polymer batteries as well as regulations governing the transport of our batteries 
satisfying any future laws or regulations could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and possible redesign which may result in substantial expenditures and delays in the production of our product  all of which could harm our business and reduce our future profitability 
general risks associated with stock ownership corporate insiders or affiliates will be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval that might not be in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole 
as of may   our officers  directors  and their affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
carl berg  one of our directors  owns a substantial portion of that amount 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interest of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as stockholders  may lead them to o vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or o oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as shareholders per se and thus from the interests of other shareholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and limit the price potential acquirers may be willing to pay for your shares 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the stockholders  to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to those of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of our capital stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may decrease the market price  and infringe upon the voting and other rights of the holders  of our common stock 
conversion of preferred stock and sales of common stock by cc investments may depress the price of our common stock and substantially dilute your stock 
if cc investments ldc cc investments were to exercise all of the warrants it holds and convert all of the shares of preferred stock it owns  as of june   it would then own approximately  shares of our common stock 
this amount includes  shares of our common stock that cc investments would acquire upon their conversion of the shares of series b preferred stock it currently holds 
our series b preferred stock has a variable conversion rate page and is convertible into a larger amount of shares when our common stock trades at a price below in six out of ten consecutive trading days 
in addition  the number of shares into which the preferred stock converts increases at per year 
if cc investments exercises additional warrants or converts its preferred stock into shares of our common stock and sells the shares into the market  these sales could depress the market price of our common stock and would dilute your holdings in our common stock 
additionally  dilution or the potential for dilution could harm our ability to raise capital through the future sale of equity securities 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock include the following o fluctuation in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  o failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  o governmental regulation  o developments in our patent or other proprietary rights or our competitors developments  o our relationships with current or future collaborative partners  and o other factors and events beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
as a result of this potential stock price volatility  investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the cost of their purchase prices 
in addition  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  this could result in substantial costs  a diversion of our management s attention and resources and harm to our business and financial condition 
future sales of currently outstanding shares could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or in response to the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of the filing date of this report  we had outstanding  shares of common stock  based upon shares outstanding as of may   and the conversion of all of our series b preferred stock 
of these shares  most will be registered and freely tradable 
included in these shares are  shares issued to a wholly owned subsidiary  which pledged these shares to secure our obligations in accordance with the settlement of a class action lawsuit 
on may   the court approved the parties settlement agreement for this class action lawsuit and issued and order formally dismissing the case 
under the terms of the settlement  the plaintiffs settlement counsel  or their authorized agents  acting on behalf of the settlement class and subject to the supervision and direction of the court  will administer and calculate the claims submitted by the settlement class members and will oversee distribution of the balance of the settlement fund to the authorized claimants as of the effective date of the settlement 
the settlement fund will be applied in the following order a to pay counsel to the representative plaintiffs attorneys fees the fee and expense award as defined in the settlement and if and to the extent allowed by the court  b to pay all costs and expenses reasonably and actually incurred in connection with providing notice ie locating class members  c to pay the taxes and tax expenses as described in the settlement agreement  and d to distribute the balance of the settlement fund to authorized claimants as allowed by the terms of the settlement  the court or the plan of allocation as defined in the settlement 
in addition  we have filed registration statements on form s under the securities act of that cover  shares of common stock pursuant to outstanding but unexercised vested options to acquire our common stock 
page we do not intend to pay dividends and therefore you will only be able to recover your investment in our common stock  if at all  by selling the shares of our stock that you hold 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on an investment in our shares likely depends on your ability to sell our stock at a profit
