such assessments generally consisted of a visual inspection of the properties  review of federal and state environmental databases and certain information regarding historic uses of the property and adjacent areas and the preparation and issuance of written reports 
some of the properties contain  or contained  underground storage tanks ust s used for storing petroleum products or wastes typically associated with automobile service or other operations conducted at the properties

at certain properties  where warranted by the conditions  the company has developed and implemented an operations and maintenance program that establishes operating procedures with respect to acms 
the costs associated with the development and implementation for such programs were not material 
although there can be no assurances that such environmental liability does not exist  other than parkway place in huntsville  alabama  none of the environmental assessments have identified and the company is not aware of any environmental liability with respect to the properties in which the company or the operating partnership has or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that the company believes would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
nevertheless  it is possible that the environmental assessments available to the company do not reveal all potential environmental liabilities  that subsequent investigations will identify material contamination  that adverse environmental conditions have arisen subsequent to the performance of the environmental assessments  or that there are material environmental liabilities of which management is unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of the properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the properties or by third parties unrelated to the company  the operating partnership or the relevant property partnership

the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
general risks of the company s business general factors affecting investments in shopping center properties and effect of economic and real estate conditions a shopping center s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national and regional economic climates  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of retail space  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and the willingness and ability of the shopping center s owner to provide capable management and maintenance services 
in addition  other factors may adversely affect a shopping center s value without affecting its current revenues  including changes in governmental regulations  zoning or tax laws  potential environmental or other legal liabilities  availability of financing  and changes in interest rate levels 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distribution to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders 
geographic concentration the properties are located principally in the southeastern united states in alabama  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
twenty malls  fourteen associated centers  sixty four community centers and the office building are located in these states 
the company s results of operations and funds available for distribution to stockholders therefore will be subject generally to economic conditions in the southeastern united states 
as of december   the properties located in the southeastern united states accounted for of the company s total assets  and provided of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  third party interests in certain properties the operating partnership owns partial interests in seven malls  five associated centers  one community center  the office building and one mall under development 
the operating partnership or an affiliate of the company is the managing general partner of the property partnerships that own such properties  except for the governor s square mall and its associated center  governor s plaza  in which affiliates of the operating partnership are non managing general partners 
where the operating partnership serves as managing general partner of property partnerships  it may have certain fiduciary responsibilities to the other partners in those partnerships 
in certain cases  the approval or consent of the other partners is required before the operating partnership may sell  finance  expand or make other significant changes in the operations of such properties 
to the extent such approvals or consents are required  the operating partnership may experience difficulty in  or may be prevented from implementing its plans with respect to expansion  development  financing or other similar transactions with respect to such properties 
with respect to governor s square and governor s plaza  the operating partnership does not have day to day operational control or control over certain major decisions  including the timing and amount of distributions and decisions relating to sales  expansions and financings  which could result in decisions by the managing general partner that do not fully reflect the interests of the company  including decisions relating to the standards that the company is required to satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust for tax purposes 
dependence on significant properties hamilton place in chattanooga  tennessee and burnsville center in minneapolis burnsville  minnesota accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total revenues of the company for the period ended december  the company s financial position and results of operations will therefore be disproportionately affected by the results experienced at these properties

the company s strategy for growth management believes that per share growth in the company s funds from operations  as defined below  is one of the key factors in enhancing shareholder value 
management also believes that funds from operations is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits  and its consistent determination provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
it is the objective of the company s management to achieve growth in funds from operations through the aggressive management of the company s existing properties  the expansion and renovation of existing properties  the development of new properties  and select acquisitions 
funds from operations can also be affected by external factors  such as inflation  fluctuations in interest rates or changes in general economic conditions  which are beyond the control of the company s management 
funds from operations is defined by the company as net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items  gains or losses on sales of real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has amended the definition of funds from operations so that the write off of development costs will no longer be added back in the calculation to be effective beginning january 
the company will comply with the amended definition 
the cost of interest rate caps and finance costs on the company s lines of credit are amortized and included in interest expense and  therefore  reduces funds from operations 
funds from operations also includes the company s share of funds from operations in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of funds from operations in consolidated properties 
the company excludes outparcel sales from its funds from operations calculation  even though the nareit definition allows their inclusion 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principals gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available from operations to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company classifies its regional malls into two categories stabilized malls stabilized malls which have completed their initial lease up and new malls new malls which are in their initial lease up phase or are being redeveloped 
at year end the new mall category was comprised of springdale mall in mobile  alabama which was acquired in september and which is being redeveloped and retenanted  bonita lakes mall in meridian  mississippi which opened in october  parkway place mall in huntsville  alabama which was acquired in december  and which is being redeveloped and arbor place in atlanta douglasville  georgia  which opened in october specifically  the company has implemented its objective of growing its funds from operations and will continue to do so by maximizing the cash flow from its existing portfolio of malls  associated centers and community centers  and other retail complexes through aggressive leasing  management  and marketing  including an active leasing strategy which seeks to increase occupancy 
at december   the occupancy at the stabilized malls  new malls  associated centers  and community centers was    and  respectively  as compared to occupancies of    and  respectively  at december  expanded merchandising  marketing and promotional activities  with the goal of enhancing tenant sales and thereby increasing percentage rents 
mall store sales per square foot for the year ended december  were higher at the stabilized malls than for the year ended december   increased base rents as tenant leases expire  renegotiation of leases and negotiation of terminations of leases of under performing retailers 
at december  average base rents per square foot at the malls  associated centers  and community centers was   and  respectively  as compared to average base rents per square foot of   and  respectively  at december   control of operating costs 
occupancy costs as a percentage of sales at the stabilized malls remained relatively stable at excluding acquisition malls from year of acquisition for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  expanding and renovating existing properties to maintain their competitive position 
most of the malls were designed to allow for expansion and growth through the addition of new department stores or other large retail stores as anchors anchors 
twenty four of the thirty malls have undergone expansion or renovation since their opening  and all of the non acquired malls have been either built or renovated in the last years 
two of the malls had available anchor pads at december  twenty existing anchors at eleven malls have expansion potential at their existing stores 
during  the company renovated college square in morristown  tennessee  governor s square in clarksville  tennessee and rivergate mall in nashville  tennessee and expanded lakeshore mall in sebring  florida adding sears as the fifth department store 
in the community center and associated center portfolios  the company renovated six community centers  began expansion of one community center and renovated two associated center in in  the company plans to renovate at least four community centers 
developing new retail properties with profitable returns on capital  leading to growth in the future 
during  the company began the expansion of asheville mall in asheville  north carolina and plans to renovate it in in  the company opened one mall  one associated center  three community centers and one expansion center

the company opened the expansion in february  wal mart opened in february and home depot will open in may in addition to the construction properties as of march   the company was pursuing the development of a number of sites which the company believes are viable for future development as malls and community and neighborhood shopping centers 
regional mall development sites were being pursued in georgia  mississippi and south carolina and a redevelopment of parkway place in huntsville  alabama and community shopping center sites were being pursued in georgia  florida  massachusetts  pennsylvania and virginia 
in general  the company seeks out development opportunities in middle market trade areas that it believes are under serviced by existing retail facilities  have demonstrated improving demographic trends or otherwise afford an opportunity for effective market penetration and competitive presence 
acquiring existing retail properties where cash flow can be enhanced by improved management  leasing  redevelopment and expansion 
management believes that an opportunity for growth exists through the acquisition of shopping centers that meet the company s investment criteria and targeted returns 
in general  the company seeks to acquire well located shopping centers in middle market geographic areas consistent with management s experience where management believes significant value can be created through its development  leasing and management expertise 
in july  the company acquired york galleria in york  pennsylvania 
the purchase price was funded from a mortgage loan in the amount of million and in part from million in proceeds from the company s dispositions of two department stores and two free standing community centers 
risks associated with the company s growth strategy in connection with the implementation of this growth strategy  the company and the operating partnership will incur various risks including the risk that development or expansion opportunities explored by the company and the operating partnership may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project not profitable  the risk that the company and the operating partnership may not be able to refinance construction loans which are generally with full recourse to the company and the operating partnership  the risk that occupancy rates and rents at a completed project will not meet projections  and will therefore be insufficient to make the project profitable  and the need for anchor  mortgage lender and property partner approvals for certain expansion activities 
in the event of an unsuccessful development project  the company s and the operating partnership s loss could exceed its investment in the project 
the company has in the past elected not to proceed with certain development projects and anticipates that it will do so again from time to time in the future 
if the company elects not to proceed with a development opportunity  the development costs associated therewith ordinarily will be charged against income for the then current period 
any such charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken 
competition there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
the malls are generally located in middle markets 
management believes that the malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only or largest enclosed malls within their respective trade areas 
in addition  retailers at the properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  outlet malls  wholesale clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition could adversely affect the operating partnership s revenues and funds available for distributions to partners  which in turn will affect the company s revenues and funds available for distribution to stockholders 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature with tenant sales achieving the highest levels during the fourth quarter because of the holiday season 
the malls earn most of their temporary rents rents from short term tenants during the holiday period 
thus  occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the entire year 
qualification as a real estate investment trust the company has elected to be taxed as real estate investment trust under the code  commencing with its taxable year ended december   and will seek to maintain such status 
as a qualified real estate investment trust  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes at least of its current year real estate investment trust taxable income to its shareholders 
beginning on january  the company s first taxable year beginning after december   this percentage is reduced to 
if the company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
insurance the operating partnership carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance covering all the properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
management believes that the properties are adequately insured in accordance with industry standards

each mall generally has at least three anchors which own or lease their stores and numerous non anchor stores with gla less than  square feet mall stores  most of which are national or regional retailers  located along enclosed malls connecting the anchors 
at most of the malls  additional freestanding restaurants and retail stores are located on the periphery of the mall complex 
these freestanding stores are  in most cases  owned by their occupants 
thirteen of the mall complexes include one or more associated centers 
the total gla of the malls is approximately million square feet or an average gla of approximately  square feet per mall 
mall store gla is  square feet including leased free standing buildings at december  the company wholly owns all but seven of its malls and manages all but one of them 
in the years ended december   and  mall revenues represented approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues from the company s properties 
occupancy of mall stores in the stabilized malls stabilized mall stores increased from at december   to at december  in the years ended december   and  average stabilized mall store sales per square foot were approximately  and  respectively computed using a monthly weighted average 
average stabilized mall store sales per square foot increased by for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  average base rent per square foot at the mall stores increased from at december  to at december  occupancy costs as a percentage of sales for tenants in the stabilized malls excluding acquisition malls from the year of acquisition were  and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the malls are generally located in middle markets 
management believes that the malls have strong competitive positions because they generally are the only  or the dominant enclosed malls within their respective trade areas 
trade areas have been identified by management based upon a number of sources of information  including the location of other malls  publicly available population information  customer surveys  surveys of customer automobile license plates  as well as zip codes and third party market studies 
the two largest revenue producing malls are hamilton place and burnsville center 
hamilton place is located on a acre site in chattanooga  tennessee and represented  as of december   of the properties total gla  of total mall store gla and of total revenues from the company s properties

anchors are a critical factor in a mall s success because the public s identification with a property typically focuses on its anchors 
mall anchors generally are department stores whose merchandise appeals to a broad range of shoppers 
although the malls derive a smaller percentage of their operating income from anchor stores than from mall stores  strong anchors play an important part in generating customer traffic and making the malls desirable locations for mall store tenants 
anchors either own their stores together with the land under them  sometimes with adjacent parking areas  or enter into long term leases with respect to their stores at rental rates that are significantly lower than the rents charged to tenants of mall stores 
anchors account for approximately of the total revenues from the company s properties

approximately square feet of ground in the vicinity of a former auto service center has been identified as being contaminated with total petroleum hydrocarbons and this is scheduled to be remediated during the demolition process 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority  and is not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of its present or former properties 
the company has not recorded in its financial statements any material liability in connection with environmental matters 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities for increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the cash provided from the operations of fifteen new centers opened and acquired in the last twenty four months 
cash flows used in investing activities for decreased by million  or  to million compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the smaller number of acquisitions in compared to the number of acquisitions in cash flows provided by financing activities for decreased by million  or  to million from million in this increase is primarily due to decreased borrowings related to the acquisition programs 
cbl associates properties  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate 
substantially all tenant leases do  however  contain provisions designed to protect the company from the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents from the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
year the year problem results from the use of a two digit year date instead of a four digit date in the programs that operate computers  information processing technology and systems and other devices ie non information processing systems such as elevators  utility monitoring systems and time clocks that use computer chips 
systems with a year problem have programs that were written to assume that the first two digits for any date used in the program would always be 
unless corrected  this assumption may have resulted in problems when the century date occurred 
on that date  these computer programs could have misinterpreted the date january  as january  this could cause systems to incorrectly process critical financial and operational information  generate erroneous information or fail altogether 
the year issue affects almost all companies and organizations 
the company s state of readiness for year the company had completed a program to identify both its information and non information processing applications that were not year compliant 
the company had corrected or replaced all non compliant systems and applications including embedded systems  by the end of the company initiated communications with its significant suppliers and tenants to determine the extent to which the company was vulnerable to the failure of such parties to correct their year compliance issues 
in addition  the company formed a year committee that includes senior personnel from most areas of the company 
costs to address the company s year issue as the company s year compliance issues have already been addressed  which costs were not material  and the company has not experienced any year problems with its operations  suppliers or vendors  the company does not expect to incur any significant additional costs regarding the compliance of all non compliant information processing systems and non information processing systems including embedded systems 
risks relating to the year issue and contingency plans although the company is not currently aware of any specific significant year issues involving third parties  the company believes that its most significant potential risk relating to the year issue is in regard to third parties such as tenants  vendors  banking services and utility providers 
with respect to tenants  a failure of their information systems could delay the payment of rents or even impair their ability to operate 
these tenant problems are likely to be isolated and would likely not impact the operations of any particular shopping center or the company as a whole 
the company will continue to evaluate these areas and develop additional contingency plans  as appropriate 
therefore  although the company believes that its year issues have been addressed  that suitable remediation and or contingency procedures are in place and that the new year is three months old and as of the filing date of this report the company has not experienced any effects of the year issue in its operations  vendors or tenants  there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo provides an additional indicator of the financial performance of the properties 
ffo is defined by the company as net income loss before property depreciation  other non cash items consisting of the write off of costs associated with development projects not being pursued  gains or losses on sales of real estate assets and gains or losses on investments in marketable securities 
the costs of interest rate caps and finance costs on the company s lines of credit are amortized and included in interest expense and  therefore  reduce ffo 
ffo also includes the company s share of ffo in unconsolidated properties and excludes minority interests share of ffo in consolidated properties 
the use of ffo as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of the properties  but also by the capital structure of the operating partnership and the company 
accordingly  management expects that ffo will be one of the significant factors considered by the board of directors in determining the amount of cash distributions the operating partnership will make to its partners including the company 
management also believes that ffo is a widely used measure of the operating performance of reits and provides a relevant basis for comparison among companies 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as  defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is not necessarily indicative of cash from operations available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
cbl associates properties  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in  ffo increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in the increase in ffo was primarily attributable to the continuing increase in revenues and income from operations from new developments and acquisitions and increases in occupancy levels and rent per square foot in the company s stabilized portfolio 
beginning with the first quarter of the company amended its calculation of ffo to include straight line rents in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
the company has restated prior years ffo to conform with the revised calculation 
the company will continue to exclude outparcel sales which would have added million  or per shares  in from its ffo calculation  even though the nareit definition allows their inclusion 
beginning on january  nareit has amended the definition of ffo to limit extraordinary items of income included in ffo to extraordinary items as defined by gaap 
cbl associates properties  inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s calculation of ffo is as follows in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  income from operations     add depreciation and amortization from consolidated properties     income from operations of unconsolidated affiliates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has managed the market risk for its variable rate debt with derivative financial instruments 
the derivative instruments are described in the liquidity and capital resources section in item above and in note to the financial statements 
the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflects the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
