in march  the company decided to close a branch in georgia 
in june  the company announced a settlement in principle with the office of the attorney general for the state of new york nyoag  which was to provide for retrospective relief to certain borrowers in the form of reduced monthly obligations aggregating million and prospective changes to some of the company s lending practices 
the nyoag took issue with delta s lending practices  specifically which loans should and should not be made by delta 
the settlement in principle was later expanded to include the new york state banking department nysbd and the us department of justice doj  which had raised similar concerns relating to delta s lending practices 
in september  the company finalized its settlements with the nysbd and the nyoag  but only after the nyoag filed suit against the company in august  as evidenced by a remediation agreement by and between the company and the nysbd  and a stipulated order on consent by and among the company and the nyoag 
as part of the final global settlement in lieu of the previously announced million settlement with the nyoag  the company agreed to  among other things  implement agreed upon changes to its lending practices  provide reduced loan payments aggregating million to certain borrowers identified by the nysbd  and create a reversionary fund the fund  administered by a trustee named by the nysbd  financed by the grant by delta of  shares of delta s common stock  valued at an assumed constant price of per share  which approximates the book value of the shares 
all proceeds raised through the fund shall be used for restitution and or to pay for a variety of educational and counseling programs at the discretion of the nysbd 
the twelve month period ended december  includes a million pre tax charge for the global settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag 
the company recorded a million pre tax charge in the second quarter of when it reached a settlement in principle with the nyoag 
subsequently  an additional million pre tax charge was recorded in the third quarter of when the company reached a global settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag 
the company finalized its agreement with the doj subsequent to december  the doj settlement  which parallels the nysbd and nyoag settlement agreements  was also signed by the federal trade commission and the us department of housing and urban development 
see legal proceedings for a more detailed discussion of the settlement 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of its business and financing strategy  delta sells the majority of its loans through securitization to a securitization trust and derives a substantial portion of its income from these sales 
in a securitization  the company sells a pool of loans it has originated or purchased to a remic trust for a cash purchase price 
the trust  in turn  finances the purchase of the pool of loans it has acquired by selling pass through certificates  or bonds  which represent undivided ownership interests in the trust 
holders of the pass through certificates are entitled to receive monthly distributions of all principal received on the underlying mortgages and a specified amount of interest  determined at the time of the offering 
when the company sells a pool of loans to a securitization trust  it receives the following economic interests in the trust a the difference between the interest payments due on the loans sold to the trust and the interest rate paid to the pass through certificateholders  less the company s contractual servicing fee and other costs and expenses of administering the trust  represented by interest only and residual certificates  and b the right to service the loans on behalf of the trust and earn a servicing fee  as well as other ancillary servicing related fees directly from the borrowers on the underlying loans 
the company s net investment in the pool of loans sold at the date of the securitization represents the amount originally paid to originate or acquire the loan adjusted for i any direct loan origination costs incurred an increase and loan origination fees received a decrease in connection with the loans  which are treated as a component of the initial investment in a loan under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  and ii the principal payments received  and the amortization of the net loan fees or costs  during the period the company held the loans prior to their securitization 
the company s investment in the loans also reflects adjustments for any gains a decrease in the investment or losses an increase in the investment the company has incurred on treasury rate lock contracts which the company has typically used to hedge against the effects of changes in interest rates during the period it holds the loans prior to their securitization 
see hedging 
upon the securitization of a pool of loans  the company i recognizes in income  as origination fees  the unamortized origination fees included in the investment in the loans sold  and ii recognizes a gain on sale of loans equal to the difference between cash received from the trust and the investment in the loans remaining after the allocation of portions of that investment to record interest only and residual certificates and mortgage servicing rights received in the securitization 
the majority of the net gain on sale of mortgage loans results from the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates retained by the company in a securitization for each period and the market value of the interest only certificates sold in connection with each securitization 
the company sold the interest only certificates created in each of the securitizations for cash proceeds and intends to continue to sell the interest only certificate as long as the sale effectively maximizes cash flow and profitability 
the interest only and residual certificates received by the company upon the securitization of a pool of loans are accounted for as trading securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount initially allocated to the interest only and residual certificates at the date of a securitization reflects the fair value of those interests 
the amount recorded for the certificates is reduced for distributions thereon which the company receives from the trust  and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of interest only and residual certificates  which are reflected in the statement of operations 
the company assesses the fair value of interest only and residual certificates based upon updated estimates of prepayment and default rates relating to loan groups comprised of loans of similar types  terms  credit quality  interest rates  geographic location and value of loan collateral  which represent the predominant risk characteristics that would affect prepayments and default rates 
the company values the mortgage servicing rights it retains in a securitization under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the amount of the investment in the loans allocated to the retained servicing rights is measured at the allocated carrying amount of such servicing rights  based on the fair value of the servicing rights 
the fair value of the servicing rights is determined by discounting to a present value using a discount rate which management believes reflects the discount rate market participants would utilize in purchasing similar loan servicing rights the estimated future contractual and ancillary servicing fees the company will receive and the estimated costs of servicing the loans 
those estimates are based on the stated terms of the transferred loans adjusted for estimates of future prepayment rates made on the basis of interest rate conditions and the availability of alternative financing  and estimates of future defaults among those loans  each of which would terminate the servicing of the loan and thus negatively affect servicing income 
the carry value of the servicing rights  which is classified on the balance sheet as capitalized mortgage servicing rights  is then amortized over the period of the estimated net future cash flows from the servicing income 
sfas no 
also requires that the capitalized mortgage servicing rights be assessed periodically to determine if there has been any impairment of the value of the asset  based on the date of the assessment 
the company performs this assessment based on the same prepayment and default estimates used to value interest only and residual certificates 
a valuation allowance is provided for the capitalized servicing rights relating to any pool of loans for which the recorded investment exceeds the fair value of the servicing rights 
in recording and accounting for mortgage servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  the company makes estimates of rates of prepayments and defaults  and the value of collateral  which it believes reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions 
the actual rate of prepayments  defaults and the value of collateral generally will differ from the estimates used due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions and the implicit imprecision of estimates  and such differences can be material 
prepayment and default rates  which are higher than those estimated  would adversely affect the value of both the mortgage servicing rights actual mortgage servicing income will be less  and significant changes could require an impairment of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights and the interest only and residual certificates  for which changes in fair value are recorded in operations 
conversely  prepayment and default rates  which are lower than those estimated  would increase the servicing income earned over the life of the loans and positively impact the value of the interest only and residual certificates 
there are currently two methods used to calculate the present value of the residual interests  the cash in and cash out methods 
the cash in method assumes value as the residual cash flow is received by the securitization trust even if it is used to create an overcollateralization provision 
in contrast  the cash out method assumes value at the time the residual cash flow is actually received by the residual certificate holder delta from the securitization trust  which is only after the required overcollateralization provision has been met 
as the company receives residual cash flows from the securitization trust  generally to months following the primary issuance  these two methods will create dramatically different values 
the company uses the more conservative cash out method  which calculates value at the time the residual cash flow is actually received by delta 
the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission have issued proposals relating to sfas no 
that would require companies to use the cash out more conservative  not the cash in more aggressive  method in accounting for the value of the retained interest residual in securitizations and overcollateralization assets 
this would result in one time residual asset write downs for companies that currently use the cash in method 
the company always has used the more conservative cash out method for accounting and will not be susceptible to a write down as a result of this proposed accounting change 
fair value adjustments in accordance with sfas no 
 upon the sale or securitization of a loan  a gain on sale and a corresponding asset is recognized for any interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying amount of the interest only and residual certificates is classified as a trading security and  as such  they are recorded at their fair value 
the company implemented sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise in the first quarter of the implementation of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
for capitalized mortgage servicing rights  a valuation allowance is recorded if the fair value of such rights is less than the carrying amount 
the fair values of both interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights are significantly affected by  among other factors  prepayments of loans and estimates of future prepayment rates 
the company continually reviews its prepayment assumptions in light of company and industry experience and makes adjustments to those assumptions when such experience indicates 
the company s review of its prepayment experience and assumptions at june  indicated that the prepayment rates during  particularly for adjustable rate mortgages arms  and in particular during the second quarter of  were higher than those historically experienced  or previously projected  by the company 
the company believes that these increases in prepayment rates were attributable to the continuation  for a longer period than historically experienced  of low interest rates  together with changes  to a flatter or inverted curve  of the relationship between long term and short term interest rates the yield curve 
as a result  at june   the company adjusted its prepayment assumptions  increasing the maximum prepayment rates for all loans  and changing the rate at which prepayments are assumed to increase from the initial rate to the maximum rate from a ramp to a vector curve 
these revised prepayment assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights retained by the company in securitizations completed prior to the second quarter of these revised prepayment assumptions were also used in valuing and recording the interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights retained by the company in its securitizations completed subsequent to the first quarter of during the second quarter of  the company recorded a million reduction in the carrying amount of its interest only and residual certificates  and also recorded a million reduction in the carrying amount of its capitalized mortgage servicing rights to reflect a provision for impairment the fair value adjustments 
both impairment provisions resulted from reductions in the company s estimates of the fair value of those assets 
the reductions in the estimated fair value resulted from the change in the prepayment assumptions used by the company to estimate the future cash flows to be derived from the interest only and residual certificates and the mortgage servicing rights 
the company makes assumptions concerning prepayment rates and defaults based upon the seasoning of its existing securitization loan portfolio 
the following table compares the prepayment assumptions used subsequent to the third quarter of the new assumptions  with those used subsequent to the first quarter of the q assumptions and those used at december  and through the first quarter of the old assumptions loan type month speed peak speed new q old new q old fixed rate loans six mo 
libor arms hybrid arms since the second quarter of  the company has utilized a vector curve  instead of a ramp curve  which the company believes will be more representative of future loan prepayment experience 
in  the company continued  as part of its ongoing practice  to review and assess its prepayment rate and loan loss reserve assumptions using a variety of factors 
such factors included a review of its own loan portfolio performance data  as well as management s current views on both the economic and competitive environments 
based upon this review  the company revised both its prepayment rate and loan loss reserve assumptions in to better reflect its anticipated future loan performance 
in the first quarter of  the company increased its loss reserve initially established for both fixed and adjustable rate loans sold to the securitizations trusts from to approximately of the issuance amount securitized 
in the fourth quarter of  the company lowered its prepayment speed assumption along parts of the prepayment rate vector curve while leaving the peak speeds intact 
in addition  the company increased its loss reserve initially established for both fixed and adjustable rate loans sold to the securitizations trusts from to approximately of the issuance amount securitized 
the prepayment rate assumption was revised primarily to reflect the company s actual loan performance experience over the past several quarters 
management believes that industry consolidation and a higher interest rate environment has and will continue to deter borrowers from refinancing their mortgage loans 
the loan loss reserve assumption was revised to reflect management s belief that slower prepayment speeds  coupled with an anticipated flat to slightly moderate rise in home values as compared to the past few years and borrowers who had avoided default through refinancing may be readily unable to do so because of industry consolidation and a higher interest rate environment  may have an adverse effect on the company s non performing loans 
these changes resulted in approximately a million reduction in the company s value of the residual and interest only certificates for the year an annual discount rate of was utilized in determining the present value of cash flows from residual certificates  using the cash out method  which are the predominant form of retained interests at both december  and december  the company uses the same prepayment assumptions in estimating the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general the company s net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  excluding a one time charge relating to the company s settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag  the company s net income for the year ended december  would have been million  or per share 
comments regarding the components of net income are detailed in the following paragraphs 
revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments the company made to its interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights in the second quarter of see fair value adjustments  an increase in servicing fees and origination fees  and was partially offset by a decrease in the net gain recognized on the sale of mortgage loans 
the company originated and purchased billion of mortgage loans for the twelve months ended december   representing a decrease from billion of mortgage loans originated and purchased for the comparable period in the company completed three securitizations and a loan sale through a conduit facility in totaling billion  compared to four securitizations and loan sales totaling billion in total loans serviced increased to billion at december  from billion at december  net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans represents the sum of a the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates retained by the company in a securitization for each period and the market value of the interest only certificates sold in connection with each securitization  b the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights associated with loans securitized in each period  and c premiums earned on the sale of whole loans on a servicing released basis  less the x premiums paid to originate or acquire mortgage loans  y costs associated with securitizations and z any hedge loss gain associated with a particular securitization 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of loans securitized or sold through a conduit facility to billion in  compared to billion of loans securitized or sold in  a revision to the company s loan loss reserve assumption in see fair value adjustments  coupled with wider spreads demanded by asset backed investors who purchase the pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts during compared to the decrease was partially offset by lower aggregate premiums paid to acquire loans  resulting from both a decrease in amount of loans purchased through the correspondent channel and lower average premiums paid to correspondents 
the weighted average net gain on sale ratio was in compared to in interest income 
interest income primarily represents the sum of the difference between the distributions the company receives on its interest only and residual certificates and the adjustments recorded to reflect changes in the fair value of the interest only and residual certificates  the gross interest earned on loans held for sale other than for loans sold into the conduit in which case  it is the net interest spread  with respect to loans sold into the conduit  the net interest margin earned excess servicing between the weighted average rate on the mortgage loans less the conduit s variable funding rate plus administrative fees  and interest earned on cash collection balances 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in interest income was primarily due to fair value adjustments made in to the company s interest only and residual certificates  including a million reduction in the second quarter of related to the change in prepayment assumptions see fair value adjustments 
the increase was also attributable to an increase in income recognized from the company s interest only and residual certificates primarily due to slower than anticipated actual prepayment rates 
see fair value adjustments 
this was offset partially by the accounting for loans sold by the company to a mortgage loan conduit prior to securitization in the third and fourth quarters of for conduit related sales  the company earns and records the net interest margin between the interest rate earned on the pool of mortgage loans sold to the mortgage loan conduit and the conduit financing rate  less administrative expenses 
typically  interest expense related to the company s other warehouse financing and borrowings are recorded directly to interest expense 
servicing fees 
servicing fees represent all contractual and ancillary servicing revenue received by the company less the offsetting amortization of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights  and any adjustments recorded to reflect valuation allowances for the impairment in mortgage servicing rights see certain accounting considerations  and prepaid interest shortfalls 
servicing fees increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the aggregate size of the company s servicing portfolio and the recording of a million impairment provision for the company s mortgage servicing rights during the second quarter of see fair value adjustments 
the average balance of the mortgage loans serviced by the company increased to billion for the twelve months ended december  from billion during the comparable period in origination fees 
origination fees represent fees earned on brokered and retail originated loans 
origination fees increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of a a increase in retail originated loans and b a increase in broker originated loans 
expenses total expenses increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily related to the company s settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag  and legal fees associated with the settlement  as well as personnel costs associated with the company s expanded retail  broker and servicing divisions  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense 
payroll and related costs 
payroll and related costs include salaries  benefits and payroll taxes for all employees 
payroll and related costs increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to staff increases related to growth in the company s servicing portfolio and commissions paid to employees related to an increase in loans originated through the company s broker and retail divisions 
as of december   the company employed  full and part time employees  compared to  full and part time employees as of december  interest expense 
interest expense includes the borrowing costs to finance loan originations and purchases under the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due issued in july the senior notes and the company s credit facilities 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the accounting for loans sold through a mortgage loan conduit prior to their securitization in the third and fourth quarters of  in which the company earns and records the net interest margin between the interest rate earned on the pool of mortgage loans sold to the mortgage loan conduit and the conduit financing rate  less administrative expenses 
typically  interest expense related to the company s other warehouse financing and borrowings are recorded directly to interest expense 
in addition  there was a decrease in the cost of funds on the company s credit facilities  which were tied to one month libor 
the one month libor index decreased to an average interest rate of in the twelve months ended december   compared to an average interest rate of for the comparable period in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of office rent  insurance  telephone  depreciation  goodwill amortization  license fees  legal and accounting fees  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and the provision for loan losses on the inventory of loans held for sale and recourse loans 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to the company s settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag  and the associated legal costs  and an increase in depreciation expense and management and consulting fees  reflecting the company s ongoing investment in technology

income taxes provided a effective tax rate for the year ended december   compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general the company s net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  comments regarding the components of net income are detailed in the following paragraphs 
revenues total revenues increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in origination fees and the net gains recognized on the sale of mortgage loans  reflecting the growth in the company s level of loan originations and purchases and securitizations 
in addition  servicing fees increased due to an increase in the aggregate size of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
these increases were significantly offset by a decline in interest income primarily due to the fair value adjustments made to the company s interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights in the second and fourth quarters of see fair value adjustments and a larger than normal hedge loss which was not offset by a higher gain on sale because asset backed investors who typically purchase the pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts demanded wider spreads see net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
the company originated and purchased billion of mortgage loans for the twelve months ended december   representing a increase from billion of mortgage loans originated and purchased for the comparable period in the company completed four securitizations and loan sales in totaling billion  compared to four securitizations totaling billion in total loans serviced increased to billion at december  from billion at december  net gain on sale of mortgage loans 
net gain on sale of mortgage loans increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to a increase in the amount of loans securitized or sold on a whole loan basis to billion in  compared to billion of loans securitized in  but was partially offset by a lower weighted average net gain on sale ratio 
the weighted average net gain on sale ratio was in compared to in net gain on the sale of loans increased less than the overall increase in loan securitizations primarily due to a the company s change to more conservative prepayment assumptions used in initially valuing the residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights acquired subsequent to the first quarter of see fair value adjustments  and b the impact of a hedging loss during the third quarter of resulting from lower interest rates that was not offset by a higher gain on sale due to substantially wider spreads demanded by asset backed investors who purchase the pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to the million and million fair value adjustments made during the second and fourth quarters of to the interest only and residual certificates previously discussed see fair value adjustments 
the effect of that adjustment was partially offset by increases in a interest only and residual certificates income  b interest on loans held for sale due to higher average balances  partially offset by a decline  from to  in the weighted average coupon rate on the mortgage loans  reflecting both a lower interest rate environment and the company s shift to higher credit quality loans and c interest on bank deposits resulting from a higher average balance held in securitization trust accounts by the company 
servicing fees

interest expense increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the company s issuance of senior notes in july and growth in loan production  which increased the level of debt needed throughout to finance the inventory of loans held for sale prior to their securitization 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended december   from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses associated with the company s increase in loan originations and purchases in  the expansion costs associated with the company s adding two additional fidelity mortgage retail branch offices  and depreciation expense reflecting the company s ongoing investment in technology 
income taxes 
the company recorded tax provisions of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes provided a effective tax rate for the year ended december   compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the company s expansion into lower tax rate states and local jurisdictions and to the benefits due to permanent book tax differences 
financial condition december  compared to december  cash and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio resulting in additional monies held in securitization trust accounts by the company  acting as servicer for its ongoing securitization program 
accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in reimbursable servicing advances made by the company  acting as servicer for its securitization program  related to a higher average servicing portfolio 
the company s average servicing portfolio increased to billion as of december  from billion as of december  loans held for sale increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the net difference between loan originations and loans securitized or sold during accrued interest receivable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to a larger average loan servicing portfolio  which resulted in increased reimbursable interest advances made by the company  acting as servicer for its securitization program 
capitalized mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was directly attributable to the company s capitalizing the allocated carrying value amount of the servicing assets  totaling million  resulting from the company s completion of three securitizations during  partially offset by the amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
interest only and residual certificates increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to the company s receipt of residual certificates valued and recorded at million from its securitizations during the year ended december   partially offset by normal amortization due to cash distributions and fair value adjustments 
equipment  net  increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures related to new technology and expansion

the aggregate principal balance of the senior notes  net of unamortized bond discount  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the senior notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually each february and august accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the accrual of the company s settlement with the nysbd and the nyoag  in addition to the timing of various other operating accruals and payables 
investor payable increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the company s portfolio of serviced loans to billion at december  from billion at december  investor payable is comprised of all principal collected on mortgage loans and accrued interest 
variability in this account is primarily due to the principal payments collected within a given collection period 
advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to a higher average loan servicing portfolio and the timing of payments collected and disbursed resulting in additional monies held in escrow trust accounts by the company acting as a servicer 
deferred tax liability decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to income tax payments of million 
stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this increase is primarily due to net income for of million and the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock at per share related to company s settlement with the nysbd and nyoag 
liquidity and capital resources following three successive quarters of generating positive cash flow from operations  the company had an operating cash deficit in the third and fourth quarters of the company anticipates it will continue to have an operating cash deficit for at least the next two quarters  due primarily to lower projected aggregate cash inflows from the company s retained interest only and residual certificates 
the lower projected inflows are due to expected timing differences between older deals cash flowing less per month per deal as the mortgage pool pays down and newer deals not yet cash flowing until initial reserve requirements are satisfied 
as initial reserve requirements on some newer deals are reached  the company expects to receive greater aggregate cash inflows from its retained interest only and residual certificates which  coupled with a the company s continued concentration on its less cash intensive broker and retail originations and b its recent history of utilizing favorable securitization structures that have allowed the company to sell senior interest only certificates for an up front cash purchase price  may offset the operating cash deficit in future quarters 
however  market conditions and various other possibilities identified below under risk factors could impact the company s cash flows potentially resulting in a more significant negative cash flow 
for the years ended december  and  the company had operating cash deficits of million and million  respectively 
the reduction in negative operating cash flow was primarily due to the company s de emphasis of the correspondent loan production channel  thereby decreasing the amount of premiums paid to correspondents and an increase in the cash flows from the company s retained interest only and residual certificates 
however  the company continues to use its operating cash to fund interest delinquency and servicing advance obligations required as servicer for its securitization program 
these interest and servicing advances are reimbursable to the company as the borrowers repay their obligations over time 
as such  the exact timing of these reimbursements cannot be predicted with certainty 
currently  the company s primary cash requirements include the funding of loan originations and purchases pending their pooling and sale  the points and expenses paid in connection with the acquisition of correspondent loans  interest expense on its senior notes and warehouse and other financings  fees  expenses  interest delinquency advances  servicing related advances and tax payments incurred in connection with its securitization program  and ongoing administrative and other operating expenses  including fees and expenses associated with the company s settlement of claims by the nysbd and the nyoag 
the company must be able to sell loans and obtain adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding in order to continue to originate and purchase loans 
historically  the company has utilized various financing facilities and an equity financing to offset negative operating cash flows and support the continued growth of its loan originations and purchases  securitizations and general operating expenses 
on july   the company completed an offering of the senior notes 
a portion of the senior notes proceeds were used to pay down various financing facilities with the remainder used to fund the company s growth in loan originations and purchases and its ongoing securitization program 
the company s primary sources of liquidity continue to be warehouse and other financing facilities  securitizations and  subject to market conditions  sales of whole loans and debt and equity securities 
to accumulate loans for securitization  the company borrows money on a short term basis through warehouse lines of credit 
the company has relied upon a few lenders to provide the primary credit facilities for its loan originations and purchases 
the company had six warehouse facilities as of december  for this purpose 
one warehouse facility is a million committed credit line with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of march this facility s maturity date was extended from february to march during the three months ended march  the company s second warehouse facility  a syndicated million committed revolving line with a variable rate of interest  was renewed in june and extended to mature in june the company s third warehouse facility is a renewal of a committed million mortgage loan conduit with a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of september the company s fourth warehouse facility is a million committed credit facility that has a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of april the company s fifth warehouse facility is a million committed credit facility that has a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of april during the third quarter of  the company obtained an additional warehouse facility with a million committed credit line that has a variable rate of interest and a maturity date of september as of december   the first warehouse facility had an outstanding balance of million and the second warehouse facility had an outstanding balance of million 
the company is required to comply with various operating and financial covenants as provided in the agreements described above which are customary for agreements of their type 
the continued availability of funds provided to the company under these agreements is subject to  among other conditions  the company s continued compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the company is in compliance with all such covenants under these agreements as of december  the company purchased a total of  shares of its common stock during the year ended december   under the company s stock repurchase program  at a total cost of million 
all of the repurchased shares were purchased in open market transactions at then prevailing market prices 
during  no additional shares were repurchased 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
profitability may be directly affected by the level of  and fluctuation in  interest rates  which affect the company s ability to earn a spread between interest received on its loans and the costs of its borrowings  which are tied to various united states treasury maturities  commercial paper rates and the london inter bank offered rate libor 
the profitability of the company is likely to be adversely affected during any period of unexpected or rapid changes in interest rates 
a substantial and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect the company s ability to purchase and originate loans 
a significant decline in interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments thereby decreasing the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio 
to the extent servicing rights and interest only and residual classes of certificates have been capitalized on the books of the company  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments or losses could require the company to write down the value of such servicing rights and interest only and residual certificates  adversely impacting earnings 
as previously discussed  the fair value adjustments that the company recorded in the second quarter of were primarily attributable to the company s change in prepayment assumptions to reflect higher than originally anticipated rates of prepayments see fair value adjustments 
in an effort to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk  the company has reviewed its various mortgage products and has identified and modified those that have proven historically more susceptible to prepayments 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications to its product line will effectively mitigate interest rate risk in the future 
fluctuating interest rates also may affect the net interest income earned by the company resulting from the difference between the yield to the company on loans held pending sales and the interest paid by the company for funds borrowed under the company s warehouse facilities  although the company undertakes to hedge its exposure to this risk by using treasury rate lock contracts 
see hedging 
hedging the company originates and purchases mortgage loans and then sells them primarily through securitizations 
at the time of securitization and delivery of the loans  the company recognizes gain on sale based on a number of factors including the difference  or spread  between the interest rate on the loans and the interest rate paid to asset backed investors who purchase pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts 
historically  the rate paid on the pass through certificates was generally related to the interest rate on treasury securities with maturities corresponding to the anticipated life of the loans 
if interest rates rise between the time the company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization  the excess spread narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans 
the company has implemented a strategy to protect against such losses and to reduce interest rate risk on loans originated and purchased that have not yet been securitized through the use of treasury rate lock contracts with various durations which are similar to selling a combination of united states treasury securities  which equate to a duration similar to the duration of the underlying loans 
the nature and quantity of hedging transactions are determined by the company based upon various factors including  without limitation  market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage originations and purchases 
the company will enter into treasury rate lock contracts through one of its warehouse lenders and or one of the investment bankers  which underwrite the company s securitizations 
these contracts are designated as hedges in the company s records and are closed out when the associated loans are sold through securitization 
if the value of the hedges decrease  offsetting an increase in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its hedge counterparty  will pay the hedge loss in cash and then realize the corresponding increase in the value of the loans as part of its net gain on sale of mortgage loans and its corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
conversely  if the value of the hedges increase  offsetting a decrease in the value of the loans  the company  upon settlement with its hedge counterparty  will receive the hedge gain in cash and realize the corresponding decrease in the value of the loans through a reduction in the value of the corresponding interest only and residual certificates 
up to and including the second quarter of  the company believed that its hedging strategy of using treasury rate lock contracts was the most effective way to manage its interest rate risk on loans held prior to securitization 
however  in the third quarter of  asset backed investors  responding to lower treasury yields and global financial market volatility  demanded substantially wider spreads over treasuries than historically experienced for newly issued asset backed securities 
as a result  delta s million hedge loss resulting from lower interest rates was not offset by a higher gain on sale as the company had historically seen 
given the company s belief that the volatile market experienced in the third quarter of would likely continue well into the fourth quarter and  as a result  that the spreads demanded by asset backed securitization investors would be difficult to predict  as asset backed securitization investors were more interested in absolute yields  instead of spreads over treasuries the company did not hedge any of its warehoused loans pending securitization in the fourth quarter of the company has continued to review its hedging strategy in order to best mitigate risk pending securitization 
as the asset backed securitization market improved in the first quarter of  and spreads over treasuries became largely more predictable  the company resumed its hedging strategy of selling treasury rate lock contracts to mitigate its interest rate risk pending securitization 
in  the company recorded a hedge gain of million  which largely offsets a decrease in the value of mortgage loans being hedged  as part of its gain on sale of loans 
inflation inflation affects the company most significantly in the area of loan originations and can have a substantial effect on interest rates 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation

impact of new accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
risk factors except for historical information contained herein  certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act pslra of  which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment  and are subject to change on various important factors 
the company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra by cautioning readers that numerous important factors discussed below  among others  in some cases have caused  and in the future could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the following include some  but not all  of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from projections o costs associated with litigation  compliance with the nysbd remediation agreement and nyoag stipulated order on consent  and rapid or unforeseen escalation of the cost of regulatory compliance  generally including but not limited to  adoption of new  or changes in state or federal lending laws and regulations and the application of such laws and regulations  licenses  environmental compliance  adoption of new  or changes in accounting policies and practices and the application of such polices and practices 
failure to comply with various federal  state and local regulations  accounting policies  environmental compliance  and compliance with the remediation agreement and stipulated order on consent can lead to loss of approved status  certain rights of rescission for mortgage loans  class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement action against the company 
o the company s ability or inability to continue to access lines of credit at favorable terms and conditions  including without limitation  warehouse and other credit facilities used to finance newly originated mortgage loans held for sale 
o the company s ability or inability to continue its practice of securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  as well as its ability to utilize optimal securitization structures at favorable terms to the company 
o a general economic slowdown 
periods of economic slowdown or recession may be accompanied by decreased demand for consumer credit and declining real estate values 
because of the company s focus on credit impaired borrowers  the actual rate of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on loans affected by the borrowers reduced ability to use home equity to support borrowings could be higher than those generally experienced in the mortgage lending industry 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  foreclosure  losses or increased costs could adversely affect the company s ability to securitize or sell loans in the secondary market 
o the effects of interest rate fluctuations and the company s ability or inability to hedge effectively against such fluctuations in interest rates  the effect of changes in monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  other activities of governments  agencies  and similar organizations  social and economic conditions  unforeseen inflationary pressures and monetary fluctuation 
o increased competition within the company s markets has taken on many forms  such as convenience in obtaining a loan  customer service  marketing and distribution channels  loan origination fees and interest rates 
the company is currently competing with large finance companies and conforming mortgage originators many of whom have greater financial  technological and marketing resources 
o unpredictable delays or difficulties in development of new product programs 
o the unanticipated expenses of assimilating newly acquired businesses into the company s structure  as well as the impact of unusual expenses from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  asset valuations  acquisitions  divestitures and organizational structures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates between the time when the company originates or purchases mortgage loans and the time when the company sells such mortgage loans at securitization can affect the value of the company s mortgage loans held for sale and  consequently  the company s net gain on sale revenue by affecting the excess spread between the interest rate on the mortgage loans and the interest rate paid to asset backed investors who purchase pass through certificates issued by the securitization trusts 
if interest rates rise between the time the company originates or purchases the loans and the time the loans are sold at securitization  the excess spread generally narrows  resulting in a loss in value of the loans and a lower net gain on sale reported by the company 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  which historically has resulted in approximately a basis point decrease in the excess spread  would be expected to reduce the company s net gain on sale by approximately basis points 
many factors  however  can affect the sensitivity analysis described above including  without limitation  the structure and credit enhancement used in a particular securitization  the company s prepayment  loss and discount rate assumptions  and the spread over treasuries demanded by asset backed investors who purchase the companies asset backed securities 
to reduce its financial exposure to changes in interest rates  the company generally hedges its mortgage loans held for sale by entering into treasury rate lock contracts see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hedging 
the company s hedging strategy has largely been an effective tool to manage the company s interest rate risk on loans prior to securitization  by providing the company with a cash gain or loss to largely offset the reduced increase excess spread and resultant lower or higher net gain on sale from an increase decrease in interest rates 
a hedge may not  however  perform its intended purpose of offsetting changes in net gain on sale 
this was the case in the third quarter of  when asset backed investors  responding to lower treasury yields and global financial market volatility  demanded substantially wider spreads over treasuries than historically experienced for newly issued asset backed securities 
as a result  delta s million hedge loss resulting from lower interest rates was not offset by a higher gain on sale as the company has historically seen 
changes in interest rates could also adversely affect the company s ability to purchase and originate loans and or could affect the level of loan prepayments thereby impacting the size of the company s loan servicing portfolio and the value of the company s interest only and residual certificates and capitalized mortgage servicing rights
