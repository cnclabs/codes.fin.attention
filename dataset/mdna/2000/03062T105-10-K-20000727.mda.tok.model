based on the collateral on hand at april   the company s subsidiaries could have collectively drawn an additional million on their revolving credit facilities

the amount available to be drawn under each of the company s revolving credit facilities is a function of the underlying collateral asset

the company is focusing on the development and expansion of its existing businesses and the potential acquisition or development of other unrelated businesses

million pertaining to an investment in a private venture capital fund which focuses on the investment in internet related or emerging technology companies 
the company plans to fund this commitment from cash on hand 
in march the company s board of directors approved a program  as amended  to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or in private transactions 
as of april  the company had repurchased  shares pursuant to this program 
the timing and amount of future share repurchases  if any  will depend on various factors including market conditions  available alternative investments and the company s financial position 
seasonality the company s automobile sales business is seasonal in nature 
in the automobile business  the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
none of the company s other businesses experience significant seasonal fluctuations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
increases in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on profitability 
financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables and fixed and variable rate notes payable 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables have scheduled maturities from one to months 
financial instruments also include mortgage notes held for sale 
the company does not experience significant market risk with such mortgage notes as they are generally sold within days of origination or purchase 
at april  the majority of the company s notes payable contained variable interest rates that fluctuate with market rates 
therefore  an increase in market interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income and profitability 
the table below illustrates the impact which hypothetical changes in market interest rates could have on the company s pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in market interest rates remain in effect for twelve months  ii the amount of variable rate notes payable outstanding during the period decreases in direct proportion to decreases in finance receivables as a result of scheduled payments and anticipated charge offs  and iii there is no change in prepayment rates as a result of the interest rate changes 
change in change in interest rates pretax earnings in thousands
