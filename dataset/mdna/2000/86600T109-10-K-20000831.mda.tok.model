the series b preferred stock converts at a floating rate based on the market price of the company s common stock  but the conversion price may not exceed per share  subject to adjustment 
as a result  the lower the price of the company s common stock at the time of conversion  the greater the number of shares the holder will receive 
to the extent the series b preferred stock is converted or dividends on the series b preferred stock are paid in shares of common stock rather than cash  a significant number of shares of common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of the company s common stock and encourage short sales 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of the company s common stock 
in that case  the company could be required to issue an increasingly greater number of shares of the company s common stock upon future conversions of the series b preferred stock  sales of which could further depress the price of the company s common stock 
the conversion of and the payment of dividends in shares of common stock in lieu of cash on the series b preferred stock may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of the company s common stock 
the company may be required to delist its shares from nasdaq if specific events occur 
in accordance with nasdaq rule  which generally requires stockholder approval for the issuance of securities representing or more of an issuer s outstanding listed securities  and under the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the company sold the series b preferred stock and related warrants  the company must solicit stockholder approval of the issuance of such preferred shares and warrants  including the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and exercise of the warrants  at a meeting of the company s stockholders  which shall occur on or before november  if the company obtains stockholder approval  there is no limit on the amount of shares that could be issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock 
if the company does not obtain stockholder approval and is not obligated to issue shares because of restrictions relating to nasdaq rule  the company may be required to pay a substantial penalty and may be required to voluntarily delist the company s shares of common stock from the nasdaq stock market 
in that event  trading in the company s shares could decrease substantially  and the price of the company s shares of common stock may decline 
substantial sales of the company s common stock could cause the company s stock price to fall 
if the company s stockholders sell substantial amounts of the company s common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and upon conversion of and issuance of common stock dividends on the series b preferred stock and exercise of the related warrants  the market price of the company s common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that the company deems appropriate 
the company may be required to pay substantial penalties to the holders of the series b preferred stock and related warrants if specific events occur 
in accordance with the terms of the documents relating to the issuance of the series b preferred stock and the related warrants  the company is required to pay substantial penalties to a holder of the series b preferred stock under specified circumstances  described above
