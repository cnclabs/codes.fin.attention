item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in recent years  we made the strategic decision to leverage msc s strength as a low cost  value added mro provider by adding new products and categories of mro supplies  such as welding and electrical supplies  which has increased  and is anticipated to further increase  sales to existing customers and access to new customers 
we believe that revenue has increased  in part  as a result of the increase in the number of skus 
we generally add skus in response to the feedback we receive from our existing customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the number of skus offered or that the correlation between the number of skus offered and revenue will continue 
we significantly expanded our direct mail marketing program from approximately million pieces in fiscal to million pieces in fiscal targeted mailings to customers or potential customers are designed to maximize our return in relation to our marketing expenditures 
we utilize our customer databases to match specific customer profiles with an expanding selection of catalog titles which emphasize specific product categories 
we believe that increasing mailings to more targeted customer segments has resulted in increased marketing productivity 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing our direct marketing efforts  however  the costs associated with our direct marketing program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of our direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers 
revenue per associate increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately during fiscal we believe that this increase in revenue per associate is indicative of our efforts to achieve higher levels of efficiency and cost savings at the associate level 
the number of annual orders entered and processed has increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million during fiscal the average order size for our core business has increased from approximately fiscal to approximately during fiscal we believe that our targeted marketing campaign strategy  our strategy of continuing to add new product categories and new products within existing categories  and increased efficiencies in order processing have been significant contributing factors to the increase in orders and sales we have received  both from existing customers and from new customers 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to continue to grow at rates recently experienced or at all

a diluted 







a basic earnings per share for fiscal in total exceeds by the sum of the applicable amount for each of the quarters of fiscal due to the impact of stock issuances on the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of commencement of operations at new distribution centers 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products  and facilities expansions 
our primary sources of financing have been cash from operations  supplemented by bank borrowings under our credit facility 
we anticipate cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be adequate to support our operations for the immediate future and for at least the next months 
under the terms of the credit facility  the maximum permitted borrowings are million million under an unsecured revolving credit agreement and million as a term loan 
interest on amounts borrowed may be paid at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate at august  or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate 
this credit facility contains certain covenants limiting mergers  use of proceeds  indebtedness  liens  investments  sales of assets  acquisitions  and issuance of dividends 
this credit facility also contains certain standard financial covenants 
as of august   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 
as of august   the company had approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
available borrowings at august  are million  all of which were available under the revolving credit agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million and net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
the change of approximately million in net cash provided from operations to net cash used in operations resulted from improved net working capital requirements  due to management s initiatives to reduce working capital  higher non cash items and higher net income 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the net usage of cash in fiscal was primarily attributable to expenditures for property  plant and equipment and cash paid for investments in internet initiatives 
the net usage of cash in fiscal was primarily attributable to cash paid for construction of the company s new headquarters  expenditures related to the construction of a new distribution center and cash paid for acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
the net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to proceeds received from notes payable  offset by the purchase in the open market of approximately  shares of class a common stock 
year management believes that the company mitigated its exposure relative to year issues for both information and non information technology systems 
the company s non compliant systems were either replaced or modified to become year compliant prior to december  the transition into the year resulted in no significant impact to the financial position or operations of the company 
to date  the company s suppliers continue to provide the company with sufficient goods and services in the year item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term notes payable under a credit agreement 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit agreement 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in the company s net income and cash flows 
the agreement allows the company maximum borrowings of million  of which million is a revolving credit agreement and the remaining million is a term loan 
at august   approximately million was outstanding under the credit agreement 
the agreement bears interest at the bank s base rate at august   or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate 
if the principal amounts under the company s credit agreement remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  then the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional million in interest that year 
the company does not make material use of derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
