inflation  risks and related factors affecting forward looking information this report and other published reports by the company contain forward looking statements regarding the status of proposed or pending sales and rental activity  future planned development  plus the long term growth goals of the company 
the forward looking statements made in this report are based  in part  on present trends the company is experiencing in residential  industrial and commercial markets 
the forward looking statements may also involve unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company s actual results and performance in future periods to be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by the forward looking statements in this report 
such forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements found herein to reflect any changes in company expectations or results or any change in events 
also  the company s success in obtaining entitlements  governmental and environmental regulations  timing of escrow closings  expansion of its income portfolio and marketplace acceptance of its business strategies are among the factors that could affect results 
the following risks and related factors  among others  should be taken into consideration in evaluating the future prospects for the company 
actual results may materially differ from those predicted 
sales of real estate the majority of the company s revenues is generated by its real estate operations 
the ability of the company to consummate sales of real estate is dependent on various factors including  but not limited to  availability of financing to the buyer  regulatory and legal issues and successful completion of the buyer s due diligence 
the fact that a real estate transaction has entered escrow does not necessarily mean that the transaction will ultimately item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued close 
therefore  the timing of sales may differ from that anticipated by the company 
the inability to close sales as anticipated could adversely impact the recognition of revenue in any specific period 
economic conditions real estate development is significantly impacted by general and local economic conditions which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s real estate operations are concentrated in southern california 
the regional economy is profoundly affected by the entertainment  technology  defense and certain other segments  which have been known to affect the region s demographics 
consequently  all sectors of real estate development for the company tend to be cyclical 
while the economy of southern california is currently robust  there can be no assurances that present trends will continue 
inflation the company believes it is well positioned against the effects of inflation 
historically  during periods of inflation  the company has been able to increase selling prices of properties to offset rising costs of land development and construction 
recently  land values have been increasing at a faster rate than costs 
however  there are no assurances that this trend will continue 
a portion of the commercial income portfolio is protected from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in the company s leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation  while the underlying value of commercial properties has tended to rise over the long term 
interest rates and financing fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing have an important impact on the company s performance 
sales of the company s properties could be adversely impacted by the inability of buyers to obtain adequate financing 
further  the company s real estate development activities are dependent on the availability of adequate sources of capital 
certain of the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and would be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates 
competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available which is comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
the company recently has experienced a slight decrease in its new home sale market share at both the local and the county level  due to the temporary decline in valencia new home inventory 
new competition is expected to deliver competing projects in the future that could impact the company s ability to reverse this trend 
geographic concentration the company s real estate development activities are focused on  acres in los angeles county 
the company s entire commercial income portfolio is located in the valencia area 
therefore  any factors affecting that concentrated area  such as changes in the housing market  economic changes and environmental factors  including seismic activity  which cannot be predicted with certainty  could affect future results 
government regulation and entitlement risks in developing its projects  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating such matters as permitted land uses  density and traffic  and the providing of utility services such as electricity  water and waste disposal 
in addition  the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
this government regulation affects the types of projects which can be pursued by the company and increases the cost of development and ownership 
the company devotes substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with these requirements 
to varying degrees  certain permits and approvals will be required to complete the developments currently being undertaken or planned by the company 
furthermore  the timing  cost and scope of planned projects may be subject to legal challenges  particularly large projects with regional impacts 
see following litigation discussion 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits for its projects can be beyond the company s control and could restrict or prevent development of otherwise desirable new properties 
the company s results of operations in any period will be affected by the amount of entitled properties the company has in inventory 
litigation the land use approval processes the company must follow to ultimately develop its projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of  and actual  third party challenges to planned real estate developments have provided additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation will  by its nature  adversely affect the length of time required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation increase the costs and may adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company utilizes both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million of variable debt with interest rates ranging from to and million of fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of the company s long term fixed rate and variable rate debt at december  by expected maturity dates fair dollars in thousands thereafter total value mortgage and other debt fixed rate debt         weighted average interest rate variable rate debt    weighted average interest rate the company has a million revolving mortgage facility which bears interest at libor plus or wells fargo bank s prime rate  at the election of the company  against which million was outstanding at december  the company also has a million unsecured revolving line of credit on which the rate is libor plus 
at december   million was outstanding against this line 
the amounts set forth in the table above assume that the outstanding amounts under the variable rate credit facilities will be repaid at the facilities respective maturity dates 
management believes that these lines will be renewed at maturity with similar terms 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt in order to maintain variable rate exposure at an acceptable level and by taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt 
in addition  the company s guideline for total debt is approximately of the appraised value of the income portfolio
