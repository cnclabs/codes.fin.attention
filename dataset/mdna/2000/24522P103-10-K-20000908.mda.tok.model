item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity of del monte during the three year period ended june  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of del monte for the three year period ended june  and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general del monte reports its financial results on a july to june fiscal year basis to coincide with its inventory production cycle  which is highly seasonal 
raw product is harvested and packed primarily in the months of june through october  during which time inventories rise to their highest levels 
at the same time  consumption of canned products declines  reflecting  in part  lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh alternatives and other factors 
this situation impacts operating results as sales volumes  revenues and profitability decline during this period 
results over the remainder of the fiscal year are affected by many factors including industry supply and del monte s share of that supply 
see seasonality 
in  in connection with del monte s recapitalization  del monte began implementing a new business strategy designed to improve sales and operating margins by increasing market share and distribution of high margin value added products  introducing new products and packaging  increasing penetration of high growth distribution channels  such as supercenters and warehouse clubs  achieving cost savings through operating efficiencies  plant consolidations and investments in new and upgraded equipment  and completing strategic acquisitions 
consistent with del monte s strategy to generate growth through acquisitions  del monte consummated the contadina acquisition in december the contadina acquisition contributes another established brand and positions del monte as the branded market leader in the high margin canned solid tomato category 
the contadina acquisition also establishes a strong presence for del monte in the branded paste based tomato products category  which includes tomato paste  tomato sauce and pizza sauce 
del monte believes that contadina s strong brand recognition  particularly in paste based tomato products  complements del monte s brand leadership in canned solid tomato products and enhances del monte s market share and household penetration 
del monte also reacquired the rights to the del monte brand in south america in august that acquisition has opened a new geographic market for del monte 
in addition to diversifying further del monte s revenue base  the contadina acquisition expanded del monte s processing scale  which has resulted in production cost efficiencies 
moreover  among the facilities acquired by del monte was a state of the art manufacturing facility at hanford  california 
in the third quarter of fiscal  del monte committed to a plan to consolidate processing operations over a three year period 
as part of these efforts  del monte transferred tomato production at its modesto  california facility to hanford following the summer pack 
del monte converted its modesto facility to a fruit processing facility that has assumed the production previously conducted at del monte s san jose  california facility and will assume the production currently conducted at the stockton  california facility 
del monte closed its san jose facility in december and will close its stockton facility after the production season in in connection with these actions  del monte recorded charges of million in the third quarter of fiscal  principally relating to severance 
del monte incurred additional charges as a result of these plant closures 
these charges included accelerated depreciation resulting from the effects of adjusting the tomato and fruit processing assets remaining useful lives to match the period of use prior to the closure of these plants 
accelerated depreciation totaling million and million was recorded in fiscal and  respectively  and million of such depreciation was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  del monte incurred costs to remove and dispose of those assets  as well as ongoing fixed costs during the modesto plant reconfiguration and until the sale of the san jose and stockton properties 
these costs totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal del monte s results over the next three year period are expected to be affected by related plant consolidation charges as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  in addition  del monte s vegetable processing plant located in arlington  wisconsin was closed in august total costs incurred in connection with this closure were million primarily relating to asset write offs 
del monte recorded this expense in the first quarter of fiscal the plant consolidation plan is a major component of a capital investment program of approximately million started by del monte a little over three years ago 
a total of million has been spent on this program as of june  del monte s goal for this program is to achieve cumulative cost savings by the end of the fifth year estimated at approximately million 
as of june   del monte estimates that approximately million in cumulative cost savings have been generated by this capital investment program 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from del monte s consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of del monte s net sales for such periods fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of products sold selling  administrative and general expense special charges related to plant consolidation acquisition expenses operating income interest expense the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  del monte s net sales by product categories  expressed in dollar amounts and as percentages of del monte s total net sales for such periods fiscal year ended june  in millions net sales canned vegetables a canned fruit a tomato products a subtotal domestic    south america b intercompany sales total net sales    as a percentage of net sales canned vegetables a canned fruit a tomato products a subtotal domestic south america intercompany sales total a includes sales of the entire product line across each channel of distribution  including sales to grocery chains  warehouse clubs  supercenters  mass merchandisers and other grocery retailers  as well as del monte s foodservice  food ingredients  export and vegetable private label businesses and military sales 
seasonality del monte s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
del monte s historical net sales have exhibited seasonality  with the second and third fiscal quarters having the highest net sales 
these two quarters reflect increased sales of del monte s products during the holiday period in the united states extending from late november through december  as well as sales associated with the easter holiday 
lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh produce and other factors have historically affected net sales in the first fiscal quarter 
quarterly gross profit primarily reflects fluctuations in sales volumes and is also affected by the overall product mix 
del monte s fruit operations have a greater percentage of annual sales and cost of products sold in the first fiscal quarter  as compared to its vegetable and tomato operations  due principally to increased sales of fruit cups during the back to school period 
del monte s vegetable and fruit operations have a greater percentage of annual sales and cost of products sold in the second and third fiscal quarters  principally due to the year end holiday season  and sales of ketchup and related cost of products sold typically increase in the fourth fiscal quarter 
selling  administrative and general expense tends to be greater in the first half of the fiscal year  reflecting promotional expenses relating to the back to school period and the year end holiday season  while easter is the only major holiday in the second half of the fiscal year 
the annual production volume of vegetable  fruit and tomatoes is driven by projected demand in the following year 
annual production is also influenced by general seasonal fluctuations primarily due to weather and overall growing conditions 
del monte ended fiscal with higher than desired inventory levels 
in order to reduce certain inventory levels  production volumes will be lower during the production season 
this lower pack will result in higher fixed costs per case 
these higher costs are expected to increase costs of products sold as expressed as a percentage of net sales  but are not expected to significantly impact overall profitability 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales 
consolidated net sales for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal approximately of consolidated net sales were generated by del monte s south american business in fiscal the decrease in sales in the current year primarily reflects the company s strategy to shift emphasis towards sales of higher margin products and to reduce emphasis on lower margin commodity items 
this resulted in a decrease in sales in the foodservice food ingredients channel 
excluding the foodservice food ingredients channel  net sales for the year increased approximately one percent over last year  primarily reflecting continued growth in the club and mass merchandisers channel and growth from new products fruit to go and continued expansion of orchard select offset by lower sales in the retail tomato business 
ketchup sales declined due to strong competitive activity  additionally  tomato sauce sales declined due to less aggressive merchandising 
although net sales were down as compared to prior year  the company s market share increased in all three major processed food categories 
in fiscal  del monte s market share for del monte branded vegetables  based on case volume  was versus in the previous year  while del monte s market share for del monte branded fruit products was compared to for the previous year 
del monte s market share for solid tomato products was in fiscal compared to in the fiscal cost of products sold 
costs decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  with cost of products sold expressed as a percentage of net sales of in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in costs in fiscal was primarily due to lower sales

other income expense 
other expense for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal due to the inclusion in of expenses related to the withdrawn july public equity offering 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the income tax benefit of million was primarily attributable to the release of the majority of the valuation allowance

in reaching this conclusion  significant weight was given to the company s current  as well as recent cumulative profitability 
net income before extraordinary item 
net income for fiscal increased by million compared to the same period of prior year 
the increase in net income is primarily due to the recognition of the valuation allowance  a more profitable mix of products sold and reduced plant consolidation costs

the transaction closed on august  for a cash purchase price of million 
in connection with this acquisition  del monte incurred approximately million of indirect acquisition expenses 
rjr nabisco had retained ownership of the del monte brand in south america and the del monte business in venezuela when it sold other del monte businesses in this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price was allocated as million to inventory  million to property  plant and equipment and million representing intangible assets 
net sales 
consolidated net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher volumes in the vegetable and fruit businesses  sales growth of over prior year in the club and mass merchandisers channel and contadina product sales which accounted for million of the increase in fiscal primarily due to a full year of contadina versus six months in fiscal 
approximately of consolidated net sales were generated by del monte s south american business 
the following discusses the increases within del monte s major product lines 
vegetable product sales increased due to the successful implementation of a new vegetable marketing strategy  which has resulted in merchandising efficiencies  the impact of improved packaging in club stores and a higher margin product mix 
fruit product sales increased in fiscal as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the introduction of new products fruitrageous and fruit pleasures single serve fruit products and the orchard select fruit in glass product  which began national distribution during the first quarter of fiscal fruit product sales also increased due to growth in the higher margin categories of fruit cups  specialty fruit and buffet fruit 
in fiscal  del monte s market share for del monte branded vegetables  based on case volume  was versus in the previous year  while del monte s market share for del monte branded fruit products was compared to for the previous year 
del monte s market share for solid tomato products was in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percent of net sales was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of net sales was primarily due to manufacturing cost decreases  higher product pricing and a favorable product mix 
manufacturing costs were favorable in the current year period as compared to the prior year period due to more favorable raw product costs  cost savings from capital spending initiatives and increased production levels 
selling  administrative and general expense 
selling  administrative and general expense increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in selling  administrative and general expense was primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with the introduction of new products  promotion cost increases resulting from higher volumes of product sold including the increase due to the acquisition of contadina and increased spending resulting from higher levels of promotional activity 
included in general and administrative expenses are research and development costs of million and million for fiscal and research and development spending in fiscal and remained focused on strategic spending to maintain the existing business and to develop product line extensions 
special charges related to plant consolidation 
del monte incurred special charges of million in fiscal compared to special charges of million million severance accrual and million accelerated depreciation in fiscal special charges for fiscal included million of accelerated depreciation related to buildings and machinery and equipment that will no longer be needed following the consolidation of the operations of two fruit processing plants and two tomato processing plants as compared to million in fiscal related to accelerated depreciation 
the plant consolidation plan was not implemented until the end of fiscal  therefore  only three months of accelerated depreciation was included in prior year s special charges as compared to twelve months of accelerated depreciation in the current year 
special charges for fiscal also included million of on going fixed costs and other period costs incurred at the modesto facility while under reconfiguration  as well as a million charge  recorded during the second quarter of fiscal  representing costs to be incurred for removal of tomato processing equipment to be disposed of 
in addition  special charges for also included million  representing primarily the write down to fair value of assets held for sale related to the closure of the arlington  wisconsin plant  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was relatively flat in fiscal debt balances increased significantly in mid fiscal due to the contadina acquisition 
however  after the february public equity offering  debt balances decreased in fiscal since the proceeds of the offering were used primarily to repay debt

it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value

the company is currently analyzing eitf  however based on management s current understanding and interpretation  eitf is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources del monte s primary cash requirements are to fund debt service  finance seasonal working capital needs and make capital expenditures 
internally generated funds and amounts available under its revolving credit facility the revolver are del monte s primary sources of liquidity 
management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolver will provide adequate funds for del monte s working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
del monte s ability to fund its cash requirements and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow 
these are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond del monte s control 
as part of its business strategy  del monte continuously reviews acquisition opportunities 
del monte believes that any acquisition would likely require the incurrence of additional debt  which could exceed amounts available under the bank financing as defined in financing activities activity 
as a result  completion of any such acquisition could require the consent of the lenders under the bank financing and the amendment and restatement of the terms thereof  including to permit del monte s compliance with its covenants 
del monte cannot predict whether  or the terms on which  the lenders under the bank financing would grant their consent 
operating activities the working capital position of del monte is seasonally affected by the growing cycle of the vegetables  fruit and tomatoes it processes 
substantially all inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  working capital requirements fluctuate significantly 
del monte uses funds from its revolver  which provides for a million line of credit  to finance the seasonal working capital needs of its operations 
in fiscal  cash used in operating activities was million primarily  due to an increase in inventories 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  primarily  due to a significant increase in sales 
investing activities in fiscal  cash used in investing decreased by million as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the purchase of the south american business in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in investing decreased by million as compared to fiscal due to the purchase of contadina in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were million  including million for the purchase of the cambria  wisconsin plant and approximately million for domestic environmental compliance  as del monte continued its implementation of a program which is intended to generate cost savings by introducing new equipment that would result in general production efficiencies 
of the remaining million of capital expenditures for fiscal  del monte spent approximately million in connection with its plans to consolidate processing operations and million for general manufacturing improvements 
del monte plans an aggregate of approximately million in capital expenditures for fiscal with approximately million of those expenditures to be incurred in connection with the company s continuing program to consolidate processing operations 
del monte continually evaluates its capital expenditure requirements  and such plans are subject to change depending on market conditions  del monte s cash position  the availability of alternate means of financing and other factors 
del monte expects to fund capital expenditures from internally generated cash flows and by borrowing from available financing sources 
financing activities activity credit agreement amendment and repayment of a portion of notes 
on january   the company amended its senior credit agreement with respect to its revolver and term loan facility term a loan and term b loan  collectively the term loan  and together with revolver  the bank financing 
the amendment provided for additional borrowing capacity up to million under either the revolver or term b loan 
the proceeds of this borrowing were used to reduce the revolver balance 
under this provision  the company increased its term b borrowings by million in august the amendment also adjusted certain financial covenants to reflect changes in the company s recent financial performance 
the amendment did not change the revolver s expiration date  the term loan maturity dates or the terms of the pricing schedule 
the amendment allowed the prepayment of up to million of senior subordinated notes 
during february  the company repurchased million of notes through the use of funds that carry a lower interest rate 
in conjunction with this early debt prepayment  an extraordinary loss of million million net of tax benefit of million was recorded  consisting of prepayment premiums and a write off of capitalized deferred debt issue costs and original issue discount 
financing activities activity public equity offering 
on february   the public equity offering  consisting of  shares of common stock sold by del monte and  shares of common stock sold by certain stockholders of del monte  was consummated at an initial offering price of per share 
del monte received net proceeds of million 
total common shares outstanding after the offering were  del monte used a portion of the net proceeds from the public equity offering to redeem million of its redeemable preferred stock  including million of unamortized discount  million of accreted dividends and million of redemption premium 
del monte also used million of the net proceeds to redeem a portion of its senior discount notes  including million of accrued interest and million of redemption premium 
del monte contributed the remainder of the net proceeds to dmc  its principal subsidiary 
dmc used the contribution to prepay million of its indebtedness under its bank term loans  to redeem million of its senior subordinated notes  including million of accelerated amortization of original issue discount  million of accrued interest and million of redemption premium  and to repay million of indebtedness under the revolver 
financing activities activity contadina acquisition 
in connection with the million contadina acquisition  del monte issued the senior discount notes the del monte notes with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million and received gross proceeds of million 
the del monte notes accrue interest at which accretes on each june and december through december   after which time interest is required to be paid in cash until maturity 
the del monte notes mature on december  a portion of the net proceeds from the february public equity offering was used to redeem of the del monte notes 
in connection with the contadina acquisition  del monte also amended the bank financing and certain related debt covenants to permit additional funding under the existing term b loan in an amount of million  thus increasing the aggregate amount outstanding at that time under the term loan to million 
restrictive covenants the dmc notes  the del monte notes  term loan and revolver agreements contain restrictive covenants which require del monte to meet certain financial tests  including minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time  subject to allowances for seasonal fluctuations 
del monte was in compliance with all debt covenants at june  the credit agreements applicable to dmc generally limit through restricted payment covenants the ability of dmc to make cash payments to del monte  thereby limiting del monte s ability to pay monetary dividends 
pension funding as described more fully in note of the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended june   del monte s defined benefit retirement plans were previously determined to be underfunded under federal erisa guidelines 
it had been del monte s policy to fund del monte s retirement plans in an amount consistent with the funding requirements of federal law and regulations and not to exceed an amount that would be deductible for federal income tax purposes 
in connection with del monte s recapitalization  del monte entered into an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation dated april  whereby del monte contributed million within days after the consummation of the recapitalization 
del monte contributed million in calendar and million in calendar del monte will contribute a minimum of million in calendar  of which million has been paid by june  del monte will also contribute a minimum of million in calendar  for a total of million 
the contributions required to be made in and have been secured by a million letter of credit 
this letter of credit is subject to periodic reduction as contributions are made in accordance with the agreement 
environmental matters del monte spent approximately million on domestic environmental expenditures from fiscal through fiscal  primarily related to ust remediation activities and upgrades to boilers and wastewater treatment systems 
del monte projects that it will spend an aggregate of approximately million in fiscal and on capital projects and other expenditures in connection with environmental compliance  primarily for boiler upgrades  compliance costs related to the consolidation of its fruit and tomato processing operations and continued ust remediation activities 
del monte believes that its liabilities under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  and other environmental liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on del monte s financial position or results of operations 
see business environmental compliance 
tax net operating loss carryforwards as of june   del monte had million in net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes  which will expire in applicable laws may limit del monte s use of these net operating loss carryforwards in any year 
inflation del monte s costs are affected by inflation and del monte may experience the effects of inflation in future periods 
however  del monte has historically mitigated the inflationary impact of increases in its costs by controlling its overall cost structure 
financial instruments and risk management policies del monte s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
del monte has entered into interest rate cap agreements limiting del monte s exposure to interest rate increases  thus limiting the impact of interest rate increases on future income 
del monte uses derivatives only for purposes of managing risk associated with the underlying exposures 
del monte does not trade or use instruments with the objective of earning financial gains on interest rate fluctuations alone  nor does it use instruments where there are not underlying exposures 
complex instruments involving leverage or multipliers are not used 
management believes that its use of these instruments to manage risk is in del monte s best interest and that any resulting market risk exposure would not materially effect del monte s operating results 
market risk exposure has been defined as the change in fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
del monte also has an insignificant degree of market risk exposure in regards to currency risk 
except for sales within south america by del monte s subsidiaries in columbia and venezuela  del monte requires payment in united states currency 
if non united states domiciled customers local currency devalues significantly against the united states dollar  the customers could potentially encounter difficulty in making the united states dollar denominated payments 
del monte does not believe it has any material commodity risk since del monte purchases most of its raw product requirements under arrangements whereby pricing has not fluctuated significantly in recent years 
see business supply and production and note to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  factors that may affect future results the future operating results of del monte may be materially affected by a number of factors  including  among others  those factors discussed below 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements  including those in the sections captioned business  selected financial data  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and financial statements and supplementary data 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about del monte s beliefs or expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on plans  estimates and projections at the time del monte makes the statements  and you should not place undue reliance on them 
del monte does not undertake to update any of these statements in light of new information or future events 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
del monte cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
these factors include  among others general economic and business conditions  weather conditions  crop yields  competition  raw material costs and availability  the loss of significant customers  market acceptance of new products  successful integration of acquired businesses  consolidation of processing plants  changes in business strategy or development plans  availability  terms and deployment of capital  changes in  or the failure or inability to comply with  governmental regulations  including  without limitation  environmental regulations  industry trends and capacity and other factors discussed below 
our high leverage could adversely affect our business 
del monte is highly leveraged 
del monte can incur additional indebtedness  even though its principal credit facility imposes some limits on the ability to do so 
because its business is seasonal  del monte s borrowings fluctuate significantly during the year  generally peaking in september and october 
del monte s high degree of leverage can have important adverse consequences  such as limiting del monte s ability to obtain additional financing  limiting del monte s ability to invest operating cash flow in its business  limiting del monte s ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged  increasing del monte s vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions  and increasing del monte s vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates 
del monte s ability to pay its debt service depends partly on its performance 
del monte s financial position could also prevent it from obtaining necessary financing at favorable rates  including at times when it must refinance maturing debt 
if del monte cannot pay its debt service and meet its other liquidity needs from operating cash flow  it could have substantial liquidity problems 
if del monte defaults on any of its debt  the relevant lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt and take other actions that could adversely affect del monte 
for example  in the event of a default under del monte s bank financing  the lenders could foreclose on the security for the facility  which includes virtually all of the assets of del monte 
our business is highly competitive 
many companies compete in the domestic canned vegetable  fruit and tomato product categories 
however  only a few well established companies operate on both a national and a regional basis with one or several branded product lines 
del monte faces strong competition from these and other companies in all its product lines 
important competitive considerations include the following some of del monte s competitors have greater financial resources and operating flexibility  several of del monte s product lines are sensitive to competition from regional brands  and many of del monte s product lines compete with imports  private label products and fresh alternatives  del monte cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of its competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on del monte 
also  when del monte raises its prices  del monte may lose market share to its competitors  and the canned food industry has in the past experienced processing over capacity  which could create an imbalance in supply and demand that depresses sales volumes or prices 
tri valley growers  a significant competitor in the canned fruit business  filed for bankruptcy on july  if tri valley  chooses to drop prices or increase discounts materially in order to generate cash due to its financial situation  that could negatively impact del monte s fruit and tomato businesses 
our business strategy poses special risks associated with our ability to reduce costs  reach targeted customers and complete acquisitions successfully 
the success of del monte s business strategy depends in part on its ability to reduce costs 
del monte s performance also depends on its ability to increase sales of its higher margin products and to increase product distribution through high volume warehouse clubs 
del monte also plans to increase operating results through acquisitions 
all of these plans involve risks  including the following del monte is converting its modesto facility from tomato to fruit processing 
following its seasonal pack of fruit  del monte will shut down the stockton facility for consolidation into modesto 
to assure production capacity for the fruit harvest  del monte must complete the conversion of the modesto facility by june if del monte does not meet this timetable to any significant degree  fruit production could be materially reduced  del monte may not complete capital projects on time or within budget  cost saving measures can sometimes impair a company s ability to respond rapidly to changes in the industry  warehouse clubs and mass merchandisers do not enter into long term contracts and purchase products based on their inventory levels 
they can stop purchasing del monte s products at any time  acquisitions could require the consent of del monte s main bank lenders  del monte may not be able to integrate successfully acquired businesses  including personnel  operating facilities and information systems  into its existing operations  and in pursuing acquisitions  del monte could incur substantial additional debt and contingent liabilities 
severe weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop supplies and reduce our operating results 
severe weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  earthquakes or pestilence  may affect the supply of del monte s products 
these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  lower recoveries of usable raw materials  higher costs of cold storage if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable or interruptions in del monte s production schedules if harvests are delayed 
our operating results are highly seasonal 
del monte does not manufacture the majority of its products continuously  but instead has a production period that is limited to approximately three to four months during the summer each year 
del monte s working capital requirements are also seasonal and are most significant in the first and second fiscal quarters 
del monte s sales tend to peak in the second and third fiscal quarters each year  mainly as a result of the holiday period in november and december and the easter holiday 
by contrast  in the first fiscal quarter of each year  sales generally decline  mainly due to less promotional activity and the availability of fresh produce 
our business is subject to the risk of environmental liability 
as a result of its agricultural  food processing and canning activities  del monte is subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
del monte has been named as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain designated superfund sites under cercla or under similar state laws 
del monte may in the future be named as a prp at other currently or previously owned or operated sites  and additional remediation requirements could be imposed 
also  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the food quality protection act of  the us environmental protection agency is involved in a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry 
the effect of such actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could have a material adverse impact on del monte s financial position or results of operations 
tpg continues to control del monte 
tpg partners  lp and some of its affiliates collectively  tpg own of the common stock 
tpg s large interest may also discourage  delay  deter or prevent a change in control of del monte or discourage bids for the common stock at a premium price 
del monte also has contractual relationships with tpg  under which tpg provides it with financial advisory and other services
