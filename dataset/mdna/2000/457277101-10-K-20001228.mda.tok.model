item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described in the section titled factors affecting operating results set forth below 
overview we were formed in february to develop and market scalable software applications designed to significantly enhance the performance and intelligence of large scale networks 
our applications fall into two broad categories network products and portal services 
network products revenues are composed of license  consulting  support and upgrade fees in connection with traffic server  content delivery suite and media ixt streaming media cache 
license fees are generally based on the number of cpus running the software and are generally recognized upon shipment of the software 
consulting  support and upgrade fees are recognized ratably over the service period as the services are performed 
portal services revenues are composed of revenues generated through our search solutions and commerce engine 
we generate revenues from our search solutions through a variety of contractual arrangements  which include general service fees  per query search fees and search service hosting fees  and search software licensing fees  all of which are recognized in the period earned 
our contracts for our commerce engine currently provide for payments to us consisting of annual infrastructure service fees  transaction fees from participating online merchants and per query search fees  and advertising revenues and general service fees from internet portals and other web site customers 
to date  revenues from online commerce have consisted primarily of annual infrastructure service fees and non recurring engineering fees 
total revenues from online commerce are expected to be modest for the next few quarters 
the network products segment generated operating income of million in the year ended september   an increase in operating income of million over fiscal the portal services segment generated an operating loss of million in the year ended september   an increase in operating loss of million or over fiscal the network products and portal services results exclude acquisition related costs  amortization of deferred stock compensation  purchased in process research and development and amortization of intangibles and other assets 
for additional segment information  refer to note  segment information  included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as presented later in this form k 
we have undertaken a broad initiative in the global wireless internet space 
this initiative encompasses our portal services and network products and is directed at providing the infrastructure software necessary for wireless network operators  internet portals and global enterprises to deliver the next generation of mobile data services 
to facilitate our entry into the wireless space  we will need to substantially modify our products and services  establish and maintain strategic alliances with a variety of companies  and hire new management  technical  sales and other personnel 
we expect to incur material expenses across all wireless expense categories and expect that revenues from this initiative will be modest for the next few quarters 
in october  we acquired webspective software  inc  a developer of software solutions for content and application distribution  delivery and management  to supplement our network products offerings 
the acquisition of webspective was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all financial information included herein has been restated to reflect the combined operations of inktomi and webspective 
the consideration paid for all equity interests of webspective consisted of  shares of our common stock 
we recorded acquisition related costs of approximately million in fiscal  primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other expenses 
webspective revenues from inception through september  were million 
webspective raised million through various stock issuances since its inception in march  and had net losses f rom inception to september  of million 
in july  we acquired of all outstanding stock and assumed all stock options of ultraseek corporation  a subsidiary of go 
com  the internet business of the walt disney company  in exchange for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
ultraseek operates under the inktomi name  and all employees of ultraseek joined us in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the acquisition  we recorded purchased in process research and development charges of million and amortization of intangibles and other assets charges of million in fiscal we accounted for the transaction under the purchase method of accounting 
this acquisition supports our initiative in the enterprise market enabling us to provide customizable search and navigation software for corporate intranet and extranet sites 
if inktomi and ultraseek were a combined company as of oc tober   the following would have been our pro forma combined financial results unaudited  in thousands for the year ended september  for the six months ended march  revenues   net loss   in october  subsequent to the dates of the financial statements contained herein  we consummated the acquisition of fastforward networks  inc  a developer of software solutions for efficiently enabling streaming media over networks 
the transaction will be accounted for under the pooling method of accounting 
the consideration paid for all equity interests in fastforward consisted of approximately million shares of inktomi common stock 
we expect to record acquisition related costs of approximately million in the quarter ended december   primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other expenses 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses across all lines of business  and in particular  to focus on the enterprise market and to support our new wireless initiative 
as a result  we will need to significantly increase revenues over historical levels to sustain profitability in the future 
although our revenues have grown in recent quarters  we cannot be sure that this growth will continue at the same rate 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
for the year ended september  revenues network products portal services total revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition related costs purchased in process research and development amortization of intangibles and other assets total operating expenses operating loss other income  net pretax loss income tax provision net loss fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over revenues of million in fiscal no single customer represented over of total revenues in either fiscal or we market and sell our products to customers located in the united states and abroad  both through our direct sales force and through our channel partners 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside of the united states has varied substantially  reflecting the early stage build out of our international operations 
we expect this variation to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have generated most of our revenues through direct sales efforts  except in asia where our revenues have been principally generated through our channel partners 
we will need to expand our existing channel relationships and establish new channel relationships worldwide to broaden our sales reach and revenue opportunities 
network products revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over network products revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased licenses of the traffic server network cache platform and content delivery suite software solution  particularly to network service provider customers in the content delivery  access and backbone markets 
these revenues consisted primarily of a small number of multi million dollar contracts per quarter and several other smaller contracts generally ranging between million and million 
up front license revenue generated from direct end user customers accounted for most of total network products revenues 
for fiscal  no customers represented over of all network products revenue  and for fiscal  two customers represented and of all n etwork products revenue 
portal services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over portal services revenues of million in fiscal most of the increase resulted from the addition and launch of new portal services customers  primarily smaller and mid tier portals 
of the total portal services revenues for fiscal  million was derived from the inktomi search engine and licensed enterprise search software and million was derived from the inktomi commerce engine 
for fiscal  one customer represented of all portal services revenue  and for fiscal  three customers represented  and of all portal services revenue 
during fiscal  we recognized revenues of approximately million on contracts  development  and licensing arrangements with customers in which we are equity shareholders 
prices on these contracts and arrangements were comparable to those given to other similarly situated customers 
expenses operating expenses include cost of revenues  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  acquisition related expenses  purchased in process research and development and amortization of intangibles and other assets 
most of our expenses other than cost of revenues  acquisition related expenses  purchased in process research and development and amortization of intangibles and other assets consist of personnel and related costs across the functional areas listed above 
a significant portion of our operations is located in silicon valley where competition for personnel and other resources is intense 
as we grow our businesses  we expect our total costs per employee to increase  which along with increased headcount will increase our expenses in absolute dollars 
we are subject to employer payroll taxes on gains on certain employee stock options 
at september   our stock price closed at per share 
had our employees exercised all of these options on september  at this price  we would have been subject to payroll taxes on gains realized by our employees of million on vested options and million on unvested options 
these amounts would be charged to operations in the period the options are exercised 
should a significant number of our employees choose to exercise options  or if our stock price increases significantly  our quarterly results of operations would be adversely affected 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of expenses related to the operation of our search and commerce services  primarily depreciation  network and hosting charges  as well as royalties for our media ixt application 
cost of revenues was million for fiscal  a decrease as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars were due primarily to additional depreciation  network and hosting charges resulting from expansions of our data centers in the united states and abroad during fiscal and we expect cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars in the next few quarters due primarily to increased royalties for our media ixt application and  to a lesser extent  expanded cluster operations costs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and marketing staff as well as expenses related to our marketing programs  including trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel  increased sales commissions and additional marketing programs  including the initiation of a branding campaign 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars over the next few quarters as we establish sales offices in additional domestic and international locations  hire additional sales and marketing personnel  incur increased sales commissions expenses  and expand our marketing programs  including our branding campaign 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development and technical support efforts 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over the comparable period in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel to support expansion of our search engine and network products businesses  online commerce development  and increases in quality assurance  technical support and technical publications personnel 
we believe significant investment in research and development is essential to our future success and expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and legal 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel  increased accounting and legal costs incurred in connection with business activities and purchases related to our corporate headquarters in foster city  california 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow as our business and employee base expands 
acquisition related costs in october  we acquired webspective software  inc  a developer of software solutions for content and application distribution  delivery and management  to supplement our network products offerings 
the acquisition of webspective was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition related costs of approximately million in the quarter ended december   primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other expenses 
in april  we acquired impulse buy network  a developer of online merchandising software  to supplement the functionality of our commerce engine 
we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition  primarily for accounting  legal and other expenses 
as of september   all acquisition related costs had been paid 
purchased in process research and development a portion of the purchase price we paid for ultraseek has been allocated to developed technology and in process research and development iprd 
we identified and valued the developed technology and iprd by conducting extensive interviews  analyzing data provided by ultraseek concerning developmental products  considering the stage of development of such products and the time and resources needed to complete them  and assessing the expected income generating ability of the products  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and iprd 
based on our analysis of these variables  we recorded a one time purchased iprd charge of million in fiscal amortization of intangibles and other assets as a result of our ultraseek acquisition in fiscal  we recorded goodwill of million under intangibles and other assets 
we began amortizing this balance in july  and will continue doing so on a straight line basis over a period of months 
the fiscal amortization of intangibles and other assets totaled million 
other income  net other income  net includes interest on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  less expenses related to our debt and capital lease obligations and losses recorded for the equity method of accounting for our minority investment in airflash  inc other income  net  totaled million of income in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal most of this increase was generated from million from gains on sales of investments in equity securities and million in interest income from our cash and cash equivalents 
these gains were partially offset by million in losses recorded in fiscal  representing our proportionate share of losses related to our minority investment in airflash 
the increase was also offset by the write off of obsolete computer and networking equipment  and interest charges 
we also recognized losses for the abandonment of leasehold improvements and equipment with a net book value of approximately million due to corporate relocation in fiscal fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over revenues of million in fiscal no single customer individually represented over of total revenues for fiscal in fiscal  four customers each represented over and  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
network products revenues totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over network products revenues of million in fiscal most of these revenues represented new traffic server network cache license fees 
portal services revenues totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or increase over portal services revenues of million in fiscal most of this increase came from the provision of search services to new customers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in revenues from existing search customers 
expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased depreciation and network charges resulting from expansions of our data centers in california and the establishment of a data center in the united kingdom during fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel in the united states and abroad  expenses incurred in connection with attendance at trade shows and additional marketing programs  and increased sales commissions 
research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel to support expansion of our search engine and network products businesses  online commerce development  and increases in quality assurance  technical support and technical publications personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel and increased legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with business activities 
acquisition related charges in april  we acquired impulse buy network  a developer of online merchandising software  to supplement the functionality of our commerce engine 
we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition  primarily for accounting  legal and other expenses 
in september  we acquired cb technologies  a developer of online commerce software 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we incurred expenses of million related to the transaction 
the charge included cb s financial advisory fees  facilities consolidation costs  and legal and accounting fees 
other income  net other income  net totaled million of income in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal most of this increase was generated from million of interest income on proceeds from our june initial public offering and prior preferred stock issuances  partially offset by increased interest charges on debt and capital lease obligations 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending september  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k

at september   we maintained million of our cash as restricted under the terms of our synthetic lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in foster city  california 
investments in equity securities totaled million at september   up from million at september  our investments that have readily determinable fair values are marked to market with any change from cost or prior value as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
other strategic investments in equity securities are carried at cost 
all of our investments in equity securities are comprised of strategic investments in internet companies 
internet stock values are volatile and therefore our investments in equity securities balance may fluctuate significantly in the future 
we expect to continue such investments during the upcoming fiscal year 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal this compares to million used in operations in the comparable period in fiscal the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to our net income in fiscal of million net of non cash charges and excluding amortization of deferred compensation  acquisition related charges  purchased in process research and development and amortization of intangibles and other assets  increased deferred revenues and accrued liabilities 
we have made significant investments in property and equipment since inception 
these investments consist largely of computer servers  workstations  networking equipment and leasehold improvements associated with our corporate headquarters in foster city  california 
we invested million and million  respectively  in fiscal and  primarily to expand our search engine service capacity  launch and support our online commerce business and for leasehold improvements 
approximately million of the property and equipment investments in fiscal were part of a sale leaseback transaction in which we sold furniture and related items to a leasing company and leased the furniture and related items under a new capitalized lease agreement 
in the past  we have used debt and leases to partially finance capital purchases 
we obtained an additional million and million in bank loans and added nil and million in capitalized leases  respectively  to partially fund increased search and online commerce capacity in fiscal and at september   we had million in total loans and capitalized lease obligations outstanding  collateralized by a certain portion of our accounts receivable and the underlying fixed assets acquired with each respective debt instrument 
approximately million of our debt at september  was in the form of bank loans 
the bank loans include certain covenants requiring minimum liquidity  tangible net worth and profitability over time 
in april  we entered into a lease commencing november  for approximately  square feet of office space in two mid rise office buildings in foster city  california 
aggregate payments to be made under the lease are approximately million over the lease term ending october  we also expect to undertake significant capital improvements on such property 
in august  we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for the land and facilities of our corporate headquarters  including all improvements related to this property for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the agreement was assigned to a third party lessor under the terms of a lease finance structure 
this structure also required the creation and maintenance of a cash collateral account that limits the liquidity of million of our cash 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing international operations  the extent and timing of investments  acquisition costs  and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to hire and expand our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and for other general corporate activities 
factors affecting operating results interested persons should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our business substantially depends upon the success of our traffic server product  content delivery suite and media products 
our future growth substantially depends on the commercial success of our traffic server network cache product  our content delivery suite software solution and our newly acquired media products 
we are targeting several market segments for these products  including telecommunications and backbone carriers  internet access networks  internet hosting providers  oem customers  large enterprise customers  wireless networks and content delivery networks 
our ability to generate substantial and sustained revenues from these products is dependent upon achieving sales penetration in each of these market segments and significantly increasing the number of new and repeat customer transactions  especially within the enterprise market 
in this regard  we will need to continue to modify and enhance our products for each of these market segments and establish effective marketing programs including promotion of the con tent bridge alliance to augment the sales process 
the markets for large scale network caching  content delivery and streaming media are in their early stages  and we are not sure our target customers will widely adopt and deploy these technologies throughout their networks 
even if they do so  they may not choose our products because they do not include the features they require  they wish to outsource content delivery and streaming media services to a third party vendor rather than directly implement enabling technology in their networks  or for technical  cost  support or other reasons 
demand for our streaming media products is dependent on increasing availability of media content on networks  the build out of broadband capabilities and the establishment of profitable business models by our customers  among other factors  all which are outside of our control 
the streaming media market is in its early stages and the amount of appealing streaming content currently available is relatively limited 
the amount of streaming content available over public networks and enterprise networks must increase substantially for our potential customers to justify their purchase of our media products 
our media products are complex which may stall their deployment 
growth in sales of our media products in the service provider space depends on the increased availability and usage of broadband access to the internet 
we cannot be sure that broadband access to the internet will grow fast enough or be utilized by enough persons to create a sustainable marketplace for our media products 
in addition  successful business models for the delivery of streaming media content must be developed in order for there to be sufficient demand for our media products in the service provider mark etplace 
our business would be harmed if customers choose not to use or promote our search services 
revenues from our search services result primarily from the number of end user searches processed by our search engine 
our agreements with customers do not require them to direct end users to our search services or to use our search services exclusively or at all 
accordingly  revenues from search services are highly dependent upon the willingness of customers to promote and use the search services we provide  the ability of our customers to attract end users to their online services  the volume of end user searches that are processed by our search engine  and the ability of customers to monetize traffic from their web site search pages 
some of our customers have selected competing search and directory services to operate in combination with our services  which has reduced the number of queries available for us to serve and may erode future revenue growth opportunities 
the technological barriers for cu stomers to implement additional services or to replace our services are not substantial 
the market for internet search is maturing and many smaller and medium size portals are not profitable  suffer from declining revenue growth and have limited access to capital to fund operational needs 
in order for us to continue to increase revenues from our search engine business at historical rates  we will need to continue to sign up an increasing number of new customers  develop and deliver new search services  products and features to existing and future customers  and establish deeper strategic relationships with our customers 
in addition  we will need to generate revenues from other interested parties in the search process such as content providers and broaden our market opportunities such as through our enterprise search software license business 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors in each of our market segments  many of which are bringing new solutions to market  establishing technology alliances and oem relationships with larger companies  and focusing on specific segments of our target markets 
in some cases  our competitors are implementing aggressive pricing and other strategies that are focused in the short term on building customer bases  name recognition in the market and capturing market share 
this may cause some price pressure on our products and services in the future 
we directly compete against several companies in the network cache  content delivery and streaming media markets  including akamai  cacheflow  cisco systems  infolibria  microsoft  netscape  network appliance  novell  realnetworks and spyglass 
we are aware of numerous other major software developers as well as smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our network products 
we also believe that we may face competition from other providers of competing solutions to network infrastructure problems  including networking hardware and software manufacturers  traditional hardware manufacturers  telecommunications providers  cable tv communications providers  software database companies  and large diversified software and technology companies 
many of these companies provide or have announced their intentions to provide a range of software and hardware products based on internet protocols and to compete in the broad internet intranet software market as well as in specific market segments in which we compete 
we compete with a number of companies to provide internet search and directory services and technology 
in the services marketplace  our primary competitors include a variety of established and newer companies  including altavista  ask jeeves  fast search and transfer  google  goto 
com  infoseek  looksmart  netscape open directory and northern light 
these companies and other competitors have focused on search result relevance  database size metrics and ease of use to differentiate their services 
in the software market  our primary competitors include altavista  autonomy  dataware  excalibur  fulcrum  lotus  microsoft and verity 
we also indirectly compete in this market with oracle and other database vendors that offer information search and retrieval capabilities with their core database products  and web platform companies such as netscape 
in addition  several large media and other internet based com panies have made investments in  or acquired  internet search engine companies and may seek to develop or customize their products and services to deliver to our target customers 
the market for our commerce engine application is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
our current and potential competitors include other providers of commerce technologies and services including frictionless commerce and infospace  commerce destination sites including deal time and mysimon  third party merchant aggregators including affinia  commerce wallet providers including brodia and gator  affiliate services including befree and linkshare  and internet portals and other captive marketplace web sites  including amazon 
com  america online  excite home and yahoo 
we believe the principal factors that will draw end users to an online commerce application include brand availability  selection  personalized services  convenience  price  accessibility  customer service  quality of search tools  quality of content  and reliability and speed of fulfillment for products ordered 
because we serve prim arily as a technology and infrastructure provider  our customers and partners determine many of these factors and we have little or no control over them 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
in addition  our current and potential competitors may bundle their products with other software or hardware  including operating systems and browsers  in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing products offered by us 
also  current and potential competitors have or may have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary content 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  fewer search queries served  fewer online commerce transactions and traffic  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the internet infrastructure market is rapidly changing and we must develop  acquire  and introduce new products and technologies to continue to grow our revenues at historical rates and remain competitive 
the internet infrastructure market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
our future success and revenue growth will depend upon our ability to develop  acquire and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers  particularly in the enterprise market 
the increasing scope of our business has led us to allocate additional resources to our current business opportunities and fewer resources to longer term projects 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
material delays in introducing new produ cts and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products or to purchase those of our competitors 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will come from licenses of the traffic server network cache platform  content delivery suite software solution and our newly acquired media products 
we further expect that these revenues will come from licenses to a relatively small number of customers 
the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict because the markets for traffic server platform  content delivery suite and our media products are in their early stages  the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and some customers in our target markets have limited access to capital to fund operational needs 
historically  customer orders during a quarter have consisted of a small number of multi million dollar deals and several other smaller orders ranging from million to million 
the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of traffic s erver  content delivery suite or media products would reduce our expected revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for later quarters may not compare favorably with operating results from earlier quarters 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
we plan to increase our operating expenses significantly to support our entry into the wireless market  expand our sales and marketing operations  broaden our customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels  and fund greater levels of research and development 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons already discussed or for any other reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock may fall 
our future revenue growth depends on our ability to expand our sales  distribution and support organizations 
we will need to substantially expand our direct and indirect sales operations  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase market awareness and sales of our products 
our products and services require sophisticated sales efforts targeted at several people within our prospective customers organizations 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting 
in addition  our future revenue growth is dependent upon establishing and maintaining productive relationships with a variety of distribution partners  including oems  resellers  systems integrators and joint marketing partners 
we seek to sign up distribution partners that have a substantial amount of technical expertise in the computer network and telecommunications industry 
even with this expertise  our distribution partners generally require a significant amount of training and support from us  and we anticipate that it will take several quarters before any of our distribution partners will develop the expertise and skills necessary to effectively sell our products 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in signing up the desired distribution partners or that our distribution partners will devote adequate resources or have the technical and other sales capabilities to sell our products 
similarly  the complexity of our products and the difficulty of installing them require highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we currently have a relatively small customer service and support organization and will need to increase our staff to support new customers  new product lines  the expanding needs of existing customers and the internationalization of our business 
competition for customer service and support personnel is intense in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the relevant industries including the internet  telecommunications and commerce 
the global wireless internet space is a new market and we cannot be certain that our entry into this market will be successful 
we have recently undertaken a broad initiative in the global wireless internet space 
the market for new wireless internet products and services is in an early stage of development and is rapidly evolving 
we have limited experience in the wireless market and cannot be certain that the market will develop in such a manner as to provide us with substantial revenue generating opportunities 
several companies are developing products and services targeted to the wireless space  many of which are ahead of us in development and implementation 
we expect competition to be intense 
to facilitate our entry into the wireless space  we will need to modify our products and services  establish and manage strategic alliances with a variety of companies including wireless operators  content providers  hardware manufacturers and integrated service vendors  and hire new management  technical sales and other personnel 
in this connection  we expect to incur material expenses across all expense categories for the next several quarters 
we cannot be certain that our entry into the wireless space will be successful 
the loss of a key customer could adversely affect our revenues and be perceived as a loss of momentum in our business 
we have generated a substantial portion of our historical revenues from a limited number of customers 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if we lose a major customer for any reason  including non renewal of a customer contract or our failure to meet performance requirements under our portal services agreements  or in the case of our search engine business if there is a decline in usage of any customer s search service  our revenues would be adversely affected 
our potential customers and public market analysts or investors may perceive any such loss as a loss of momentum in our business  which may adversely affect future opportunities to sell our products and services and cause our stock price to decline 
we cannot be sure that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to generate revenues in any future period 
the online commerce market is rapidly evolving and our success is dependent on many factors outside of our direct control 
the online commerce market is in a rapid state of evolution with a large number of companies pursuing a wide variety of business approaches to selling goods over the internet 
many of these companies are spending substantial funds to develop brand recognition and large bases of end user consumers 
in addition  a number of online retailers have recently announced bankruptcy or significant operational challenges 
our business model is based on supplying commerce platform services to internet portals and other web site customers  which in turn make these services available to their end users 
many of our customers are new to online commerce and have limited experience in promoting commerce transactions through their web sites 
the success of our commerce engine will largely depend on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include our ability to establish and maintain strong relationships with customers and online merchants  increasing end user traffic and transactions across our customers web sites  our ability to assemble a robust and varied database of products of interest to end user consumers  the ability and willingness of our customers to promote our commerce services on their web sites  market conditions affecting the purchase of infrastructure software solutions  the dollar volume of online purchases made by end users of our customers web sites  and the level of advertising and other revenues generated by customers 
we have made significant investments in our online commerce business 
these investments have been and will continue to be required in advance of generating significant revenues and profitability  which have consisted primarily of infrastructure service fees and non recurring engineering fees to date and are expected to be modest for the next few quarters 
we cannot be sure that our participation within the online commerce business will be successful 
our commerce engine is designed to collect and organize vast amounts of electronic information from online merchants and publishers of comparative product information 
the commerce engine is also designed to track and confirm purchases made by end users of our customers services and to generate invoices for our online merchants to support performance based marketing arrangements among multiple parties 
these are highly complex tasks 
our commerce engine customers demand a wide variety of complex features and deployment requirements 
these deployments require substantial resources and execution  and we cannot be certain that we will meet required schedules or successfully develop all required technologies 
the legal environment in which we operate is uncertain and claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
our products and services operate in part by making copies of material available on the internet and other networks and making this material available to end users from a central location or local systems 
in addition  our portal services technology systems collect end user and transaction information  which we use to deliver services to our customers and merchant partners 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with customers for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or under other legal theories based on the nature  content  copying  dissemination  collection or use of these materials 
these claims have been threatened against us from time to time and have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against online service providers 
it is also possibl e that if any information provided through any of our portal services or facilitated by our network products contains errors  third parties could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on this information 
further  there is the potential for product liability claims to be asserted against us by end users who purchase goods and services through our commerce engine 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
internet related laws could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations that apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the united states congress recently enacted internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union recently enacted its own privacy regulations  and is currently considering copyright legislation that may extend or clarify the existence of the right of reproduction held by copyright holders to control the right to make temporary copies for any reason  including caching and other copies made during the transmission process 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
the adoption  implementation or modification of laws and regulations relating to the internet  or interpretations of existing law  could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
our ability to offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market successfully requires an effective planning and management process 
we have substantially increased the scope of our operations in recent quarters  both domestically and internationally  and have grown our headcount considerably 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems  personnel and other resources 
we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  enhance our internal and external security systems  and continue to expand  train and manage our work force worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  merchants and other third parties  all in a rapidly changing environment 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these undertakings 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with customers and the companies that supply and distribute our products  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with key hardware and software vendors  internet technology and service providers  distribution partners and customers 
we believe these relationships are important in order to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products  enhance our product and service offering  and expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to develop these key relationships or maintain and enhance existing relationships  particularly in the area of streaming audio and video  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we have from time to time licensed components from others such as reporting functions and security features and incorporated them into our products and services 
if these licensed components are not maintained  it could impair the functionality of our products and services and require us to obtain alternative products from other sources or to develop this software internally 
in either case  this could involve costs and delays as well as diversion of engineering resources 
any acquisitions that we make could adversely affect our operations or financial results 
we have purchased five companies since september and intend to continue to invest in or acquire complementary companies  products and technologies in the future 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations and maintaining acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
also  we could have difficulty in integrating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
there could be potential unknown liabilities associated with the purchased company 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed 
we are dependant on recruiting and retaining a strong team of personnel across all functional areas 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain the additional highly qualified personnel necessary for our success 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
our relationships with these officers and key employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than our chief executive officer 
our efforts to increase our presence in markets outside of the united states may be unsuccessful and could result in losses 
we market and sell our products in the united states and internationally  principally europe and asia 
we have substantially grown our international operations in recent quarters and intend to continue this expansion 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources  and we cannot be sure that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside of the united states has varied substantially  reflecting the early stage build out of our international operations 
we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  other inherent risks may apply to international operations  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
we also have limited experience operating in foreign countries and managing multiple offices with facilities and personnel in disparate locations 
we may not be able to manage our resources effectively  coordinate our efforts  supervise our personnel or otherwise successfully manage our resources 
the laws and cultural requirements in foreign countries can vary significantly from those in the united states 
the inability to integrate our business in these jurisdictions and to address cultural differences may adversely affect the success of our international operations 
intellectual property claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect that software products may be increasingly vulnerable to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  and more business method patents are submitted to and issued by patent authorities 
we believe that many companies have filed or intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology that they may claim our technology infringes 
some of these companies have sent copies of their patents to us for informational purposes 
we cannot be sure that these parties will not make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  and could cause product shipment delays or require us to reengineer our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
reengineering a particular product  however  may not be possible or practical 
similarly  these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
anti takeover provisions contained in our charter and under delaware law could impair a takeover attempt 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law prohibiting  under some circumstances  publicly held delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock 
such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us  even if such events could be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of the stockholders 
in addition  such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in our control or management 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  announcements of technological alliances and partnerships  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
we limit our interest rate risks by placing our marketable securities investments with high quality issuers principally in united states government and corporate debt securities with terms of less than two years 
we do not expect any material losses from our marketable securities investments and believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
we sell our products and services in the united states and abroad 
historically  the percentage of sales to customers located outside the united states has varied substantially 
we currently transact substantially all of our revenues  whether domestic or abroad  in united states currency 
our expenditures and consolidated financial results could be affected by a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus a foreign currency
