we have continually enhanced our cobol analyst product line 
in fiscal  we acquired mozart systems corporation and its line of web enablement products  including moznet  mozagent  moznet  and mozwin 
we have integrated mozart s technology with our internally developed java component technology and seec re engineering workbench to form seec mosaic studio  a comprehensive legacy transformation toolkit that will be marketed beginning in fiscal we derive our revenues from software license and maintenance fees and professional services fees 
our software is licensed primarily to fortune companies  governmental organizations and third party service providers 
professional services are provided to customers in conjunction with the license of software products 
our enterprise solutions and software products and services are marketed through a broad range of distribution channels  including direct sales to end users  and to end users in conjunction with our partners 
we recognize software license fees upon receipt of a firm order  shipment of the software to the customer  and resolution of any material related obligations 
typically  software maintenance contracts are sold with software licenses 
revenues from software maintenance are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  which is generally one year 
software maintenance contracts are typically renewable on an annual basis  although we also enter into long term maintenance contracts from time to time 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are provided or upon the achievement of specified performance milestones

software license and maintenance fees were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
professional services revenues  consisting of consulting  training  and reengineering services fees  were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decreases in revenues resulted primarily from a slowdown in worldwide demand for year tools and solutions  which was partially offset by increasing sales of web enablement and legacy transformation solutions that were introduced in fiscal  including mozart products and services 
cost of revenues

cost of software license and maintenance fees was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the cost of software license and maintenance fees decreased with the declining demand for year products and solutions  which was partially offset by increases in costs related to sales of e business products 
the cost reductions were primarily in the areas of customer support personnel costs and royalties paid to third parties 
customer support costs declined with a fall in maintenance contract renewals  with customers having completed their year remediation projects 
professional services costs consist primarily of compensation and related costs  and travel and equipment for our personnel responsible for providing consulting  training  and reengineering services to customers 
also included are the costs of temporary or subcontracted labor required at times to meet the demands of providing services  particularly on large contracts

gross margins 
our total gross margin total revenues less total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal gross margin percentages were and for software license and maintenance fees  and and for professional services  for fiscal and  respectively 
the gross margin percentages for software license and maintenance fees fluctuate depending on the mix of software products and the varying royalty expenses  if any  associated with those products 
also  these percentages are impacted by the proportion of customer support services costs to the amount of software license and maintenance fees generated in a given period 
the gross margin percentages for software license and maintenance fees were lower in fiscal than in fiscal due to a higher proportion of the customer support service costs to revenues  largely due to the decrease in total revenues 
the gross margin percentages for professional services vary depending on the utilization rates for billable consultants  the timing and amount of costs incurred for recruiting and training services consultants  and the type of services provided 
relatively highly automated in house factory services typically require fewer consultant hours to perform and result in higher gross margin percentages than other services provided at the customers sites 
our pricing for professional services varies based on the complexity and scope of the engagement  and competitive considerations 
sales and marketing

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was due to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the august purchase of mozart  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development 
we recorded a one time charge of  during fiscal in connection with the acquisition of mozart  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the value of acquired research and development projects is charged to expense when  in management s opinion  the projects have not reached technological feasibility and have no probable alternative future use 
we did not incur any such charges in fiscal net interest income 
net interest income consists principally of interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments  which are invested in money market funds and high grade bonds and bond funds 
net interest income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in net interest income was due to a reduction in cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from the use of cash for the mozart acquisition  to fund operations  and for stock repurchases 
the effect of the reduced cash balances was partially offset by higher interest rates during fiscal income taxes 
the income tax provision benefit was  and  for fiscal and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
in fiscal  we calculated a net deferred tax asset  which was offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realization of our net operating loss carryforwards

the decrease in revenues resulted primarily from a decrease in the demand for year software tools  partially offset by a substantial increase in the demand for professional services 
software license and maintenance fees were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in software license and maintenance fees is attributable to a decrease in demand for year solutions 
also contributing to the decrease in software license and maintenance fee revenue is the one time revenue recognition of the  advance royalty from viasoft  a non recurring revenue item recognized in fiscal see business sales  marketing  and distribution and note to the consolidated financial statements 
professional services revenues consist of consulting  training and reengineering services fees related directly to product licenses  primarily for our year products  and contract programming services fees 
such revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to customers increased demand for on site assistance with their year projects  additional training and consulting services  typically provided in conjunction with software license sales  and additional in house assessment  renovation  and independent verification iv services performed at our offices 
in fiscal  more so than in fiscal  we provided extended term  on site services to customers on a time and materials basis 
either our employees or subcontracted professionals may deliver the on site services  depending on the nature of the engagements and staffing requirements 
our in house factory services revenues comprised a larger percentage of total revenues in fiscal than in fiscal we expect that training  consulting  and on site services will be the primary components of professional services revenue for the foreseeable future 
the increase in professional services revenues described above was partially offset by a decrease in contract programming services revenue 
we chose to direct our resources away from contract programming services  which were discontinued during fiscal we have no plans to continue to provide services of this type

cost of revenues includes cost of software license and maintenance fees and cost of professional services 
cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel costs of employees or subcontracted personnel required to provide consulting  training  on site or in house factory services  and customer support services 
also included are royalties that we paid to icici for each product sold or service provided  and to viasoft for certain products 
our total cost of revenues was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the primary reasons for the decrease in cost of revenues were the decrease in demand for year services and solutions and the elimination of royalties payable to icici and viasoft

professional services fees represented and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
software license and maintenance fees have higher gross margins than professional services fees 
gross margin percentages were and for software license and maintenance fees  and and for professional services  for fiscal and  respectively 
the gross margin percentages for software license and maintenance fees fluctuate depending on the mix of software products and the varying royalty expenses associated with those products 
the gross margin percentages for software license and maintenance fees and professional services were favorably impacted by the discontinuation after january of the royalties payable to icici 
the gross margin percentages for professional services vary depending on the type of services provided and the timing and amount of costs incurred to build up the professional services infrastructure 
services that are relatively highly automated  such as year assessments and iv  typically require fewer professional hours to perform than services involving planning  source code remediation or testing 
furthermore  our pricing for professional services varies based on the complexity and scope of the engagement and competitive considerations 
the professional services gross margin percentage in fiscal reflects the benefits of having a professional staff in place and in a revenue producing mode for the entire year 
in fiscal  additional costs were incurred for recruiting  hiring  training  and purchasing equipment for new professionals 
this divergence of costs and revenues in a particular period is likely to recur  therefore continuing to have a varying impact on gross margin percentages

the provision for income taxes was  and  for fiscal and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was affected by the availability of net operating loss carryforwards  which reduced our federal tax liability for fiscal and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and positive cash flows from operations

our cash balances may be used to develop international sales and marketing efforts  to expand domestic sales and marketing efforts  to establish additional facilities  to hire additional personnel  for increased research and development  for capital expenditures  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we may also utilize cash to develop or acquire other businesses  products or technologies complementary to our current business 
the amounts actually expended for each such purpose may vary significantly and are subject to change at our discretion  depending upon certain factors  including economic or industry conditions  changes in the competitive environment  and strategic opportunities that may arise 
we believe that cash flows from operations and the current cash balances will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
in the longer term  we may require additional sources of capital to fund future growth 
such sources of capital may include additional equity offerings or debt financings 
impact of inflation increases in the inflation rate are not expected to materially affect our operating results 
inflationary cost increases have not been material in recent years  and to the extent allowed in light of competitive pressures  such increases are passed on to customers through increased billing rates 
foreign currency translation the overall effects of foreign currency exchange rates on our business during the periods discussed have not been material 
movements in foreign currency exchange rates create a degree of risk to our operations if those movements affect the dollar value of costs incurred in foreign currencies 
the majority of our billings to date have been denominated in us dollars 
changing currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position if exchange rate changes impact profitability and business and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date 
expenses are translated using the average exchange rate during the period 
seasonality our operations are not affected by seasonal fluctuations 
our cash flows may at times fluctuate due to the timing of cash receipts from large individual sales

item a 
market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalent investments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  floating rate instruments that carry a degree of interest rate risk 
these instruments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
conversely  if interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income investments will likely be negatively impacted 
foreign currency risk 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on us has not been material
