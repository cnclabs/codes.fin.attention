the company does not anticipate incurring a loss on any individual apartment community sale 
proceeds from the sale of the communities will be used to fund future development 
the three apartment communities held for sale represented approximately of property operating income for the company for the year ended december  development activity the company s developments in process at december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands total estimated anticipated apartment estimated cost to cost to construction community homes costs date complete completion summit new albany ii columbus  oh    q summit largo largo  md   q summit hunter s creek orlando  fl    q summit deer creek atlanta  ga    q summit russett ii laurel  md    q summit ashburn farm loudon county  va    q summit grandview charlotte  nc    q reunion park by summit raleigh  nc    q summit deerfield cincinnati  oh    q summit crest raleigh  nc    q summit overlook raleigh  nc    q other development and construction costs  these communities were in lease up at december  consists primarily of land held for development and other predevelopment costs 
estimated cost to complete the development communities represents substantially all of the company s material commitments for capital expenditures at december certain factors affecting the performance of development communities the company is optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction  even with the increased supply of newly constructed apartment homes of comparable quality in many of its markets 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what it believes are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional costs or liabilities resulting from increased costs for materials or labor or other unexpected costs or defects in construction material  and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  the company is conducting feasibility and other pre development work for eleven communities 
the company could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that it determines that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms  or it is unable to obtain necessary permits and authorizations  or due to other circumstances which may prevent development 
similarly  there can be no assurance that  if the company does pursue one or more of these potential communities  that it will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
year the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems arise from the inability of some hardware and software to distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
the company s efforts to address its year issues prior to january   were focused in the following three areas i reviewing and taking any necessary steps to attempt to correct the company s computer information systems ie  software applications and hardware platforms  ii evaluating and making any necessary modifications to other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  hvac  elevator  fire and safety systems  and iii communicating with certain significant third party service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect the company 
the company has not experienced any business or service disruptions as a result of any year issues  nor has the company been contacted by any vendors or customers as to any year issues with respect to their various products or services 
costs incurred to date related to year issues have not been material  nor does the company expect to incur additional material costs related to year issues 
the company is continuing to evaluate potential disruptions or complications that might result in the future from year related problems  although at this time  the company has not identified any specific business functions that are likely to suffer material disruption as a result of year related issues 
due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  however  it is not possible to anticipate each of the wide variety of year issues that might arise  particularly outside of the company  which might have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations recurring capital expenditures 
the company s methodology for calculating ffo and fad may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and fad utilized by other real estate companies  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
ffo and fad do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital expenditures or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and fad should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make dividends distributions 
the company believes ffo and fad are helpful to investors as measures of the performance of the company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands net income    extraordinary items  net of minority interest minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership    gain on sale of real estate assets    adjusted net income    depreciation real estate assets    real estate joint venture funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    non recurring capital expenditures    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted    recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting  carpets in  new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  and wallpaper 
in contrast  non recurring capital expenditures  such as major improvements  new garages and access gates  are expected to be funded by financing activities and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of funds available for distribution 
the increase in recurring capital expenditures for the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s change in accounting policy to capitalize carpets starting january  without carpet  recurring capital expenditures for the year ended december  would have been million 
recurring capital expenditures for and have not been restated for the change in accounting policy 
non recurring capital expenditures for the year ended december  and primarily consisted of major renovations in the amount of million in and million in respectively   and  for access gates and security fences in and respectively   and million for water meters in and  respectively  million and million in other revenue enhancement expenditures in and  respectively 
recently enacted legislation the company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
recently enacted tax legislation alters the requirements for qualification as a reit 
among others  the newly passed legislation generally liberalizes  from the perspective of the company s historic operations  the asset diversification requirements applicable to reits 
effective for tax years beginning after december   a reit may own the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary without limitation on the reit s voting control over the subsidiary  provided that not more than of the value of the reit s total assets is represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
a taxable reit subsidiary would include a corporation in which the company directly or indirectly owns stock and which has elected to be treated as the company s taxable reit subsidiary 
the definition of taxable reit subsidiary in the internal revenue code limits the ability of corporations whose activities relate to lodging or health care to be taxable reit subsidiaries 
under current law  a reit must distribute at least of its real estate investment trust taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to its stockholders 
effective for tax years beginning after december   the recently enacted tax legislation reduces the percent of real estate investment trust taxable income that must be distributed to  exclusive of net capital gains
