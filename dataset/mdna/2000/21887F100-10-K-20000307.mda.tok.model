item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our objective is to be a leader in the discovery and commercialization of products to prevent  treat or diagnose autoimmune diseases  cancer  and certain infectious diseases 
our strategy consists of integrating our core antigen  adjuvant and antigen delivery technologies into a product pipeline focused on the immune system 
to implement this strategy  we establish corporate collaborations at various stages in the research and development process for product development and commercialization  including research  clinical development  obtaining regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing 
we believe that this research and partner driven approach will create significant scientific  operational and financial advantages and accelerate the commercial development of new therapeutic and prophylactic t cell vaccines and other immunotherapeutic products 
since inception  approximately of our revenue has resulted from these collaborative agreements  and approximately of our revenue has resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  collaborative agreements at various stages in the research and development process 
we believe that this active corporate partnering strategy enables us to maintain our focus on our fundamental strengths in vaccine discovery and research  capitalize on our corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  retain significant downstream participation in product sales  and reduce our financing requirements 
when entering into corporate partnering relationships  we seek to cover our research and development expenses through research funding  milestone payments  collaborative agreement credit lines  and technology or license fees 
also  we endeavor to retain significant downstream participation in product sales through either profit sharing or product royalties paid on annual net sales 
our significant collaborative agreements include the following zenyaku kogyo 
in august  we entered into a corporate partnership with zenyaku kogyo for research and development related to our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac 
the agreement provides zenyaku kogyo with exclusive rights to pvac treatment in japan  while we and our treatment discovery partner  genesis research and development limited  retain exclusive rights with respect to the rest of the world 
under the agreement  we will receive license fees and research funding of million  milestone payments based upon successful clinical and commercial progress  and a royalty stream on future product sales 
zambon group and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco 
during may and june  we entered into corporate partnerships with zambon group and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  respectively  for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine and antibody based products aimed at the prevention and or treatment of lung cancer 
zambon group has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in europe  the former countries of the soviet union  argentina  brazil and colombia and co exclusive rights with japan tobacco in china 
japan tobacco has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in the united states  japan and a co exclusive license in china 
we also granted zambon group a non exclusive license and japan tobacco an option to formulate vaccines that may result from the collaboration using our microsphere delivery system with our proprietary adjuvants 
the agreements have three year terms and  in the aggregate  provide us with committed research funding of million as well as milestone payments that vary depending on the milestones achieved 
in addition  zambon group purchased million of our common stock 
the agreement allows zambon group to sell the common stock back to us at the original price if the technology does not result in a commercial product at the end of the research program 
infectious disease research institute 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with the infectious disease research institute  or idri  to research and develop ex vivo therapies for the treatment of cancer 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  idri committed million over the three year term of the agreement to fund work in these areas 
the agreement provides us with exclusive rights to all intellectual property and product rights 
idri will receive a percentage of our proceeds related to ex vivo therapy products resulting from the research and development 
smithkline beecham 
during  we entered into a broad corporate partnership with smithkline beecham  smithkline beecham biologicals and smithkline beecham manufacturing for vaccine discovery for breast  prostate  ovarian and colon cancer  tuberculosis vaccine discovery and development programs  and vaccine discovery programs for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae 
we also have granted smithkline beecham an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  and sell vaccine products resulting from our clinical program based on her neu for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer and our preclinical program based on mammaglobin  a novel gene product associated with breast cancer 
for certain of these disease areas  we granted smithkline beecham rights to develop  manufacture and sell passive immunotherapy products 
these products include t cell  dendritic cell and antibody therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring products 
smithkline beecham has committed million to fund work in such discovery programs during the next four years 
we have also acquired the following companies ribi 
in october  we completed the acquisition of ribi immunochem research  a hamilton  montana based biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel agents that modulate the human immune response to prevent or treat certain diseases including infectious diseases  allergies  cancer and cardiovascular injury 
we purchased ribi for approximately million  consisting of  shares of our common stock and stock options valued in the aggregate at million  cash of million and transaction costs of approximately million 
we intend that the transaction qualify as a tax free reorganization and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
we recorded acquired in process research and development of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  including adjuvant know how of million  workforce of million and goodwill of million 
as part of our acquisition of ribi  we assumed responsibility as a potential responsible party in connection with groundwater contamination at the bitterroot valley sanitary landfill 
we have initiated settlement discussions with the united states and the state of montana and currently believe that a settlement can be reached releasing us from past and future liability related to the groundwater contamination 
we have reserved million to cover reasonably anticipated settlement costs 
if we incur costs in excess of this amount in resolving this action  our financial condition may suffer 
in addition  we assumed responsibility for an action brought against ribi by one of its former employees who alleged he was discharged in violation of the montana wrongful discharge from employment act and further that the discharge was for his refusal to violate public policy in connection with his employment 
although we believe our defenses to these allegations have merit  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in this matter 
if the former employee prevails on the public policy issue  we could be subject to punitive damages of an unknown amount 
anergen 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of anergen  a biotechnology company focused on the treatment of autoimmune diseases through the discovery and development of proprietary therapeutics that selectively interrupt the disease process 
we purchased anergen for approximately million  consisting of  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million  approximately  in cash  and transaction costs of approximately  we recorded acquired in process research and development of million 
we accounted for the acquisition as a purchase  and we intend that the transaction qualify as a tax free reorganization 
genquest 
in september  we completed the acquisition of genquest  a development stage biotechnology company focused on applying functional genomics technology to discover novel genes and develop the potential of these genes and related gene products to be used in diagnosis  drug screening  gene therapy and antibody development in the areas of prostate  breast  lung  colon  and ovarian cancer 
we purchased genquest for approximately million  consisting of  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million  cash of approximately million  and transaction costs of approximately  we recorded acquired in process research and development of million 
we accounted for the acquisition as a purchase  and we intend that the transaction qualify as a tax free reorganization 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of ribi  anergen and genquest 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over  at a minimum  the next several years 
these losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with our discovery  research and development programs  preclinical and clinical activities and the purchase of technology 
corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income have generated substantially all of our revenue to date 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations is dependent in large part upon entering into collaborative agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve consistent profitability 
in addition  because payments under collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements may vary significantly in both timing and amounts  we could experience quarters of profitability and quarters of losses 
therefore  our results of operations for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue our revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in we attribute the increase primarily to revenue from collaborative agreements with the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  zambon group  zenyaku kogyo and idri 
the revenue from the multi field agreement with smithkline beecham is the primary cause for the increase in over we received revenue under government grants in of million  more than the million received in  and up from  received in we expect our revenue to fluctuate in the future depending on our ability to enter into new collaborative agreements  obtain new government grants and uncertainty surrounding additional product sales 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll and personnel expenses due in part to acquisitions  increased collaboration and patent expenses  increased costs associated with preclinical activities and increased facilities costs as a result of the completion of our facility expansion in late the increase compared with resulted from increased payroll and personnel expenses  laboratory services and supplies  increased collaboration and patent expenses  increased consulting costs and increased amortization of deferred compensation associated with certain stock option grants 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as the level of our business activities continues to expand 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in these increases were primarily attributable to increased expenses related to payroll and personnel expenses due in part to acquisitions  legal fees  business development  and the general and administrative portions of the amortization of deferred compensation associated with certain stock option grants 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of our business activities 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended december   our acquired in process research and development ipr d expense increased to million from million in the million reflects the amount allocated to ipr d that we acquired in the ribi and anergen acquisitions compared to million acquired in the genquest acquisition during our acquired ipr d for each of the above acquisitions represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows that we expect to be generated by the purchased technology that  at the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
we based the cash flow projections for revenues on estimates of growth rates and the aggregate size of the respective markets for each product  probability of technical success given the stage of development at the time of acquisition  royalty rates based on prior licensing agreements  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
we deducted our estimated operating expenses and income taxes from our estimated revenue projections to arrive at our estimated after tax cash flows 
our projected operating expenses include general and administrative expenses and research and development costs 
the rate that we used to discount projected cash flows ranged from to for in process technologies  which we based primarily on venture capital rates of return and the weighted average cost of capital for us at the time of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  ribi s ipr d projects consisted of the following mpl  rc  melacine  detox and rc ribi is developing mpl  an adjuvant immunostimulant for potential application in vaccines 
ribi has estimated that the research and development costs to complete individual mpl vaccine development projects will be approximately million 
the mpl projects are in various stages of completion  from preclinical to phase iii 
ribi has scheduled the most advanced mpl project for completion in the year ribi has scheduled additional identified mpl projects in early development stages for completion by the year although ribi reported favorable results in phase iii clinical trials related to mpl in a hepatitis b vaccine  significant risk related to regulatory approval remains 
rc is a next generation synthetic adjuvant 
ribi plans to jointly develop a hepatitis b vaccine utilizing rc with a partner 
ribi has estimated that rc development will be completed in  requiring an additional million in research and development costs 
as of the acquisition date  ribi had made progress in the areas of preclinical work  including toxicology studies  comparative studies  and production scale up studies 
melacine vaccine is a therapeutic vaccine to treat melanoma 
ribi has estimated costs to complete melacine vaccine development at million  with a targeted completion date in although significant risks remain  melacine vaccine has completed two phase iii clinical trials and is currently in one other phase iii study 
detox has adjuvant properties  which ribi is currently developing for use in melacine vaccine 
in addition  biomira is developing detox for use in theratope as a therapeutic vaccine for breast  lung  gastrointestinal and colon cancer 
ribi has estimated remaining costs to complete development of detox at approximately  with completion planned for while significant risks remain to complete detox  phase iii trials have been started for its application in theratope  a product that contains detox adjuvant as a vaccine adjuvant 
rc is a synthetic compound that ribi is developing for use in protecting against reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or angioplasty 
ribi has targeted completion of rc development for with an additional million required in completion costs 
prior to our acquisition of ribi  ribi made significant progress related to preclinical work  including toxicology studies 
the fda has indicated that ribi could proceed to a phase ii iii clinical trial for rc with appropriate preclinical data 
subsequent to our acquisition of ribi  we received approval of melacine for the treatment of stage iv malignant melanoma in canada in november we also received preliminary data from a phase iii clinical trial for melacine for the treatment of stage ii malignant melanoma 
at the anergen acquisition date  anergen s ipr d projects were potential therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases that focus on destroying or inactivating t cells without affecting the protective functions of the immune system or stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that may interfere with the presentation of auto antigens to destructive t cells 
anervax 
ra  a potential product to treat rheumatoid arthritis  is the primary product 
anervax 
ra is a synthetic peptide vaccine consisting of a small portion of the human leukocyte antigen hla ii molecule 
anervax 
ra is designed to elicit an immune response that interferes with the presentation of auto antigens to t cells 
this immune response is intended to stimulate the production of the patient s own antibodies to a subset of the hla molecules on the patient s antigen presenting cells 
anervax 
ra peptide vaccine has completed a patient randomized phase ii double blinded clinical trial 
subsequent to our acquisition of anergen  we have received interim data from a phase i ii clinical trial for anergix 
ra in november at the genquest acquisition date  genquest s primary ipr d projects related to functional genomics technology to discover and develop novel genes and related gene products to be used in diagnosis and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
these potential products are in the areas of prostate  breast  lung  colon and ovarian cancer 
subsequent to the acquisition of genquest  and as a result of the acquisition  additional antigen based product rights have been granted to smithkline beecham  zambon group and japan tobacco 
also  in august  we entered into a license agreement with introgen therapeutics granting exclusive worldwide license to mda  a tumor suppressor gene that we have in licensed from columbia university 
the license was acquired through our acquisition of genquest 
we based all of the foregoing estimates and projections on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of the acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
if we do not successfully develop these projects  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as of the date of each acquisition  we concluded that once completed  the technologies under development can only be economically used for their specific and intended purposes and that such in process technologies have no alternative future use after taking into consideration the overall objectives of the project  progress toward the objectives  and uniqueness of developments to these objectives 
if the projects fail  the economic contribution expected to be made by the in process research and development will not materialize 
the risk of untimely completion includes the risk that competitors will develop alternative products 
interest income our interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in and up from million in the change in interest income is based on average investment balances during the year and market interest rates 
interest expense our interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   from  in and from  in the increase in each period was primarily attributable to higher loan and capital lease financing balances 
other income our other income increased to  for the year ended december   from  in and from  in other income in includes  and  in proceeds from the recovery of a collaboration receivable that was previously charged to expense and sublease rental receipts  respectively 
the and amounts include  and  and  and  in proceeds from management and administrative service agreements with genquest and idri  respectively 
we provided services to idri with respect to certain management  accounting and financial matters  record keeping  personnel administration and human resources  and treasury services as required by the agreement with idri 
we performed similar services under our agreement with genquest  which ended upon our acquisition of genquest in september effect of deferred compensation we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our deferred compensation represents the amortization of the difference between the exercise prices of options for  shares of common stock granted during the year ended december  and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the grant dates 
we will amortize the remaining balance of  over the remaining vesting period of two years 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments 
the october initial public offering and preceding private placements of equity securities have provided us with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
since inception  we have recognized approximately million of revenue under corporate partnerships and grants  have received million from the issuance of series a preferred stock under an equity line of credit  have drawn million on a bank loan and received million from credit lines under collaborative agreements 
since our inception in  our operations have used cash of approximately million 
during the same period  we have invested million in property and equipment and have acquired an additional million of equipment through capital lease financings 
in april  we entered into an agreement with castle gate  an investment partnership focusing primarily on health care and biomedical companies  to provide us with an equity line of credit of up to million 
under this agreement  castle gate is obligated to provide the equity line of credit through march we may draw down funds under the equity line of credit at our sole option and may use these funds for expenses in connection with various technology or company acquisitions 
when these funds are drawn down  we will issue castle gate shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of  per share and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
at the time we executed the castle gate agreement  we completed an initial draw down under the equity line of credit of million and a corresponding issuance to castle gate of  shares of our series a preferred stock convertible into common stock at per share and warrants to purchase up to a total of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have exercise prices of and per share 
on september   we obtained stockholder approval for any additional funds that we may elect to draw under the equity line of credit 
in the event we elect to draw down additional funds under the equity line of credit  each draw must be for a minimum of million 
we have no present intention to make any additional draws under the equity line of credit 
on the date of the initial draw  the effective conversion price of the preferred stock after allocating the portion of the proceeds to the common stock warrants based on the relative fair values was at a discount to the price of the common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible 
the discount of million was recorded as a preferred stock dividend 
in addition  we accrued  related to the annual cumulative dividend 
during the year ended december   we used million of net cash in our operations  compared to million in and  in our investing activities used million in  compared to million in and million in the increase was due primarily to the increased use of cash in the net activity of available for sale securities  partially offset by decreases in purchases of property and equipment and cash used in acquisitions 
the decrease compared with was due to purchases of available for sale securities in with the proceeds from our initial public offering in october our financing activities provided cash of million in compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to proceeds of million from our issuance of series a preferred stock partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from long term obligations 
the decrease in compared with is primarily a result of the proceeds from our initial public offering in october as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million in we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under our existing collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of capital will be sufficient for such period of time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued scientific progress in our discovery  research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  our ability to maintain existing  and enter into additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of acquiring companies with complementary technology  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products and other factors not within our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
however  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our discovery  research or development programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab among other things  sab discusses the sec staff s view on accounting for non refundable up front fees received in connection with collaboration agreements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sab on the accounting for up front fees received pursuant to certain collaboration agreements 
should we determine that a change in accounting policy is necessary  such changes will be made effective january  and would result in a change to results of operations for the cumulative effect of the change 
such amount  if recognized  would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue in future periods 
prior financial results would not be restated 
impact of year issues in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we incurred expenses of less than  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that we promptly address any latent year matters that may arise 
market risk disclosures we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
however  we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the united states government and fixed income investments which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
factors affecting future results you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report and the information incorporated by reference in this annual report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements 
we are at an early stage of development and have limited sources of revenue 
we are at an early stage in the development of our therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic products 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate partners  and we expect that most of our revenue for the foreseeable future will continue to result from corporate partnerships 
since our inception  we have generated only minimal revenue from diagnostic product sales and no revenue from therapeutic or prophylactic product sales 
we cannot predict when  if ever  our research and development programs will result in commercially available immunotherapeutic products 
we do not know when  if ever  we will receive any significant revenue from commercial sales of such products 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under existing corporate partnerships  and we may not be able to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may not achieve consistent profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception on september  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of ribi immunochem research  anergen and genquest 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with our acquisition activities  including the expenses associated with the write off of in process research and development  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
substantially all of our revenue and other income to date have resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
we may never achieve consistent profitability  and our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations is dependent in large part upon entering into agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products  and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
in addition  payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amounts 
accordingly  our results of operations for any period may fluctuate and may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
because our technology and product development are unproven  our business may not succeed 
our technological approach to the development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and other immunotherapeutic products for autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases is unproven in humans 
products based on our technologies are currently in the research  preclinical or clinical investigation stages and have not been demonstrated to be safe and effective in clinical settings 
currently  only a small number of our immunotherapeutic products have advanced to clinical trials 
only one of our corporate partners has conducted clinical trials that incorporate our proprietary microsphere delivery system 
in addition  with the exception of phase i her neu vaccine trials  we have not  nor have any of our corporate partners  conducted any clinical trials using our proprietary vaccine antigens for cancer or infectious diseases 
with the exception of the approval of melacine r vaccine in canada  we have not  nor has any other company  received regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialized  any therapeutic vaccines for the autoimmune diseases  cancer or infectious diseases that we target 
we may not be able to develop effective vaccines for such diseases within a reasonable time  if ever  and such vaccines may not be capable of being commercialized 
furthermore  our programs may not move beyond their current stages of development 
we may not successfully manage our growth or integrate potential future acquisitions 
we have recently completed several acquisitions of complementary technologies  product candidates and businesses 
in the future  we may acquire additional complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing these acquisitions has entailed and may in the future entail numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs which may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our own which may be difficult and costly  and integrating or completing the development and application of any acquired technologies which may disrupt our business and divert our management s time and attention  impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses or hire enough qualified personnel to staff any new or expanded operations  and increased amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets 
if we do not effectively manage our business or otherwise adapt to anticipated growth  our business and stock price may suffer 
commercialization of some of our potential products depends on corporate partners 
if our corporate partners are not successful  or if we are unable to find corporate partners in the future  our business may not succeed 
the success of our business strategy is largely dependent on our ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may result from this strategy 
we derived and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  from research and development and other funding under our existing corporate partnerships 
we have established relationships with various corporate partners  including smithkline beecham  the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  zambon group  zenyaku kogyo  schering plough and organon  among others 
the process of establishing corporate partnerships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
our discussions with potential partners may not lead to the establishment of new corporate partnerships on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are successful in establishing such corporate partnerships  they may never result in the successful development of our products or the generation of significant revenues 
some of our corporate partners have options to license certain aspects of our technology 
any of these corporate partners may not exercise their option to license such technology 
we have also entered into corporate partnerships with several companies for the development  commercialization and sale of diagnostic products incorporating our proprietary antigen technology 
these diagnostic corporate partnerships may never generate significant revenues 
because we generally enter into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  our success largely depends upon the performance of our corporate partners 
we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate partners to collaborative activities 
as a result  our corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization of our products 
if any corporate partner fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  or at all  our preclinical or clinical development related to such corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
also  our current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
in addition  disputes may arise with respect to ownership of technology developed under any such corporate partnership 
finally  our corporate partners may terminate any of our current partnerships  and we may not be able to negotiate additional corporate partnerships in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
management of our relationships with our corporate partners will require significant time and effort from our management team  coordination of our research with the research priorities of our corporate partners  effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects  and an ability to obtain and retain key management  scientific and other personnel 
our inability to license technology from third parties may impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
our success also depends on our ability to enter into licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to the development and commercialization of our or our partners products 
we have various license agreements that provide us rights to use technologies owned or licensed by third parties 
these license agreements generally allow us and our corporate partners to use the licensed technology in research  development and commercialization activities 
disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
additionally  many of our in licensing agreements contain milestone based termination provisions 
our failure or the failure of any of our corporate partners to meet any agreed milestones could allow the licensor to terminate an agreement 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  our current license agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if we cannot obtain or maintain licenses to technologies advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our products  we and our corporate partners may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
if we are not able to do so  we may be prevented from commercializing certain of our products and our business and stock price may suffer 
our stock price could be volatile 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts  preclinical and clinical activities  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies  changes in existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  changes in government regulations  progress of regulatory approvals  issuance of new or changed stock market analyst reports and or recommendations  economic and other external factors  operating losses by us  and fluctuations in our financial results and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock 
one or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market 
the proprietary rights underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and would reduce our ability to compete 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary positions by filing united states and foreign patent applications 
as of march   we owned or had licensed issued united states patents that expire at various times between may and may  as well as pending united states patent applications 
our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical field are still evolving 
accordingly  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents which are issued may not provide meaningful protection  we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our corporate partners may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our corporate partners  patents issued to other companies may harm our ability to do business  other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies  and other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary know how and confidential data and continue to explore further methods of protection 
while we require all employees  consultants  partners and customers to enter into confidentiality agreements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
any material leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
if third parties challenge the validity of our patents and proprietary rights  our business may suffer 
a substantial number of patents have issued  and an even larger number of patent applications have been filed  in the fields of immunology and molecular biology 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
however  our technologies may infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties 
this could result in our corporate partners and us being prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization of our technologies and product candidates 
this result would significantly harm our business 
we have licensed certain patent applications from southern research institute  or sri  related to our microsphere encapsulation technology 
two of these patent applications are currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the european patent office 
in one such opposition  the european patent office has revoked a previously issued european patent 
although sri has appealed this decision  it is uncertain whether sri will ultimately prevail in this or any other opposition proceedings 
as a result  these patents may not issue in europe  in which case our business may suffer 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our issued and licensed patents  protect trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our products  if any  in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
any of these outcomes would significantly harm our business 
if we are unable to secure additional funding  we would have to reduce or cease operations 
we require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  public or private debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
however  additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  a substantial number of payments to be made by our corporate partners and other licensors are dependent upon the achievement by us of development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve such milestones may significantly harm our future capital position 
additional equity financings could result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our research  development  preclinical or clinical programs or manufacturing efforts 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under existing corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  bank credit arrangements  equity credit lines  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
we may attempt to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of whom could impair our ability to compete 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success 
we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  or at all  and the failure to do so would significantly harm our business 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
we also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research  development or clinical strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and can generally expect such individuals to devote only limited amounts of time to our activities 
failure of any such persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist such companies in developing technologies that may compete with our products 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise in discovery  research and development  testing  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than us 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
many companies and institutions compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases  including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions  and research organizations 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  thereby preventing us from obtaining such technology on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we or our corporate partners do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we and our corporate partners will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  product price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than our corporate partners and us 
these competitive products may render our products obsolete 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter problems or delays which could result in lost revenue 
our current manufacturing facilities may not be sufficient to support our or our corporate partners needs for clinical quantities of our products and commercial quantities of our current adjuvant products 
we have limited experience producing commercial quantities of any product  or in producing clinical grade or commercial amounts of our proprietary antigens 
although we currently manufacture limited quantities of some antigens and several adjuvants  we may rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce larger quantities of such substances for clinical trials and product commercialization 
we and these contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture our proprietary antigen vaccines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers also may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with such manufacturers  our preclinical and clinical testing would be delayed  thereby delaying submission of products for regulatory approval  or the market introduction and commercial sale of such products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices gmp regulations enforced by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of such manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our products will not be granted 
because we lack sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  our business may suffer 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
we intend to rely on our corporate partners to market our products 
our corporate partners may not have effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if we are unable to maintain or establish such relationships and are required to market any of our products directly  we will need to build a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to maintain or establish such relationships with third parties or build in house sales and distribution capabilities 
because our success depends on our products being approved through a government regulatory approval process that is uncertain  time consuming and expensive  our business may suffer 
any products we or our corporate partners develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product we or our corporate partners develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product in order to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
data from a recently completed phase iii clinical trial of melacine  our melanoma vaccine  showed no statistically significant therapeutic benefit on patients who met the criteria for treatment in connection with the trial 
we are currently reviewing  together with our corporate partner for this product  what additional studies  if any  will be conducted for this product 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances would adversely affect the marketing of any products we or our corporate partners develop  could impose significant additional costs on us or our corporate partners  would diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the approved product may be marketed 
these limitations could reduce the size of the potential market for such product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
further  manufacturers of approved products are subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with detailed regulations governing gmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
as part of our acquisition of ribi  we assumed responsibility as a potential responsible party in connection with groundwater contamination at the bitterroot valley sanitary landfill 
we have initiated settlement discussions with the united states and the state of montana and currently believe that a settlement can be reached releasing us from past and future liability related to the groundwater contamination 
we have reserved million to cover reasonably anticipated settlement costs 
if we incur costs in excess of this amount in resolving this action  our financial condition may suffer 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that might have an adverse effect on the development  production and marketing of our products 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
our business may be harmed by the cost of such compliance 
we face product liability exposure and potential unavailability of insurance 
we may experience losses due to product liability claims 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage 
such coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost  or at all 
we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claim  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  may significantly harm our business 
if we cannot successfully develop our products  or if our products are not accepted by the market  we will not generate revenue and our business will suffer 
development of therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic products is subject to risks of failure inherent in their development or commercial viability 
also  physicians  patients or the medical community generally may not accept or utilize any products that may be developed by our corporate partners or us 
these risks include the possibility that any such products will be found unsafe  be found to be ineffective  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult or impossible to manufacture on a large scale  be uneconomical to market  fail to be developed prior to the successful marketing of similar products by competitors  be impossible to market because they infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties or compete with products marketed by third parties that are superior  not be as effective as alternative treatment methods  and not qualify for reimbursement from government and third party payors 
any products successfully developed by us or our corporate partners  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
such products will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by other major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
if we do not successfully develop and market our products  we will not generate revenue and our business will suffer 
we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement and health care reform 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our or our corporate partners products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other health care related organizations 
both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care 
existing regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may also change before any of our or our corporate partners products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we or any of our corporate partners may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  including pharmaceuticals 
our or our corporate partners products  if any  may not be considered cost effective or adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us or our corporate partners to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investment 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
following this offering  our directors  entities affiliated with our directors  and our executive officers will beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding capital stock 
these stockholders as a group may be able to influence our management and affairs and  if acting together  may be able to influence most matters requiring the approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transaction 
the concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change of control of corixa at a premium price if these stockholders oppose it 
state laws and our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial for stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as provisions of delaware and washington law  will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial for our stockholders
