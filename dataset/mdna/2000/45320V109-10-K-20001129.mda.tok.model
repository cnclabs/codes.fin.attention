the loan is secured by  among other things  inventory  trade receivables  equipment and a personal guarantee of marshall sorokwasz  our chairman of the board and president  and trustee of a trust which is a principal shareholder of our company 
available borrowings under this line of credit  which accrues interest at the prime rate of interest plus at august   are based upon specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
in march  tst amended its revolving line of credit to increase the line from million to million 
the amended loans available borrowings of eligible inventories is limited by a staggered declining cap based upon certain dates

the revolving credit line will mature in may on november   tst entered into a loan agreement with a commercial financial corporation to co fund the construction of a new building and the refinance of the mortgage of its existing facility in west virginia

the expansion building was constructed on tst s property adjacent to its west virginia plant 
the new building  which was completed in may and is  square feet  stores inventory 
the additional debt incurred at the conclusion of the construction was approximately  maturing in we believe that the funds available under the loan and loan commitment for the addition to our west virginia facility  the revolving credit facility  cash and cash equivalents  trade credit and internally generated funds will be sufficient to satisfy our requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
such belief is based on certain assumptions  including the continuation of current operations and no extraordinary adverse events  and there can be no assurance that such assumptions are correct 
in addition  expansion of our operations due to an increased demand for products tst manufactures or significant growth of hotsheet 
com  inc may require us to obtain additional capital to add new operations or manufacturing facilities 
if that should occur  the funds required for the new facilities would be generated through securities offerings or additional debt 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available if needed  or  if available  will be on acceptable terms 
as of august   we did not own derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not use financial instruments and  therefore  do not expect the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to have a material impact on our financial position or results operations 
impact of inflation inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements about our prospects for the future  including but not limited to our ability to generate sufficient working capital  our ability to continue to maintain sales to justify capital expenses  and our ability to generate additional sales to meet business expansion 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including availability of raw materials  availability of thermal facsimile  computer  laser and color ink jet paper  to the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  the potential of technological changes which would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact the large inventory we require  loss of any significant customer  and termination of contracts essential to our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rates  but are exposed to risks such as variable interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our subsidiaries do not have supply contracts with any of their foreign vendors 
all foreign vendors are paid in united states currency 
in addition  tst s international sales of finished goods is insignificant 
accordingly  there are not sufficient factors to create a material foreign exchange rate risk  therefore  we do not use exchange commitments to minimize the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we had both fixed rate and variable rate debts as of august  the fair market value of long term variable interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally the fair market value of variable interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates fall and increase as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term fixed rate and floating rate debt approximates fair value 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
based upon our market risk sensitive debt outstanding at august   there was no material exposure to our financial position or results of operations
