the company had working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
included in current liabilities as of december  and were amounts related to earn out payments due to the former owners of acquired companies 
the earn out amounts were scheduled to be paid in the first and second quarters of fiscal and  respectively  and were capitalized to the goodwill balances related to the respective acquired companies 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the restructuring plan 
the principal reason for the increase in the company s working capital is the company s recognition of a million current tax liability as of december  relating to the sale of its commercial operations and teleservices division 
the company used proceeds from borrowings under its credit facility to pay the tax liability

the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the company generated million and million of cash flow from operations  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company used million of cash for operations 
the large increases in cash flows from operations year over year are due to the cash flow provided from internal operations  as well as from acquired companies 
the majority of the company s acquisitions occurred throughout the years ended december  and due to the timing of the acquisitions  the cash flow from operations has increased during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company used million of cash for investing activities  primarily as a result of taxes and other expenses related to the company s sale of the commercial businesses  of million

in connection with the company s sale of its health care operations  the company entered into an agreement with the purchaser of the health care operations whereby the company agreed to make advances to the purchaser to fund its working capital requirements

the company  pursuant to the asap  agreed to compensate the brokerage firm for any increases in the company s stock price that would cause the brokerage firm to pay an amount to purchase the stock over the asap price 
conversely  the company would receive a refund in the purchase price if the company s stock price fell below the asap price 
subsequent to december   the company used refunded proceeds from the asap to complete the program during january and february  with the repurchase of approximately  shares  bringing the total shares repurchased under the program to approximately  shares for approximately million

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
 deferring the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   and cannot be applied retroactively 
we have not yet quantified the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on our financial statements  however  sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income once adopted 
other matters year compliance 
the year issue was the result of computer programs whether related to it systems or non it systems being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
there were concerns that computer programs with time sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year rather than the year in preparation for such possibilities  the company assembled a year compliance team to address such matters company wide 
the company  to date  has not observed any instances that would indicate that the company s efforts in addressing the year issue were not successful 
the financial impact of addressing the year issue had no material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as to non it systems and vendor services  other than banking relationships and utilities which includes electrical power  water and related items  there is no single system or vendor service that is material to the company s operations 
as to banking needs  our banking relationships are primarily with large national and international financial institutions that addressed their own year compliance procedures and certified their compliance to the company 
certain of our utility vendors certified their year compliance to the company 
the company established a contingency plan  which ensured the needed back up utility sources necessary to maintain the critical information systems at the corporate headquarters 
utility failures at the company s branch offices or the inability of the company s customers to operate  which did not occur  could have had a material adverse effect on revenue sources and could have disrupted customers payment cycle 
the costs of year compliance project for each matter individually and all matters in the aggregate were not material to our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of the company s market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and other credit risks 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term and long term debt obligations and to the company s investments 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  government securities  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities  when acquired  of days or less 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
the company constantly evaluates its invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s short term and long term debt obligations totaled million as of december  and the company had million available under its current credit facility 
the debt obligations consist of notes payable to former shareholders of acquired corporations  are at a fixed rate of interest  and extend through august the interest rate risk on these obligations is thus immaterial due to the dollar amount and fixed nature of these obligations 
the interest rate on the credit facility is variable 
foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate changes impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the company generated approximately of fiscal consolidated revenues from international operations  approximately of which were from the united kingdom 
the united kingdom s currency has not fluctuated materially against the united states dollar in fiscal see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for effect of foreign currency translation adjustments on net income 
the company did not hold or enter into any foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  the proposed distribution of the information technology business the distribution of the information technology business is subject to market and other conditions  including a determination that the distribution is tax free to the company and its shareholders 
accordingly  there is some risk that the distribution will not take place 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock may decline if not distributing the information technology business is perceived as adversely impacting the company s focus and market position 
conversley  there can be no assurance that if the proposed distribution does occur that the price of the company s common stock will not decline after taking into account the value of any securities received in the distribution 
effect of fluctuations in the general economy demand for the company s professional business services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity in the markets served by the company 
during periods of slowing economic activity  companies may reduce the use of outside consultants and staff augmentation services prior to undertaking layoffs of full time employees 
as a result  any significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company may also be adversely effected by consolidations through mergers and otherwise of main customers or between major customers with non customers 
these consolidations as well as corporate downsizings may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by such customers for the company s services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
competition the company s industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
the company faces significant competition in the markets that it serves and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market in which the company operates  it competes for both clients and qualified professionals with other firms offering similar services 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment and higher wage costs  which puts pressure on gross margins 
ability to recruit and retain professional employees the company depends on its ability to recruit and retain employees who possess the skills  experience and or professional certifications necessary to meet the requirements of the company s clients 
competition for individuals possessing the requisite criteria is intense  particularly in certain specialized professional skill areas 
the company often competes with its own clients in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will be available and recruited in sufficient numbers on economic terms acceptable to the company 
ability to continue acquisition strategy  ability to integrate acquired operations the company has experienced significant growth in the past through acquisitions 
although the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acquisitions on economic terms acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and integrate all acquired operations into the company 
possible changes in governmental regulations from time to time  legislation is proposed in the united states congress  state legislative bodies and by foreign governments that would have the effect of requiring employers to provide the same or similar employee benefits to consultants and other temporary personnel as those provided to full time employees 
the enactment of such legislation would eliminate one of the key economic reasons for outsourcing certain human resources and could significantly adversely impact the company s staff augmentation business 
in addition  the company s costs could increase as a result of future laws or regulations that address insurance  benefits or other employment related matters 
there can be no assurance that the company could successfully pass any such increased costs to its clients
