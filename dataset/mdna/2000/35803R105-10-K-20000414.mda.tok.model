produce is usually acquired for delivery within four days  and the company generally does not operate under contractual supply agreements for its produce 
although purchases by fresh america frequently constitute a significant portion of a particular supplier s sales  no single supplier accounts for more than ten percent of fresh america s costs of goods sold

because most of the products delivered by the company are perishable  proper handling  including maintenance of constant temperature and humidity  is critical to the control of product spoilage
