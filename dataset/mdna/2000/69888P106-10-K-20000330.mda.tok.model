operating losses in fiscal year of  were reduced considerably from  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
revenue and margin growth were obtained primarily through a more favorable pricing environment in the market  reversing prior year trends of price erosion on certain products  and additional sales from new products 
operating expenses in fiscal year increased over fiscal years and due to additional emphasis on product development and marketing 
operating expenses in fiscal year included a non recurring charge of  for asset impairment of the congers facility resulting from outsourcing its production volume and subsequently leasing the facility to halsey 
the company incurred net losses of   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal years and net results included non recurring income of approximately  and  respectively  from the sale and release of product rights to elan 
fiscal year net results also included a gain of approximately  on the sale of sano corporation common stock see notes to financial statements distribution and supply agreements elan corporation 
in december  the company changed its annual reporting period to a fiscal year ending december from a fiscal year ending september and  accordingly  reported results for the three month transition period 
the operating loss in the transition period was  compared to  for the corresponding three month period ended december  although the company experienced net sales growth in the transition period  compared to the corresponding period of the prior year  primarily from sales of new products  the gross margin declined significantly due to unfavorable manufacturing variances and additional inventory write offs 
in addition  increased product development activity and higher selling and administrative expenses  as described below  adversely impacted the operating results for the transition period 
during the transition period  the company began implementing certain measures  including discontinuing its manufacturing of certain unprofitable products  in an attempt to reduce operating losses 
accordingly  the company recorded charges of  in the transition period for asset impairment and restructuring  and  of additional inventory reserves see notes to financial statements commitments  contingencies and other matters asset impairment restructuring 
as part of recent restructuring designed to increase operating efficiencies and improve operating results  the company has reduced its work force  discontinued certain unprofitable manufactured products  discontinued manufacturing at two under utilized facilities and subsequently leased  with an option to purchase  one such facility 
the company plans to continue to search for additional measures to improve results  including pursuing new products through joint ventures  and distribution and other agreements with pharmaceutical companies located throughout the world 
if gross margin levels are not increased by sales of more profitable products or volume increases and favorable pricing on existing products  the company will continue to experience losses 
in order to improve the company s prospects through the introduction of new products at profitable pricing and strengthen its financial condition  the company entered into a strategic alliance with merck kgaa  which was completed on june  as part of the alliance  the company sold common stock to a subsidiary of merck kgaa and received exclusive united states distribution rights for up to approximately generic pharmaceutical products covered by the genpharm distribution agreement 
to date  ten of such products have received fda approval and are currently being marketed by par 
the remaining products are either being developed  have been identified for development  or have been submitted to the fda for approval 
there are currently andas for nine potential products covered by the genpharm distribution agreement  one of which has been tentatively approved  pending with and awaiting approval from  the fda 
the company anticipates introducing several of these products in genpharm pays the research and development costs associated with the products and the company is obligated to pay genpharm a certain percentage of the gross margin on sales of the products 
the alliance provides the company with a significant number of potential products for its development pipeline without the substantial resource commitment  including financial  it would normally take to develop such a pipeline  improved financial condition and access to merck kgaa s expertise and experience in the industry see notes to financial statements strategic alliance and distribution and supply agreements genpharm  inc 
critical to any significant improvement in the company s financial condition is the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate significant gross margin 
in addition to additional product introductions expected as part of the strategic alliance with merck kgaa  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development efforts  subject to liquidity concerns  and pursue additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements 
the company is engaged in efforts  subject to fda approval and other factors  to introduce new products as a result of its research and development efforts and distribution and development agreements 
no assurance can be given that the company will obtain any additional products for sale or that sales of additional products will reduce losses or return the company to profitability 
continuing operating losses will have a materially adverse affect on the company s liquidity and  accordingly  limit its ability to fund research and development or ventures relating to the sale of new products and market existing products see financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
the generic drug industry in the united states continues to be highly competitive 
the factors contributing to the intense competition and affecting both the introduction of new products and the pricing and profit margins of the company  include  among other things i introduction of other generic drug manufacturer s products in direct competition with the company s significant products  ii consolidation among distribution outlets  iii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent expiration  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits  and iv willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among pharmaceutical manufacturers see business marketing and customers and competition

net sales in fiscal year of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  increased to approximately of the company s net sales compared to approximately of net sales in fiscal year  continuing the trend of greater reliance on sales of distributed products 
the increased percentage of distributed product sales is primarily due to increased sales of products manufactured under the supply agreement with basf

any inability by suppliers to meet expected demand could adversely affect future sales

net sales for the transition period of  increased  or  from net sales of  for the three month period ended december  the sales growth was primarily attributable to sales of new products  primarily the transdermal nicotine patch manufactured by elan and naproxen sodium manufactured by the company and introduced in october net sales of distributed product for the transition period increased to approximately of the company s total net sales compared to approximately of the total for the same period of the prior year 
net sales for fiscal year of  increased  or  from  for fiscal year the sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales of two distributed products manufactured by basf under the supply agreement and the introduction of three new products  the transdermal nicotine patch manufactured by elan  zorprin r manufactured by basf  and the first product distributed by the company under the genpharm distribution agreement

the gross margin for fiscal year was  of net sales compared to  of net sales for fiscal year the gross margin improvement was primarily due to increased margin contributions from higher margin products manufactured by basf under the supply agreement and the introduction of three new products 
the improvements more than offset the continuing lower selling prices and decreased volumes of certain significant manufactured products  unfavorable manufacturing variances caused by a shift in production of the largest volume manufactured product from the congers facility to basf during the latter part of fiscal year  and additional inventory write offs resulting from discontinued and slow moving products

one such product  the transdermal nicotine patch whose product rights had been sold effective may   was not sold in fiscal year the transdermal nicotine patch accounted for approximately of net sales in each fiscal year and  of net sales in the transition period and a significant portion of the gross margin in those respective periods 
although the termination of the distribution rights for the transdermal nicotine patch in fiscal year is expected to negatively affect the company s gross margin  it is anticipated that the gross margins generated by sales of new products in may offset this expected decrease
