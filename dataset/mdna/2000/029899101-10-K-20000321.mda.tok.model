item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless specifically noted  the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets 
there are no material differences between the consolidated operations and assets of awr and the operations and assets of scw 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in this report including the documents incorporated herein by reference are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as registrant believes  anticipates  expects or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe registrant s future plans  objectives  estimates or goals are also forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  liquidity and capital resources  opportunities related to operations of municipally owned water systems and accounting matters 
actual results in each case could differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as utility restructuring  including ongoing local  state and federal activities  future economic conditions  including changes in customer demand  future climatic conditions  legislative  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs 
results of operations years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in increased by to per share as compared to per share for the comparable period of the increase in the recorded results primarily reflects higher revenues at the scw unit during as is more fully discussed below 
water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in water sales volumes in were higher than due primarily to the much drier and warmer weather conditions throughout southern california in than in additional increases in revenues were due to the general rate increases in six of registrant s customer service areas effective january   which were applicable to of scw s water customers 
electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to a increase in kilowatt hour sales  primarily by industrial power users 
the sales increase was partially offset by the lower billing rates of industrial customers relative to residential customers 
other revenues increased from  to  in due to increased management fees resulting from new asus service contracts established in the year and increased activities with existing contracts 
purchased water costs in increased to million as compared to million in due to a increase in volumes purchased 
the increase also reflects reduced reimbursements in from potentially responsible parties related to groundwater contamination in scw s culver city customer service area of approximately  compared with reimbursements of million in see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation environmental matters matters relating to culver city system 
costs of power purchased for pumping increased by to million in chiefly as a result of an increase in pumped groundwater in scw s water supply mix due to increased sales volumes 
costs of power purchased for resale in increased by to million from the million recorded in due primarily to additional energy demand charges from the energy supplier serving scw s bear valley electric service unit in as described below  most of this increase has been included in the supply balancing account and that registrant will seek to recover these in future rate increases 
groundwater production assessments decreased by to million in from million in due to reduced quantity rates in scw s metropolitan and san dimas customer service areas 
a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
in  recovery of previously under collected supply costs was lower than due to the previously discussed increase in energy demand charges  the effect of which was partially offset by new rates effective january authorized to implement new supply costs and to increase collection of previously under collected costs 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit cost of supply costs which are outside of the immediate control of registrant 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in the actual supply mix as compared to that mix authorized for recovery in rates 
in  scw s overall supply mix improved favorably over that mix authorized in rates resulting in additional income 
there is no assurance that the favorable mix can be sustained in future periods since actual results are affected by availability and quality of water  both purchased and produced from scw s wells 
see the section entitled water supply 
other operating expenses increased by from the million recorded in due to increased costs for water treatment  and higher uncollectible provisions as a result of increased revenues 
administrative and general expenses increased by to million in from the million recorded in the increase is due to costs associated with various acquisition projects  increased employee benefit costs  and additional amounts reserved for certain legal proceedings 
in  maintenance expense increased to the million level compared to the recorded million in due principally to increased maintenance on registrant s water supply sources  and costs incurred on main replacements 
the wet weather conditions during the first part of also hampered planned maintenance activities  thereby reducing maintenance expense in depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  depreciation on which began in taxes on income increased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in due to a increase in pre tax income and a higher effective tax rate in resulting from the turn around of depreciation related temporary differences  the benefits of which were previously flowed through for ratemaking purposes 
property and other taxes increased by in to million due primarily to increased franchise fees resulting from higher revenues  and increased payroll taxes from higher wages and additional personnel 
other income decreased by in due primarily to the flow through of tax benefits related to refinancing of long term debt in december for which there were no similar benefits in interest expense increased by to million primarily due to the issuance of million in long term debt in january  partially offset by the retirement of million of notes in december years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in increased by to per share as compared to per share in although wet weather significantly impacted revenues in  lower supply costs and modest increases in other operating expenses partially offset the decline in revenues 
water operating revenues decreased by in to million from the million reported in water sales volumes in were lower than due to extremely wet weather during the first half of the year 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by rate increases effective during electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to the impact of a general rate increase effective january  as well as a increase in kilowatt hour sales 
purchased water costs decreased in to million as compared to million in due to a decrease in volumes purchased and refunds received from registrant s wholesale water supplier during of approximately million 
refunds of million were received in costs of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million in chiefly as a result of reduced energy costs from registrant s suppliers 
costs of power purchased for resale in decreased by to million from the million recorded in due to reduced costs from registrant s energy providers offset by the effects of increased kilowatt hour sales volumes recorded during the year 
groundwater production assessments increased by to million in from million in due to the increased amounts of pumped water in registrant s supply mix as well as additional assessments associated with increased pumping in registrant s metropolitan and orange county customer service areas 
a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
in  recovery of previously under collected supply costs was lower than due to the expiration  in january  of a surcharge designed to recover those costs 
the new rates  effective january  increased collection of these under collected costs 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit cost of supply costs which are outside of the immediate control of registrant 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in supply mix  as occurred during the first eight months of other operating expenses increased by from the million recorded in due to employee time charged to this category 
reversals in of costs associated with recovery of water quality expenditures through the cpuc s memorandum account mechanism also contributed to the increase 
there were no such reversals of equal magnitude in administrative and general expenses decreased slightly by to million in from the million recorded in the decrease is due to stability in costs associated with health insurance  post retirement medical benefits  pension and k plan costs and to a reduction of time charged by employees to this category 
in  maintenance expense remained at approximately the million level recorded in due principally to the wet weather conditions during the first part of that hampered planned maintenance activity 
depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  depreciation on which began in in addition  amortization of start up and organizational costs associated with the formation of awr is reflected in and there were no similar amortization costs in taxes on income increased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in due to a increase in operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 
property and other taxes decreased by in to million due primarily to reduced franchise tax payments directly attributable to reduced revenues 
other income increased by in due principally to the flow through of tax benefits related to refinancing of long term debt which was partially offset by an increase in reserves against costs associated with a non regulated joint venture 
interest expense increased by to million primarily due to increased short term bank borrowing and the issuance of million in long term debt in march liquidity and capital resources awr funds its operating expenses  dividends on its outstanding common and preferred shares  and makes its mandatory sinking fund payments  principally through dividends from scw 
awr has filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for issuance  from time to time  of up to million in common shares  preferred shares and or debt securities 
the proceeds will be used primarily for investment in its subsidiaries 
no securities had been issued under this registration statement as of december  scw funds the majority of its operating expenses  interest payments on its debt and dividends on its outstanding common shares through internal sources 
scw continues to rely on external sources  including short term bank borrowing  contributions in aid of construction  advances for construction and install and convey advances  to fund the majority of its construction expenditures 
because of the seasonal nature of its water and electric operations  scw utilizes its short term borrowing capacity to finance current operating expenses 
the aggregate short term borrowing capacity available to scw under its three bank lines of credit was million as of december   of which a total of million was outstanding 
scw routinely employs short term bank borrowing as an interim financing source prior to funding capital expenditures on a long term basis 
in  scw filed a registration statement with the sec for issuance  from time to time  of up to million in long term debt 
in january  scw issued million of long term debt pursuant to this registration statement  leaving million remaining for issuance at a later date 
the funds were used primarily to repay short term bank borrowings  after which capital expenditures were funded 
registrant has no derivative financial instruments  financial instruments with significant off balance sheet risks or financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk 
construction program a program for water pipeline replacement is on going throughout the customer service areas  based on priority of leaks detected  fire protection enhancements and reflection of the underlying replacement schedule 
in addition  general upgrades in scw s water supply facilities are anticipated to be on going 
scw s board of directors has approved anticipated net capital expenditures of million in neither awr nor asus have material capital commitments  however  asus actively seeks opportunities to own  lease or operate municipal water and wastewater systems  which may involve significant capital commitments 
regulatory matters scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc  which has broad powers with respect to service and facilities  rates  classifications of accounts  valuation of properties  the purchase  disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service  the issuance of securities  the granting of certificates of convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters 
awr and asus are not regulated by the cpuc 
the cpuc does  however  regulate certain transactions between scw and its non regulated affiliates 
the customer service areas csas of scw are grouped into water districts and electric district for ratemaking purposes 
water rates vary among the ratemaking districts due to differences in operating conditions and costs 
scw monitors operations on a regional basis in each of these districts so that applications for rate changes may be filed  when warranted 
under the cpuc s practices  rates may be increased by three methods general rate case increases grc s  offsets for certain expense increases and advice letter filings related to certain plant additions 
grc s are typically for three year periods  which include step increases for the second and third year 
rates are based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs 
grc s have a typical regulatory lag of one year 
offset rate increases typically have a two to four month regulatory lag 
the following table lists information on estimated annual rate changes during  and in s supply balancing general cost account and step advice year offset amortization increases letters total new water rates for six of scw s customer service areas and recovery of costs associated with scw s general office functions were implemented in january  step increases in rates for arden cordova  bay point and los osos csas were also effective in january  applications to increase water rates were filed for four water ratemaking districts in scw s region iii in march a draft decision has been issued by the administrative law judge assigned to this matter that supports the settlement on all issues reached between scw and the cpuc staff 
scw has also filed an application with the cpuc to combine tariff schedules into regional rates for the customer service areas that make up scw s region iii 
the administrative law judge assigned to this matter has issued a draft decision that supports scw s application 
a final decision from the cpuc on both issues is anticipated in the second quarter of grc step increase for metropolitan csa and general office allocation step increases for arden cordova  bay point  simi valley and santa maria csas were effective beginning january  attrition increases for arden cordova and bay point csas were also in effect beginning january  a notice of intent to increase water rates by approximately million for ratemaking districts in scw s region i as well as to combine those tariff schedules into regional rates were filed in february the application will be submitted by end of march  the new rates  if authorized in total or in part by the cpuc  would be effective january  an advice letter was filed with the cpuc on march  seeking recovery of capital expenditures associated with yk readiness  not already included in registrant s water rates 
see note to the notes to financial statements 
on april   the cpuc issued an order denying scw s application seeking approval of its recovery through rates of costs associated with its participation in the coastal aqueduct extension of the state water project swp 
scw s participation in the swp commits it to a year entitlement 
scw s investment of approximately million in swp is currently included in other property and investments 
the remaining balance of the related liability of approximately million is recorded as other long term debt 
scw intends to recover its investment in swp through contributions from developers on a per lot or other basis  or the sale of its acre foot entitlement in swp

environmental matters amendments to federal safe drinking water act on august   amendments the sdwa amendments to the safe drinking water act the sdwa were signed into law 
the sdwa revised the amendments to the sdwa with a new process for selecting and regulating contaminants 
the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa can only regulate contaminants that may have adverse health effects  are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern  and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction 
the epa has published a list of contaminants for possible regulation and must update that list every five years 
in addition  every five years  the epa must select at least five contaminants on that list and determine whether to regulate them 
the new law allows the epa to bypass the selection process and adopt interim regulations for contaminants in order to address urgent health threats 
current regulations  however  remain in place and are not subject to the new standard setting provisions 
the dohs  acting on behalf of the epa  administers the epa s program in california 
the sdwa amendments allow the epa for the first time to base primary drinking water regulations on risk assessment and cost benefit considerations and on minimizing overall risk 
the epa must base regulations on best available  peer reviewed science and data from best available methods 
for proposed regulations that involve the setting of maximum contaminant levels mcl s  the epa must use  and seek public comment on  an analysis of quantifiable and non quantifiable risk reduction benefits and cost for each such mcl 
scw currently tests its wells and water systems according to requirements listed in the sdwa 
water from wells found to contain levels of contaminants above the established mcls is treated to reduce contaminants to acceptable levels before it is delivered to customers 
since the sdwa became effective  scw has experienced increased operating costs for testing to determine the levels  if any  of the constituents in scw s sources of supply and additional expense to lower the level of any contaminants in order to meet the mcl standards 
such costs and the costs of controlling any other contaminants may cause scw to experience additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs 
registrant is currently unable to predict the ultimate impact that the sdwa amendments might have on its financial position or its results of operation 
the cpuc ratemaking process provides scw with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs associated with water quality 
management believes that such incurred costs will be authorized for recovery by the cpuc 
proposed enhanced surface water treatment rule on july   the epa proposed an enhanced surface water treatment rule eswtr which would require increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination 
the epa has proposed several versions of the eswtr for promulgation 
the version selected for promulgation will be determined based on data collected by certain water suppliers and forwarded to the epa pursuant to epa s information collection rule  which requires such water suppliers to monitor microbial and other contaminants in their water supplies and to conduct certain tests in respect of such contaminants 
the epa has adopted an interim eswtr applicable only to systems serving greater than  persons 
the long term eswtr  in any of the forms currently proposed  would apply to each of scw s five surface water treatment plants and is expected to be promulgated by november however  because it is impossible to predict the version of the eswtr that will be promulgated  registrant is unable to predict what additional costs  if any  will be incurred to comply with the eswtr 
regulation of disinfection disinfection by products registrant is also subject to the new regulations concerning disinfection disinfection by products dbp s  stage i of which regulations were effective in november  with full compliance required by stage i requires reduction of tri halomethane contaminants from micrograms per liter to micrograms per liter 
two of scw s systems are immediately impacted by this rule 
scw implemented modifications to the treatment process in its bay point and cordova systems 
it is anticipated that both systems will be in full compliance by the epa must adopt stage ii rules pertaining to dbps  according to a negotiated schedule by the epa is not allowed to use the new cost benefit analysis provided for in the sdwa amendments for establishing the stage ii rules applicable to dbps but may utilize the regulatory negotiating process provided for in the sdwa amendments to develop the stage ii rule 
the final rule is expected by ground water rule by spring  the epa is scheduled to propose regulations requiring disinfection of certain groundwater systems and provide guidance on determining which systems must provide disinfection facilities 
the epa may utilize the cost benefit analysis provided in the sdwa amendments to establish such regulations 
it is anticipated that the regulations will apply to several of scw s systems using groundwater supplies 
while no assurance can be given as to the nature and cost of any additional compliance measures  if any  registrant does not believe that such regulations will impose significant compliance costs  since scw already currently engages in disinfection of its groundwater systems 
regulation of radon and arsenic registrant expects to be subject to new regulations regarding radon and arsenic 
it is anticipated that the epa will propose a reduction in the federal standard on arsenic from parts per billion ppb to ppb 
this proposed arsenic rule is expected to be released in march or april of  with a day comment period 
it is anticipated that epa will propose ppb as the lead regulatory option  but will take comments on ppb and ppb options as well 
compliance with an mcl of ppb will require registrant to implement costly well head treatment remedies such as ion exchange or  alternatively  to purchase additional and more expensive water supplies already in compliance  for blending with well sources 
the epa has proposed new radon regulations following a national academy of sciences risk assessment and study of risk reduction benefits associated with various mitigation measures 
the national academy of sciences study is in agreement with much of epa s original findings but has slightly reduced the ingestion risk initially assumed by epa 
epa established an mcl of picocuries per liter based on the findings and has also established an alternative mcl of picocuries per liter  based upon potential mitigation measures for overall radon reduction 
the final rule will be effective in august  the registrant is currently conducting studies to determine the best treatment for affected wells 
voluntary efforts to exceed surface water treatment standards scw is a voluntary member of the epa s partnership for safe water  a national program designed to further protect the public from diseases caused by cryptosporidium and other microscopic organisms 
as a volunteer in the program  scw commits to exceed current regulations governing surface water treatment to ensure that its surface treatment facilities are performing as efficiently as possible 
fluoridation of water supplies registrant is subject to state of california assembly bill which requires fluoridation of water supplies for public water systems serving more than  service connections 
although the bill requires affected systems to install treatment facilities only when public funds have been made available to cover capital and operating costs  the bill requires the cpuc to authorize cost recovery through rates should public funds for operation of the facilities  once installed  become unavailable in future years 
matters relating to arden cordova system in january   scw was notified that ammonium perchlorate in amounts above the state determined action level had been detected in three of its wells serving its arden cordova system 
aerojet general corp 
has  in the past  used ammonium perchlorate in their processing as an oxidizer of rocket fuels 
scw took the three wells detected with ammonium perchlorate out of service at that time 
although neither the epa nor the dohs has established a drinking water standard for ammonium perchlorate  dohs has established an action level of parts per billion ppb which required scw to notify customers in its arden cordova customer service area of detection of ammonium perchlorate in amounts in excess of this action level 
in april   scw found ammonium perchlorate in three additional wells and  at that time  removed those wells from service until it was determined that the levels were below the state determined action level 
those wells were returned to service 
scw periodically monitors these wells to determine that levels of perchlorate are below the action level currently in effect 
in february  scw was informed that nitrosodimethylamine ndma had been detected in amounts in excess of the epa reference dosage for health risks in four of its wells in its arden cordova system 
each of the wells has been removed from service 
another well was also been removed from service in end of september  due to the contamination 
ndma is an additional by product from the production of rocket fuel and it is believed that such contamination is related to the activities of aerojet general corp 
aerojet general corp 
has reimbursed scw for constructing a pipeline to interconnect with the city of folsom water system to provide an alternative source s of water supply in scw s arden cordova customer service area and has reimbursed scw for costs associated with the drilling and equipping of two new wells 
scw and aerojet general corp 
are in negotiations on other matters related to procedures to address cleanup of the contaminated wells  costs associated with the cleanup  increased costs of purchased water as compared to pumped sources and costs associated with developing new sources of groundwater supply 
scw and aerojet general corp 
are attempting to negotiate an agreement on these matters 
as of december   aerojet general corp has reimbursed registrant million 
the remainder of the costs is subject to further reimbursement  including interest 
the reimbursement from aerojet general corp 
reduces scw s utility plant and costs of purchased water 
on october   scw filed a lawsuit against the california regional water quality control board crwqcb alleging that the crwqcb has willfully allowed portions of the sacramento county groundwater basin to be injected with chemical pollution that is destroying the underground water supply in scw s rancho cordova customer service area 
in a separate case  also filed on october   scw sued aerojet general corp 
for causing the contamination 
registrant is unable to predict what actions  if any  the crwqcb or aerojet general corp 
will take in response to the lawsuits 
matters relating to culver city system the compound  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  has been detected in the charnock basin  located in the city of santa monica and within scw s culver city customer service area 
mtbe is an oxygenate used in reformulated fuels 
at the request of the regional water quality control board  the city of santa monica and the california environmental protection agency  scw removed two of its wells in the culver city system from service in october  to help in efforts to avoid further spread of the mtbe contamination plume 
neither of these wells has been found to be contaminated with mtbe 
scw is purchasing water from the mwd at an increased cost to replace the water supply formerly pumped from the two wells removed from service 
on september   the us epa and the los angeles regional water quality control board ordered shell oil company  shell oil products company and equilon enterprises llc to provide replacement drinking water to both scw and the city of santa monica due to mtbe contamination of the charnock sub basin drinking water 
the agencies are continuing to investigate the causes of mtbe pollution and intend to ensure that all responsible parties contribute to its clean up 
registrant is unable to predict the outcome of the epa s enforcement efforts 
pursuant to an agreement with scw in december   two of the potentially responsible parties the participants have reimbursed scw s legal and consulting costs related to this matter and for increased costs incurred by scw in purchasing replacement water 
however  a notice of termination from the participants to the settlement agreement and a conditional termination from one of the responsible parties was received in october  scw and such parties are currently in the process of negotiation 
no assurances can be given that current or future negotiations will result in complete restoration of scw s water rights or that continued reimbursement of scw s costs will be forthcoming 
bear valley electric scw has been  in conjunction with the southern california edison unit of edison international  planning to upgrade transmission facilities to kv the kv project in order to meet increased energy and demand requirements 
the kv project is subject to an environmental impact report eir and delays in approval of the eir may impact service in scw s bear valley electric service customer service area 
scw has  however  taken other measures  including some measures that will be enacted on an emergency basis  to meet load growth and mitigate delays in approval of the eir 
water supply during  registrant supplied a total of  acre feet of water 
of this amount  approximately came from pumped sources and was purchased from others  principally the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd 
the remaining amount was supplied by the bureau of reclamation the bureau under a no cost contract 
during  registrant supplied  acre feet of water  of which came from pumped sources  was purchased and the remainder was supplied by the bureau 
the mwd is a water district organized under the laws of the state of california for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas within its jurisdiction 
registrant has connections to the water distribution facilities of mwd and other municipal water agencies 
mwd imports water from two principal sources the colorado river and the state water project swp 
available water supplies from the colorado river and the swp have historically been sufficient to meet most of mwd s requirements and mwd s supplies from these sources are anticipated to remain adequate through mwd s import of water from the colorado river is expected to decrease in future years due to the requirements of the central arizona project 
in response  mwd has taken a number of steps to secure additional storage capacity and to increase available water supplies  by effecting transfers of water rights from other sources 
registrant s water supply and revenues are significantly affected by changes in meteorological conditions 
new research data released in january show the pacific ocean may be undergoing a dramatic climate shift  known as the pacific decadal oscillation  that could alter global weather patterns and perhaps lead southern california into decades of drier than normal weather 
the changes signal that the pacific is shifting to a cool phase could last for decades  bring far more rain than usual to the pacific northwest and less to southland 
water sales volumes have been impacted during the last two years by the el nino la nina southern oscillation phenomena 
el nino brings substantial rainfall to southern california and the opposite  la nina  often means diminished rainfall 
during the s and s  el nino increased precipitation as much as of normal for some southern california water company service areas  while la nina conditions decreased rain levels to of normal 
in  after the el nino heavy rain season  la nina moved rainfall to the north and substantially reduced rainfall in scw s service areas with some systems experiencing less than of normal rainfall 
in spite of the anticipated la nina conditions  the water year supply outlook remains adequate 
as of january  california reservoirs stood at of average 
this positive outlook is due to the fact that reservoirs are still holding some of the el nino surplus and groundwater levels are usually not diminished by a single year of below normal precipitation 
although overall groundwater conditions remain at adequate levels  certain of scw s groundwater supplies have been affected to varying degrees by various forms of contamination which  in some cases  have caused increased reliance on purchased water in its supply mix 
business segments awr currently has two principal business units water service and electric distribution utility operations conducted through its scw subsidiary  and its non regulated activities through its asus subsidiary 
all activities of registrant currently are geographically located within the state of california  except for one contract for providing customer service and billing services to a utility located in the state of arizona 
scw is a regulated utility which operates both water and electric systems 
on a stand alone basis  awr has no material assets other than its investments in its subsidiaries 
see note to the notes to financial statements 
acquisition of chaparral city water company on march   registrant entered into an agreement to acquire the common stock of chaparral city water company  a privately operated water company serving approximately  customers in the town of fountain hills  arizona and portions of scottsdale  arizona for an aggregate value of million  including assumption of approximately million in debt 
chaparral city water company was purchased from mco properties inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of maxxam inc this marks the first acquisition outside of california for registrant 
the sale of chaparral city water company requires notification to the arizona corporation commission and other conditions customary in transactions of this type 
the approval of registrant s shareholders is not required 
it is anticipated that the transaction will close within one year 
year issue registrant has no yk incidents  business disruptions  failures or legal proceedings to report 
there were no actual or anticipated effects or changes to registrant s operating trends or revenue patterns as a result of the transition from december  to january  scw formally announced its yk ready status when it filed its compliance report with the cpuc on november  registrant s general process for addressing the yk issue was i to inventory all systems that may have a potential yk impact  ii to determine the materiality of these non yk ready systems  iii to replace and test  correct and test  or prepare for the failure of material items that have been determined to be non yk ready  and iv to prepare contingency plans  which included  among other things  increased staffing during critical periods  manual back up for automated systems and the use of portable generators capable of providing power during a black out 
not all yk problems were necessarily expected to surface in early registrant does not have  and may never fully have  sufficient information about the yk exposure of third parties to adequately predict the risks posed by them to registrant 
if the third parties later discover any yk problems that are not remedied  resulting problems could include loss of utility services and disruption of water supplies 
costs incurred to address yk issues are estimated to be million 
registrant has incurred million in costs associated with yk readiness at end of january  million of which is in capital investments 
on march   registrant filed an advice letter with the cpuc for recovery of yk related costs 
registrant believes that generally these capital expenditures as well as the remaining yk related investments will be recovered through rates  but can give no assurance that the cpuc will authorize recovery of all or some of these costs

litigation scw has recently been sued in eleven water quality related lawsuits a suit filed on april  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a federal superfund site a suit filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water  few of our systems are located in the geographical area covered by this suit a suit filed on december  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed in march  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on june  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site two suits filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on december  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed in july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site on september   the first district court of appeal in san francisco  held that the cpuc had preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities and ordered dismissal of a series of lawsuits against water utilities  including seven of the lawsuits against scw 
on october  one group of plaintiffs appealed the decision to the california supreme court which has accepted the petition 
management can not predict the outcome of the proceeding 
in march  the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation the oii as a result of these types of suits being filed against water utilities in california 
the cpuc is seeking to determine whether existing standards and policies regarding drinking water quality adequately protect the public health whether water utilities are following existing standards the administrative law judge assigned to the oii has issued a draft decision finding that water utilities  including scw  have complied with dohs regulation and requirements 
scw is unable to predict whether the draft decision will be approved in part or in its entirety 
the cpuc has authorized a memorandum account for legal expenses incurred by water utilities  including scw  in the water quality lawsuits 
under the memorandum account procedure  scw may recover litigation costs from ratepayers to the extent authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc has not yet authorized scw to recover any of its litigation costs 
as of december   registrant had incurred  in the oii related memorandum account 
environmental regulation scw is subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations that will result in increasing capital and operating costs 
these regulations include the amendments to the safe drinking water act that require increased testing and treatment of water to reduce specified contaminants to minimum containment levels interim regulations expected to be adopted before the end of requiring increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination  these regulations will affect scw s five surface water treatment plants additional regulation of disinfection disinfection byproducts expected to be adopted before the end of  these regulations will potentially affect two of scw s systems additional regulations expected to be adopted before the end of requiring disinfection of certain groundwater systems  these regulations will potentially impact several of scw s systems using groundwater supplies potential regulation of radon and arsenic new california requirements to fluoridate public water systems serving over  customers scw may be able to recover costs incurred to comply with these regulations through the ratemaking process for our regulated systems 
we may also be able to recover certain of these costs under our contractual arrangements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover costs from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination 
rates and regulation scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc 
awr and asus are not directly subject to cpuc regulation 
the cpuc may  however  regulate transactions between scw and awr  including the manner in which overhead costs are allocated between scw and awr and the pricing of services rendered by scw to awr 
scw s revenues depend substantially on the rates that it is permitted to charge its customers 
scw may increase rates in three ways by filing for a general rate increase by filing for recovery of certain expenses by filing an advice letter for certain plant additions  thereby increasing rate base in addition  scw recovers certain supply costs through a balancing account mechanism 
supply costs include the cost of purchased water and power and groundwater production assessments 
the balancing account mechanism is intended to insulate scw s earnings from changes in supply costs that are beyond scw s control 
the balancing account is not  however  designed to insulate scw s earnings against changes in supply mix 
as a result  scw may not recover increased costs due to increased use of purchased water through the balancing account mechanism 
in addition  balancing account adjustments  if authorized by the cpuc  may result in either increases or decreases in revenues attributable to supply costs incurred in prior periods  depending upon whether there has been an undercollection or overcollection of supply costs 
there are also a number of matters pending before the cpuc that may affect our future financial results 
these matters include applications filed by scw to increase rates in of its rate making jurisdictions  a final decision is not expected until second quarter of although a tentative settlement has been worked out an application filed to consolidate the rate making jurisdictions located in scw s region iii area into a single tariff the oii new guidelines under consideration by the cpuc for the acquisition and merger of water utilities and for privatization transactions adequacy of water supplies the adequacy of water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall the amount of water stored in reservoirs the amount used by our customers and others water quality  and legal limitations on use 
as a result of heavier than normal rainfall in the winter of  most of california s reservoirs remain at or near capacity and the outlook for water supply in the near term is generally favorable 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used have  however  increased limitations on use to prevent overdrafting of groundwater basins 
the import of water from the colorado river  one of our important sources of supply  is expected to decrease in future years due to the requirements of the central arizona project 
we also have in recent years taken wells out of service due to water quality problems 
water shortages could be caused by the above factors and may affect us in several ways they adversely affect supply mix by causing registrant to rely on more expensive purchased water they adversely affect operating costs they may result in an increase in capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supplies and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water we may be able to recover increased operating and construction costs for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process 
registrant may also be able to recover certain of these costs under the terms of our contractual agreements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover these costs from third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
we are currently negotiating with aerojet general corporation regarding costs associated with the cleanup of the groundwater supply for our arden cordova system and for the increased costs of purchasing water and developing new sources of groundwater supply 
we are also negotiating with two participants on matters relating to the clean up and purchase of replacement water in the charnock basin located in the cities of santa monica and culver city 
these two potentially responsible parties have previously reimbursed us for replacement water and certain legal and consulting expenses 
the charnock basin is in scw s service territory
