item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such a differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in risk factors in part i 
overview since its inception  avigen has devoted substantially all of its resources to research and development activities 
we are a development stage company and have not received any revenue from the sale of products  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of government grants and payments under collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
at june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
results of operations fiscal years ended june    and grant revenue was  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june   and no revenue for the year ended june  all grant revenue for these years consisted of reimbursements under a grant from the national institutes of health  which expired on march  at june   we were no longer party to any agreements that would provide for future reimbursement of research and development expenses  and do not expect to be party to any similar agreements for the foreseeable future 
our research and development expenses totaled million for the year ended june   an increase from million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the increase during fiscal over the previous year was primarily related to the increase in personnel and recruitment costs for additional scientific and manufacturing staff hired to support our product development efforts  including our clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia b that began in june the rise in research and development costs in fiscal also included over  in research fees paid to collaborators in connection with our clinical trial and other preclinical studies 
the increase in research and development expenses between june  and was primarily due to the write off of equipment 
we expect research and development spending to increase significantly over the next several years as we expand our research  product development and clinical trial efforts 
we incurred in license fees of million in fiscal  the first year in which these charges were significant  in connection with new agreements to in license certain patents that we use in our research and development efforts 
the full year expense included cash payments to licensors of approximately million and a non cash charge for warrants issued to a licensor that were valued at approximately million 
these expenses are primarily initiation fees  and are not predictive of initial in license fees to be incurred in future periods 
general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended june   up from million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  the increase during fiscal over the previous year was primarily related to higher compensation for executive management and new staff  as well as higher recruitment costs and in an increase in legal fees related to our patent and other intellectual property activities 
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended june  as compared with the year ended june  was also primarily due to increases in personnel costs and legal fees in connection with patent documentation 
in general  we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as the level of our activities increase  but general and administrative expenses should decrease as a percentage of total expenses as we expand our research and development efforts 
net interest income  for the year ended june  was million  up from  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the current year was directly related to the increase in cash and investments in marketable securities from the application of proceeds received from the private placement of common stock and warrants that was completed in november  and proceeds received from the public offering completed in april and may of net interest income declined from fiscal to fiscal as our usage of cash for operating expenses exceeded our receipt of cash from equity investments during the period 
liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenue since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities 
since our initial public offering in may  we have completed four private placements of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million  and completed a follow on public offering raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during the same period  as a result of exercises of warrants and options to purchase our common stock  we raised an additional million 
the timing and size of the exercise of these warrants and options are determined by the decisions of the respective warrant and option holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds raised in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be raised in any future periods 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant losses  as we continue and expand our research and development activities and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our gene therapy product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of approximately million compared to million at june  this increase was principally due to proceeds received during the year from the private placements  public offering  and the on going exercise of warrants and stock options 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space leased through may  with lease payments totaling  for fiscal and increasing each year to approximately million for fiscal in june  we increased to million a previously existing revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank to provide financial support for construction related activities 
under the terms of the increase  the line of credit is available through june  at june   we had borrowed million from the line of credit 
in may  we secured a capital lease facility under which  at june   we owed  and had no further availability 
we believe that our available resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for approximately two years 
however  there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before this time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals 
the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the costs of commercialization activities  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  when market conditions allow 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  there may be further dilution to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into these financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to material market risk 
we have also evaluated the risk associated with our wells capital management investments in marketable securities and have deemed this risk immaterial
