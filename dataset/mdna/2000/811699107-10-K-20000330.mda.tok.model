gross profit systems services the company has experienced significant variations in revenues  expenses and operating results from quarter to quarter and such variations are likely to continue 
a significant portion of the company s revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
the company has also experienced significant variations in its quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems so affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  the gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by the company and its competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors may materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of the company s expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the foregoing  the company believes that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds of the company s common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million from million at december  to million at december  working capital increased from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  the net cash provided by operating activities during was the result of the net income adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  inventory valuation allowance and the changes in certain assets and liabilities 
the significant net changes in assets and liabilities that provided cash in operations include an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in income taxes receivable  primarily resulting from a million federal income tax refund 
these items that provided cash from operations was offset by an increase in inventories  principally attributable to the increase in the number of product lines 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in the year ended december  investment activity consisted primarily of capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer equipment  office furniture  and other capital equipment required to support the expansion and growth of the business 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  in the year ended december  in  the cash provided by financing included million of borrowings under the equipment line of credit and million received in connection with the issuance of common stock pursuant to both the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
during the same period  cash used by financing activities included the repayment of million outstanding under the revolving line of credit and the equipment line of credit and  in principal payments under the company s capital lease obligations 
the company has a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment line of credit with a bank 
the revolving line of credit expired in october and was subsequently extended until march  the equipment line of credit expired in june and was subsequently extended until march  the company is in the process of renewing both lines of credit 
borrowings under the lines of credit are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
loans made under the revolving line of credit would generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate plus 
loans made under the equipment line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate plus at december  
the loan agreement relating to the lines of credit requires that the company provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including the maintenance of total liabilities  excluding deferred revenue  to net worth of at least 
to at december  the company was in compliance with all covenants 
as of december   there were no borrowings against the line of credit 
as of december   borrowings against the equipment line of credit were  maturities of the equipment line of credit are   and  in  and  respectively 
the company believes that existing funds together with available borrowings under the line of credit and equipment line facility are adequate to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments as of december  impact of year in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
effects of inflation management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
the company will adopt sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 deferral of the effective date of the fasb statement no 
 in fiscal year to date the company has not utilized derivative instruments or hedging activities and  therefore  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the application of the guidance in sab will be required in the company s second quarter of the fiscal year the effects of applying this guidance  if any  will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle 
the company s evaluation of sab is not yet complete 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  the company has not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at december   the company had  outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated short term debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by  the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
the company s cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which the company considers securities to be purchased with original maturities of three months or less given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures
