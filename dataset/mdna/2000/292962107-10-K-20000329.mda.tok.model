interest income 
interest income was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due primarily to the lower cash and cash equivalent balances 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company received net proceeds of approximately  from an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock and approximately  from a concurrent private placement to medtronic  inc of  shares of its common stock 
also on march   all outstanding shares of the company s preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock following the for reverse stock split

for the year ended december   the company used  for operations and  for capital expenditures 
in january  the company announced a financing agreement with medtronic  inc under the agreement  the company would receive million from medtronic asset management  which is repayable by or  if earlier  at the close of a significant round of debt or equity financing 
the company received million of the financing in february and the remaining million in january in july  the company received proceeds of  from a private placement of  share of its common stock to accredited investors 
the placement was priced at per share 
in august  these shares were registered pursuant to the securities act of the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  with the addition of the medtronic financing  will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company through at least the next months 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of regulatory actions regarding the company s products  the results of clinical trials and competition  the extent to which the company s ensite system gains market acceptance and the costs and timing of expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities 
year the company did not experience any material disruption as a result of year computer problems in its financial systems  internal manufacturing processes or the ensite system 
in addition  the company did not experience any material disruption due to the systems of other companies on which the company relies 
the amount of remediation work required to address year problems was not extensive and the total cost of resolving year issues did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had approximately million of cash and investments on december  substantially all of the investments were us government or investment grade  fixed income securities from domestic issuers 
because of the credit risk criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of the company s investments  however  because management considers it unlikely that the company would need or choose to substantially liquidate the company s investments  management believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
even though the company distributes products abroad  the company does not conduct sales in foreign currencies 
therefore  management does not believe the company is exposed to any material foreign currency exchange rate risk
