unauthorized trading losses in november  we discovered that a former employee of paa had engaged in unauthorized trading activity  resulting in losses of approximately million million  including estimated associated costs and legal expenses 
approximately million of the unauthorized trading loss was recognized in and the remainder in as a result  we have restated our financial information 
normally  as paa purchases crude oil  it establishes a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts 
the employee in question violated paa s policy of maintaining a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales or future delivery obligations 
the unauthorized trading and associated losses resulted in a default of certain covenants under paa s credit facilities and significant short term cash and letter of credit requirements 
see capital resources  liquidity and financial condition 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per share on total revenue of billion as compared to a net loss of million  or per share on total revenue of billion in for the year ended december   we reported net income of million or per share per share diluted  on total revenue of million 
the net losses for the years ended december  and include the following nonrecurring items 
million of unauthorized trading losses

net daily production from our onshore california properties increased to approximately  boe per day in  up  boe per day  or over and over excluding production from the mt

this is our most volatile area in terms of maintaining production levels 
net daily production in the illinois basin averaged  boe per day during   boe per day in and  boe per day in oil and natural gas revenues were million in  an increase of over due to higher prices and increased production volumes

gross margin from pipeline operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase resulted from twelve months of results from the all american pipeline in versus five months in  increased margins from our pipeline merchant activities  and to the acquisitions of scurlock and the west texas gathering system which contributed approximately million of pipeline gross margin 
the increase was partially offset by lower tariff transport volumes  due to lower production from exxon s santa ynez field and the point arguello field  both offshore california 
the margin between revenue and direct cost of crude purchased was million for the year ended december  compared to million in pipeline tariff revenues were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in pipeline operations and maintenance expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for tariff transport volumes on the all american pipeline decreased from an average of  barrels per day for the year ended december  to  barrels per day in due primarily to a decrease in shipments of offshore california production  which decreased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in barrels associated with our merchant activities on the all american pipeline increased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day for the year ended december  tariff volumes shipped on the scurlock and west texas gathering systems averaged  barrels per day during in march  we sold the segment of the all american pipeline that extends from emidio  california to mccamey  texas 
we initiated the sale of approximately million barrels of crude oil linefill from the all american pipeline in november the sale of the linefill was substantially complete in february we estimate that we will recognize a total gain of approximately million in connection with the sale of the linefill 
as of december   we had delivered approximately million barrels of linefill and recognized a gain of million

the following table sets forth from july   our date of acquisition  the all american pipeline average deliveries per day within and outside california in thousands year ended december  deliveries average daily volumes barrels within california outside california total gathering and marketing activities and terminalling and storage activities 
excluding the unauthorized trading losses  gross margin from terminalling and storage and gathering and marketing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   reflecting a increase over the million reported for and a increase over the million reported for the increase in gross margin is due to an increase in lease gathering and bulk purchase volumes  primarily as a result of the scurlock acquisition  which contributed approximately million of gross margin  and an increase in storage capacity leased at our cushing terminal 
lease gathering volumes increased from an average of  and  barrels per day in and  respectively  to approximately  barrels per day in bulk purchase volumes increased from approximately  and  barrels per day for and  respectively  to approximately  barrels per day this year 
leased terminal capacity increased significantly from approximately and million barrels per month in and  respectively  to million barrels per month during the million barrel expansion of our cushing terminal was placed in service in the second quarter of throughput volumes at our terminals increased approximately  and  barrels per day in the current year period from and  respectively 
in the period immediately following the disclosure of the unauthorized trading losses  a significant number of paa s suppliers and trading partners reduced or eliminated the open credit previously extended to paa 
consequently  the amount of letters of credit paa needed to support the level of crude oil purchases then in effect increased significantly 
in addition  the cost to paa of obtaining letters of credit increased under the amended credit facility 
in many instances paa arranged for letters of credit to secure its obligations to purchase crude oil from its customers  which increased its letter of credit costs and decreased its unit margins 
in other instances  primarily involving lower margin wellhead and bulk purchases  certain of paa s purchase contracts were terminated 
as a result of these changes  aggregate volumes purchased are expected to decrease by  barrels per day  consisting primarily of lower unit margin purchases 
approximately  barrels per day of the decrease is related to barrels gathered at producer lease locations and  barrels per day is attributable to bulk purchases 
as a result of the increase in letter of credit costs and reduced volumes  annual ebitda is expected to be adversely affected by approximately million  excluding the positive impact of current favorable market conditions 
midstream general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for and  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions in  the all american pipeline acquisition in  continued expansion of our midstream business activities and expenses related to the operation of plains all american pipeline as a public entity 
as a result of the unauthorized trading losses  we will incur increased expenses in  primarily accounting and consulting related 
midstream depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in is due primarily to the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions in and the all american pipeline acquisition in july the increase in is due to the all american pipeline acquisition 
general primarily as a result of aforementioned acquisitions and increased production levels  total depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  for increased to million as compared to million in and million in the increase in is due to interest associated with the debt incurred for the scurlock and west texas gathering system acquisitions  interest for a full year on debt outstanding from the all american pipeline acquisition  an increase in interest related to hedged inventory transactions and higher debt levels related to our acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration activities 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily associated with the debt incurred for the acquisition of the all american pipeline and the sjv gathering system and our upstream acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration activities 
the extraordinary item of million net of tax and minority interest in relates to the write off of certain debt issue costs and penalties associated with the prepayment of debt 
during  and  we capitalized million  million and million of interest  respectively 
in  we recognized a pre tax gain of million in connection with paa s october public offering 
the gain is the result of an increase in the book value of our equity in paa to reflect our proportionate share of the underlying net assets of paa due to the sale of the units 
during  we recognized a pre tax gain of million net of approximately million in formation related expenses in connection with the formation of paa as a result of an increase in the book value of our equity as previously discussed 
the formation related expenses consist primarily of amounts due to certain key employees in connection with the successful formation of paa and debt prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   we recognized a net deferred tax benefit of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a deferred tax benefit of million and a current tax provision of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a deferred federal tax provision of million and a current tax provision of million 
at december   we have a net deferred tax asset of million 
management believes that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income sufficient to realize such asset based on certain tax planning strategies available 
during  we incurred a charge of million related to noncash incentive compensation paid to certain officers and key employees of plains all american inc  the general partner of paa 
in  plains all american inc 
granted the employees the right to earn ownership in common units of paa owned by plains all american inc the units vest over a three year period subject to paa paying distributions on their common and subordinated units 
in addition  a million restructuring charge  primarily associated with severance related expenses  was also incurred by paa 
as a result of the restructuring  paa expects to reduce costs by approximately million per year 
capital resources  liquidity and financial condition unauthorized trading losses in november  we discovered that a former employee of paa had engaged in unauthorized trading activity  resulting in losses of approximately million million  including estimated associated costs and legal expenses 
a full investigation into the unauthorized trading activities by outside legal counsel and independent accountants and consultants determined that the vast majority of the losses occurred primarily from march through november  and the impact warranted a restatement of previously reported financial information for and because the financial statements of paa are consolidated with our financial statements  adverse effects on the financial statements of paa directly affect our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we have restated our previously reported and results to reflect the losses incurred from these unauthorized trading activities see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
normally  as paa purchases crude oil  it establishes a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users or by entering into a future delivery obligation with respect to futures contracts 
the trader in question violated paa s policy of maintaining a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales or future delivery obligations 
the unauthorized trading and associated losses resulted in a default of certain covenants under paa s credit facilities and significant short term cash and letter of credit requirements 
although one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of and owns of paa  the trading losses do not affect the operations or assets of our upstream business 
the debt of paa is nonrecourse to us

our million credit facility is collateralized by our crude oil and natural gas properties 
in december  paa executed amended credit facilities and obtained default waivers from all of its lenders 
the amended credit facilities 
waived defaults under covenants contained in the existing credit facilities  
increased availability under paa s letter of credit and borrowing facility from million in november to million in december  million in january  and thereafter decreasing to million in february through april  to million in may and june and to million in july through july  
required the lenders consent prior to the payment of distributions to unitholders  
prohibited contango inventory transactions subsequent to january   and 
increased interest rates and fees under certain of the facilities 
paa paid approximately million to its lenders in connection with the amended credit facilities 
this amount was capitalized as debt issue costs and will be amortized over the remaining term of the amended facilities 
in connection with the amendments  we loaned approximately million to paa 
this subordinated debt is due not later than november  we financed the million that we loaned paa with 
the issuance of a new series of our convertible preferred stock for proceeds of million  
cash distributions of approximately million made to paa s general partner in november  and 
million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have taken appropriate and aggressive steps within our organization to enhance our processes and procedures to prevent future unauthorized trading 
one of such steps includes the creation of a new professional risk management position 
this risk manager has direct responsibility and authority for our trading controls and procedures and other aspects of corporate risk management 
however  we can give no assurance that such steps will detect and prevent all violations of our trading policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved

cash provided by financing activities in was generated primarily from net issuances of million in preferred stock million in common units and million of short term and long term debt 
cash inflows from financing activities during included net issuances of of short term and long term debt  million of common units in connection with paa s initial public offering and million in preferred stock 
working capital at december   we had working capital of approximately million 
working capital at december  includes million of pipeline linefill and million for the segment of the all american pipeline that were both sold in the first quarter of proceeds from the linefill sale were used to fund the portion of the unauthorized trading losses that were settled in cash during the first quarter of proceeds from the sale of the pipeline were used to reduce paa s outstanding debt under its bank credit agreement 
we had a working capital deficit of approximately million at december  we have historically operated with a working capital deficit due primarily to ongoing capital expenditures that have been financed through cash flow and our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures we have made and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations  bank borrowings and the sale of subordinated notes  common stock and preferred stock 
we intend to make aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million in  including approximately million on the development and exploitation of our upstream properties  and approximately million for midstream activities 
in addition  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of underdeveloped producing properties 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash from operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund our upstream capital expenditures 
the midstream capital expenditures are expected to be funded by paa through working capital  cash flow and draws under paa s revolving credit facility under its bank credit agreement 
changing crude oil and natural gas prices our upstream activities are affected by changes in crude oil prices which have historically been volatile 
the benchmark nymex crude oil price of per barrel at december  was more that double the per barrel price at year end although we have routinely hedged a substantial portion of our crude oil production and intend to continue this practice  substantial future crude oil price declines would adversely affect our overall results  and therefore our liquidity 
furthermore  low crude oil prices could affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms 
decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas have had  and could have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
almost all of our reserve base approximately of year end reserve volumes is comprised of long life oil properties that are sensitive to crude oil price volatility 
in order to manage our exposure to commodity price risk  we have routinely hedged a portion of our crude oil production 
for  we have entered into various arrangements which provide for us to receive an average minimum nymex wti price of per barrel on  barrels of oil per day 
thus  based on our average fourth quarter crude oil production rate  these arrangements generally provide us with downside price protection for approximately of our production 
approximately  barrels per day of the volumes hedged in will participate in price increases above the per barrel floor price  subject to a ceiling limitation of per barrel 
for  we have entered into arrangements under which we will receive an average minimum nymex wti price of approximately per barrel on  barrels per day 
the hedges participate in price increases and are not subject to a ceiling limitation 
all of our nymex crude oil prices are before quality and location differentials 
management intends to continue to maintain hedging arrangements for a significant portion of our production 
such contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
see item business product markets and major customers and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
as is common with most merchant activities  our ability to generate a profit on our midstream margin activities is not tied to the absolute level of crude oil prices but is generated by the difference between the price paid and other costs incurred in the purchase of crude oil and the price at which we sell crude oil 
the gross margin generated by tariff activities depends on the volumes transported on the pipeline and the level of the tariff charged  as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the pipeline 
these operations are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for crude oil 
commitments although we obtained environmental studies on our properties in california  the sunniland trend and illinois basin  and we believe that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for approximately years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
we have estimated that the costs to perform these tasks is approximately million  net of salvage value and other considerations 
such estimated costs are amortized to expense through the unit of production method as a component of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization 
results from operations for  and include million  million and million  respectively  of expense associated with these estimated future costs 
for valuation and realization purposes of the affected crude oil and natural gas properties  these estimated future costs are also deducted from estimated future gross revenues to arrive at the estimated future net revenues and the standardized measure disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contingencies since our announcement in november of paa s losses resulting from unauthorized trading by a former employee  numerous class action lawsuits have been filed against paa  certain of its general partner s officers and directors and in some of these cases  its general partner and us alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
in addition  derivative lawsuits were filed in the delaware chancery court against paa s general partner  its directors and certain of its officers alleging the defendants breached the fiduciary duties owed to paa and its unitholders by failing to monitor properly the activities of its traders 
see item legal proceedings 
we may experience future releases of crude oil into the environment from our pipeline and storage operations  or discover releases that were previously unidentified 
while we maintain an extensive inspection program designed to prevent and  as applicable  to detect and address such releases promptly  damages and liabilities incurred due to any future environmental releases from our assets may substantially affect our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we are hedging changes in an asset s  liability s  or firm commitment s fair value  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
for cash flow hedge transactions  in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable rate asset  liability  or a forecasted transaction  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in other comprehensive income 
the gains and losses on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive income will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
this statement was amended by statement of financial accounting standards no

year year project 
in order to address the year issue  we initiated a year project 
we incurred approximately million through december   in connection with our year project  approximately million of which were costs paid to third parties 
we did not encounter any critical system application  hardware or equipment failures during the date roll over to the year  and have not experienced any disruptions of business activities as a result of year failures by our customers  suppliers  service providers or business partners 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in crude oil commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage our exposure  we monitor our inventory levels  current economic conditions and our expectations of future commodity prices and interest rates when making decisions with respect to risk management 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
substantially all of our derivative contracts are exchanged or traded with major financial institutions and the risk of credit loss is considered remote 
commodity price risk 
the fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a percent adverse price change are shown in the table below in millions december  adverse adverse fair price fair price value change value change crude oil futures contracts swaps and options contracts the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the swap and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year end 
all hedge positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market  none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board percent adverse change in prices regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual percent change in prompt month crude oil prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
interest rate risk 
our debt instruments are sensitive to market fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below presents principal payments and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt outstanding at december  our variable rate debt bears interest at libor plus the applicable margin 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  the carrying value of variable rate bank debt approximates fair value as interest rates are variable  based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of fixed rate debt was based on quoted market prices based on trades of subordinated debt 
the fair value of the redeemable preferred stock approximates its liquidation value at december  expected year of maturity fair thereafter total value dollars in millions liabilities short term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt variable rate average interest rate long term debt fixed rate average interest rate redeemable preferred stock at december   the carrying value of all variable rate bank debt and the redeemable preferred stock of million and million  respectively  approximated the fair value and liquidation value  respectively  at that date 
the carrying value and fair value of the fixed rate debt was million and million  respectively  at that date 
interest rate swaps and collars are used to hedge underlying debt obligations 
these instruments hedge specific debt issuances and qualify for hedge accounting 
the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the instruments 
at december   we had interest rate swap and collar arrangements for an aggregate notional principal amount of million  which positions had an aggregate value of approximately million as of such date 
these instruments are based on libor margins and generally provide for a floor of and a ceiling of for million of debt and a floor of and a ceiling of for million of debt 
in august  we terminated our swap arrangements on an aggregate notional principal amount of million and we received consideration in the amount of approximately million 
at december   we had interest rate swap arrangements for an aggregate notional principal amount of million and would have been required to pay approximately million to terminate the instruments at that date
