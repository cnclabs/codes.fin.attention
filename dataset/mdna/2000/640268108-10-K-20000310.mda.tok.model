item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
inhale s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview since its inception in july  inhale has been engaged in the development of a pulmonary system for the delivery of macromolecules and other drugs for systemic and local lung applications 
inhale has been unprofitable since inception and expects to incur significant and increasing additional operating losses over the next several years primarily due to increasing research and development expenditures and expansion of late stage clinical and early stage commercial manufacturing facilities 
to date  inhale has not sold any commercial products and does not anticipate receiving revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   inhale incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
inhale s sources of working capital have been partner fundings  including milestone payments  from short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts  equity financings  financings of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  and interest earned on investments of cash 
inhale has generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements generally pay for some or all research and development expenses and make additional payments to inhale as inhale achieves certain key milestones 
inhale expects to receive royalties from its partners based on their revenues received from product sales  and to receive revenue from the manufacturing of powders and the supply of devices 
in certain cases  inhale may enter into collaborative agreements under which inhale s partners would manufacture or package powders or supply inhalation devices  thereby potentially limiting one or more sources of revenue for inhale 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  inhale  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products utilizing its pulmonary drug delivery system 
there can be no assurance that inhale can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
in late  inhale completed the sale of approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due october  in early  the company entered into agreements with certain holders of these outstanding debentures to convert their debentures into common stock in exchange for a cash payment 
to date  the company has agreed to make cash payments of approximately million in the aggregate in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debentures into approximately million shares of common stock 
such amounts will be reflected as a charge to interest expense in the first quarter of in february   inhale received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures to certain qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
interest on the debentures will accrue at a rate of per year  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the debentures will mature in and are convertible into shares of inhale s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
results of operations years ended december   and contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
costs of contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expense 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to expansion of inhale s existing collaborative agreement with pfizer  and includes activities associated with the manufacture of phase iii clinical supplies 
pfizer represented approximately of inhale s revenues for the year ended december  revenue for and included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of up front signing and progress payments received from inhale s collaborative partners 
recognition of up front signing and progress payments is based on actual efforts expended 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses represent proprietary research expenses as well as the costs related to contract research revenue and include the salaries and benefits of scientific and development personnel  clinical manufacturing costs  laboratory supplies  consulting services  facilities  costs of obtaining intellectual property protection for inhale s technologies and expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes 
the increase in such expenses in from was due to increased spending related to the scale up of technologies and the continuing development of global manufacturing capabilities in order to support phase iii inhaleable insulin clinical trials and commercial production 
in addition  the company hired additional scientific and development personnel to handle an increase in the number of development projects and incurred increased expenses associated with device development and clinical manufacturing 
the largest components of the increase in research and development were the increases of million in salaries and employee benefits expense  a million increase in research and development supplies and services  and a million increase in facilities and administrative expense allocations associated with supporting the research and development efforts 
the million increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily attributable to the development of infrastructure necessary to manufacture the company s products on a late stage clinical scale 
inhale expects research and development spending to increase over the next few years as inhale expands its development efforts under collaborative agreements and scales up its commercial manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in from is attributed to an increased percentage of general and administrative related costs allocated to research and development operations 
the million increase in such expenses in was due primarily to costs associated with supporting inhale s increased research efforts including administrative staffing  business development activities and marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next few years as inhale expands its operations 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in from and the increase in interest income in from were primarily due to inhale maintaining larger cash and investment balances  including the proceeds of its october  issuance of convertible subordinated debentures which resulted in net proceeds of million 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in from primarily relates to interest on the above mentioned convertible subordinated debentures 
the million increase in interest expense in from related to increased debt balances  including the proceeds of the company s november  tenant improvement loan 
at december   inhale had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
acquired in process research and development on november   inhale concluded an agreement with alliance pharmaceutical corp 
to acquire alliance s pulmospheres registered trademark particle and particle processing technology for use in respiratory drug delivery 
under the terms of the agreement  inhale received the rights to pulmospheres registered trademark technology  other related assets including research materials  laboratory records  and certain equipment that had been used in the development of pulmospheres technology and the manufacturing and testing of particles using such pulmospheres technology  and alliance stock valued at million in exchange for million in cash and million of inhale stock 
alliance also has the right to additional substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on a defined number of products commercialized using the technology 
million of the purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and has been charged as an expense in the year ended december  the pulmospheres registered trademark technology utilizes an emulsification process to produce a powder having characteristics that inhale believes may improve efficiency and reproducibility for drugs delivered to the lung through alternative technologies such as metered dose inhalers mdi s  as well as potentially improve drug delivery through inhale s proprietary deep lung drug delivery system 
inhale evaluates this technology to be in the pre clinical stage of development 
the purchased research and development had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
it was identified and valued through extensive interviews and discussions with appropriate management and scientific personnel and the analysis of data provided by alliance regarding the pulmospheres registered trademark technology  its stage of development at the time of acquisition  the importance of the technology to inhale s overall development plan  and the projected incremental cash flows from the projects when completed and any associated risks 
associated risks include the uncertainties in overcoming significant technological risks  acquiring fda approval and establishing commercial viability 
inhale does not expect the products which utilize the pulmospheres registered trademark technology to obtain fda approval before inhale is in process of evaluating which projects will benefit the most from the pulmospheres registered trademark technology and is estimating the associated future development costs  which are expected to be substantial through liquidity and capital resources inhale has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of its equity securities  convertible debentures  contract research revenues  interest income earned on its investments of cash and financing of equipment acquisitions 
in its initial public offering completed may  inhale raised net proceeds of approximately million and raised additional net proceeds of million in its public offering completed in march in february  inhale completed a private placement of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in november  inhale completed a public offering of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
inhale secured a million loan in november to finance the purchases of equipment and facility improvements 
in december  inhale completed a private placement of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in october  the company received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures 
at december   inhale had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
in february  inhale completed the sale of convertible subordinated notes netting proceeds of approximately million 
this includes cash payments of approximately million in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million of its october debentures that were outstanding at december  inhale s operations used cash of million and million  and provided cash of million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from inhale s net operating losses in these periods principally due to increased depreciation expense and fluctuations in the company s accounts receivable  other assets  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue balances 
fluctuations in these balances reflect inhale s increased research  development and manufacturing activities  as well as timing differences in the receipt of cash from inhale s development partners 
additionally  in  inhale  recorded a million write off of acquired research and development in connection with the acquisition of pulmospheres registered trademark technology 
inhale purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in is primarily due to the increased expenditures in for the purchase of land and the build out of inhale s manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters located in san carlos  california 
the company also invested million in the purchase of pulmospheres registered trademark technology in  in addition to its non cash exchange of common stock for shares of alliance valued at million 
inhale expects its cash requirements to continue at an accelerated rate due to expected increases in costs associated with further research and development of its technologies  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  purchases of capital equipment  investments in technologies  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion  including the completion of inhale s commercial manufacturing facility and scale up of device manufacturing with its outside contract manufacturers 
given its current cash requirements  the company believes that it will have sufficient cash to meet its operating expense requirements for at least the next months 
however  the company plans to continue to invest heavily in its growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
inhale s capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its research and development arrangements  progress with pre clinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scale up of inhale s powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of its late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy its long term needs  inhale intends to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to inhale on favorable terms  if at all 
inhale is currently considering expansion opportunities which would likely involve the sale and leaseback of land adjacent to its current facilities and the development of new facilities on such land 
inhale anticipates that its lease obligations relating to this proposal would be approximately million over the term of the lease  which inhale expects to extend approximately years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of inhale s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  inhale invests in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
inhale s investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  inhale invests in short term securities and maintains an average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease less than in the fair value of inhale s available for sale securities 
the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on inhale s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate  decrease less than in the fair value of inhale s available for sale securities at december  increases in interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of inhale s convertible subordinated debentures  which pay a fixed rate of interest
