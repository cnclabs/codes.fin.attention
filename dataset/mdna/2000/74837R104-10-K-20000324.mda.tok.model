the capital program was financed from operations  additional borrowings and from the sale of the company s common stock 
cash flow the company believes that its capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of its business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and gas prices  and there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
the company s principal operating sources of cash include sales of natural gas and crude oil and revenues from transportation and processing 
the company sells approximately of its natural gas production under long term contracts 
as a result  the company benefits from significant predictability of its natural gas revenues 
commodity market prices affect cash flow for that portion of natural gas not under contract as well as most of the company s crude oil sales 
the company s net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period last year 
the reduction resulted from lower earnings  a million account receivable not collected  and other working capital uses of cash 
the company s net cash used in investing for the year ended december  was million  including million for the unocal property acquisition  million for the share of beaver creek pipeline and million for mgv energy see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other investing activities comprised development of oil and gas properties 
the company s activities have been financed through a combination of operating cash flow and bank borrowings  and the sale of additional common stock 
the company s net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
borrowings increased a net million  and the company received million net from the sale of  shares in a public offering in the fourth quarter credit facilities as part of the merger with msr on march   the company entered into a new five year credit facility 
the existing debt of million and million from msr was transferred into the new credit facility 
the credit facility permits the company to obtain revolving credit loans and to issue letters of credit for the company s account from time to time in a total amount not to exceed the lesser of million or the borrowing base 
as of december   the borrowing base was million and it is subject to semi annual determination and other redeterminations based upon a variety of factors  including the pv value of reserves 
as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
at the company s option  loans may be prepaid  and revolving credit commitments may be reduced  in whole or in part at any time in specified minimum amounts 
the company can designate the interest rate on amounts outstanding at either the london interbank offered rate libor or at bank prime 
the collateral for this loan agreement consists of substantially all existing assets and any future reserves acquired 
the loan agreement contains a number of dividend restrictions and restrictive covenants  which  among other things  require the maintenance of a minimum current ratio 
the company intends to refinance the us  of debt related to mgv energy inc in market risk the company sells approximately of its natural gas under long term  fixed price contracts  and swap agreements and therefore  benefits from significant predictability of its natural gas revenues 
commodity market price fluctuations affect natural gas volumes that are not sold under contract  and also affect crude oil sales that are not hedged 
in addition  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements covering million in debt 
these agreements consist of one covering million through may   which converts the debt floating libor base rate to a fixed rate  and a second for million through june   which converts the debt floating libor base rate to a fixed rate 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  higher as a result of these rate swaps 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues and the value of its oil and gas properties have been and will be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company s ability to maintain current borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms is also substantially dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of crude oil and per mcf of natural gas 
although the level of inflation affects certain of the company s costs and expenses  inflation did not have a significant effect in should conditions in the industry improve  inflationary cost pressures may resume 
results of operations quicksilver s revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  which are dependent upon numerous factors  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the energy markets have historically been highly volatile  and future decreases in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on quicksilver s financial position  results of operations  quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced  and access to capital

as a result of the merger  msr ceased to exist  and all of its assets and liabilities were transferred to the company
