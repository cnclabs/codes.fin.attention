item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year of the three year period ended december  our financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
general we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development and operation of oil and gas properties onshore and in shallow waters offshore louisiana 
we have been active in the gulf coast basin since  which gives us extensive geophysical  technical and operational expertise in this area 
our business strategy is to increase production  cash flow and reserves through the acquisition and development of mature properties located in the gulf coast basin 
operating environment our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
beginning in late and continuing throughout and the first quarter of  the oil and gas industry experienced a trend of declines in natural gas and crude oil prices 
the decline in natural gas prices was attributable to milder than normal weather conditions resulting in excess domestic supplies  while oil prices declined because of higher world supplies coupled with an anticipated decrease in demand resulting from the overall outlook of the global economy 
as a result of the worldwide decline in the supply of crude oil caused by opec s self imposed oil production reductions  since the first quarter of  the price for crude oil has improved significantly 
in addition  the price for natural gas has increased from the first quarter of because of the market s perception of lower than normal supplies combined with the expected increase in future demand 
the average prices we received for our production during the fourth quarter of totaled per barrel and per mcf  as compared to average prices received during the fourth quarter of of per barrel and per mcf 
all unit pricing amounts include the effects of hedging 
the demand for and the costs of drilling rigs and related products and services fluctuates with the prices of oil and natural gas 
therefore  with the recovery of oil and natural gas prices  the demand for and the costs of drilling rigs and related services have started to rise and could increase further 
in an attempt to hedge against rising drilling costs  we have in the past entered into long term  fixed rate contracts for drilling rigs that are capable of drilling on all our properties 
we expect to be able to finance our budgeted operations and development activities with cash flows from operations 
if the costs of drilling related products and services increase substantially from current levels  we believe that the available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund any capital expenditures in excess of cash flows from operations 
as a result of fluctuating oil and gas prices and the related effects on oil and gas companies  there has been an increase in the number of properties available for acquisition in the gulf coast basin 
in addition  the recent merger and acquisition transactions among both major and independent oil and gas companies  coupled with the move of many companies to the deep water region of the gulf of mexico  should increase the supply of properties available for acquisition in our area of operations 
these trends should provide us with significant opportunities to acquire properties that fit our specific acquisition profile 
while generally it is more expensive to buy properties at times when oil and natural gas prices have increased  we are somewhat insulated by our preference to acquire properties with low production rates and cash flows at the time of purchase 
at present  we do not expect that changes in the rates of overall economic growth or inflation will significantly impact product prices in the short term 
furthermore  because most of the factors that affect the prices we receive for our production are beyond our control  our marketing efforts are devoted to achieving the best price available in each geographic location and entering into a limited amount of fixed price sales and hedging transactions to take advantage of short term prices we believe to be attractive 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations and summary information with respect to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves

the results included an after tax non cash ceiling test write down of million  or per share 
excluding the write down  favorable results in net income versus were due to improvements in the following components 
production 
production volumes of oil and gas reached a record high during and  as compared to  rose and  respectively  totaling million barrels of oil and billion cubic feet of gas 
on a thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe basis  production rates for were higher than production rates 
the increase in production rates  as compared to  was due primarily to increases at four of our fields 
first  we successfully executed an aggressive exploration and development program at vermilion block by completing and placing on production three exploratory and two development wells 
at the end of  we began producing two high pressured gas wells at the south pelto block e platform  which have significantly contributed to s favorable production rates 
from june through august  we successfully drilled one exploratory well  three development wells and completed three workovers to enhance production at clovelly field 
finally  in may  we increased our interest  and therefore our share of production  at weeks island field through the acquisition of an additional working interest in producing wells 
prices 
average realized prices during were per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas and represented a increase  on an mcfe basis  over average prices of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas recognized during  including the effects of hedging 
from time to time  we enter into various hedging contracts in order to reduce our exposure to the possibility of declining oil and gas prices 
during  hedging transactions reduced the average price we received for oil by per barrel and increased the average gas price received by per mcf as compared to net increases of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas during oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues reached a record high during the favorable increases in oil and gas production rates combined with higher commodity prices resulted in oil and gas revenues increasing to million  compared to oil and gas revenues of million during expenses 
normal operating costs during increased to million  compared to million during on a unit of production basis  operating costs were per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in operating costs was due primarily to a increase in the number of producing wells that we operate as a result of the acquisitions of the lafitte field  west cameron block and east cameron block  the increases in working interest at east cameron block  eugene island block and weeks island field and discoveries at many of our fields including vermilion block  vermilion block  clovelly field and eugene island block as a result of increased production volumes due to acquisitions and discoveries combined with higher oil and gas prices during the year  production revenues from onshore properties increased during our production tax expense  however  declined during to million from million in this decrease resulted from the abatement of severance taxes for certain wells under louisiana state law 
accordingly  we accrued in december  and will receive in early  a production tax refund of million 
general and administrative expenses for increased in total to million from million during however  on a unit basis  these costs were unchanged from the amount of per mcfe 
due to our operational results and stock performance during the year  incentive compensation expense for increased to million compared to million in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense on our oil and gas properties decreased to million per mcfe compared to million per mcfe for the decrease in dd a expense resulted from a combination of the million non cash ceiling test write down of oil and gas properties recorded at the end of and the improvement in oil and gas prices throughout as a result of the july stock offering and the subsequent repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility  interest expense for decreased to million  compared to million during our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  and was net of a million reduction in deferred taxes relative to estimates of tax basis that were resolved during reserves 
at december   our estimated proved oil and gas reserves totaled bcfe  excluding approximately bcf of gas dedicated to a production payment associated with certain acquisitions  compared to december  reserves of bcfe 
oil reserves increased to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year  and gas reserves grew to bcf at december   excluding the bcf of gas dedicated to a production payment  compared to bcf at year end the increases in our estimated proved reserves were primarily attributable to drilling results and acquisitions made during the year 
the reserve estimates were prepared by independent petroleum consultants in accordance with the guidelines established by the sec 
adherence to these guidelines limited us in booking reserves on certain successfully drilled wells to the extent of the base of known productive sands 
actual limits of the productive sands will ultimately be determined through production or additional drilling 
compared to we recognized a net loss for the year ended december  totaling million  or per share  as compared to net income of million  or per share 
the results included an after tax  non cash ceiling test write down of million or per share 
during december  we initiated production from the d platform at our south pelto block field 
production from this structure  together with production increases at a number of our other fields  generated record levels of production volumes during production volumes during increased  on a mcfe basis  over the previous record production levels 
production volumes of both oil and gas during  compared to  rose and  respectively  totaling mmbbls of oil and bcf of gas 
despite a decrease in the average price received per mcfe  the growth in production volumes during resulted in oil and gas revenues rising to million  a increase from oil and gas revenues of million 
the average prices received  net of the effects of hedging contracts  for our production during were per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas  as compared to per barrel and per mcf during normal operating costs increased during to million compared to million in the increase was attributable to an increase in the number of properties and significantly higher production rates 
however  on a unit basis  these costs declined during to per mcfe from per mcfe in total dd a expense attributable to oil and gas properties increased during because of higher production rates  an increased investment in the properties and lower quarter end prices 
dd a on oil and gas properties increased to million  or per mcfe  in from million  or per mcfe  in we follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
securities and exchange commission regulations require that companies using full cost accounting value their proved year end reserves based on oil and gas prices in effect at december as a result of the low oil and gas price environment at year end  during the fourth quarter we recognized a ceiling test write down on our oil and gas properties totaling million  which on an after tax basis was million 
we anticipate that the write down will provide a positive impact on future earnings resulting from lower future unit depreciation expense 
to finance a portion of our capital expenditures budget  we increased our borrowings under our bank credit facility during as a result of these borrowings and the bond offering closed in september  interest expense increased to million during  compared to million in because of the continued increase in our level of operations during  general and administrative costs increased in total to million 
however  on a unit basis  general and administrative costs declined to per mcfe  compared with per mcfe in at december   our reserves totaled bcfe  a increase from december  reserves of bcfe 
oil reserves increased to mmbbls at the end of from mmbbls at the beginning of the year  and gas reserves grew to bcf at december  compared to bcf at year end as a result of the decline in oil and gas prices  the estimated discounted cash flows from our proved reserves declined from liquidity and capital resources cash flow and working capital 
pending the use of proceeds from the stock offering  in august we repaid all of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net cash flow from operations before working capital changes for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  reported for working capital at december  totaled million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures during totaled million and primarily consisted of exploration and development expenditures at many of our fields including eugene island block  east cameron block and vermilion block in addition to acquisition costs primarily for an additional interest in east cameron block and a working interest in west cameron block capital expenditures for included million of capitalized general and administrative costs and million of capitalized interest 
these investments were financed by a combination of cash flows from operations and production payments 
acquisition costs 
during  we acquired additional interests in three of our existing fields and completed the acquisition of four new fields 
adjacent to our south pelto block  we farmed in a working interest on south timbalier block in may  we acquired an additional working interest in a portion of the weeks island field for million 
in june  we acquired a majority interest and control of operations in the lafitte field for million in cash and a production payment to be satisfied through the sale of production from the purchased property 
during september  goodrich petroleum company  llc exercised its option to participate for a working interest in the lafitte field resulting in a cash reimbursement to us of approximately million and a proportional reduction in the production payment 
in june  we acquired from other interest owners their residual interests in certain formation rights and farmin interests on a working interest and a net revenue interest in the eugene island block field for million 
in july  we acquired a working interest in the east cameron block field and a working interest in the west cameron block field  as well as control of operations for both fields  in exchange for a volumetric production payment of bcf of gas to be delivered over a three year period from the south pelto block field 
the accounting for this volumetric production payment resulted in the recording of a million asset based upon the estimated discounted cash flow associated with the specific production volumes to be delivered 
finally  in november  we acquired a working interest in east cameron block field for million 
with the acquisitions  we now serve as operator on all of our properties 
development costs 
during  we completed numerous development drilling  workover and recompletion operations and facilities installations in an effort to develop our property base and to increase cash flow from proved reserves 
during  our development drilling program achieved a success rate consisting of the eugene island block no 
d well  the ocs g no 
h and ocs g no 
d wells at vermilion block  the clovelly corporation no 
and dereda thomas no 
wells at clovelly field and the ocs g no 
well at vermilion block the year s most significant workover projects included the ocs g no 
well at vermilion block  the ocs g no 
f  ocs g no 
and ocs g no 
wells at east cameron block and the ll e no 
and rigolets no 
wells at lafitte field  four of which were successful 
we also drilled and completed for saltwater injection the dereda thomas no 
swd well at clovelly field and upgraded the production facilities at several fields to accommodate additional production from discoveries 
exploratory costs 
in an effort to provide additions to our existing oil and gas reserve base  during  we completed drilling operations on nine exploratory wells  eight of which were successful 
these eight wells included the ocs g no 
a well at eugene island block s orca prospect  the ocs g no 
well at vermilion block s skate prospect  the ocs g no 
well at vermilion block s pylos prospect  the ocs g no 
h well at vermilion block s slide prospect  the ocs g no 
well at south timbalier block s triggerfish prospect  the ocs g no 
a stk well at vermilion block s bubble prospect and two wells under a joint venture drilling project at weeks island field the myles salt no 
well formerly named the myles salt no 
well and the meridian state lease no 
well 
budgeted capital expenditures and long term financing 
for the year  we have budgeted what would be a record year for drilling wells with new wells scheduled  including wells on properties acquired during we have budgeted million for our exploration and development plans including million for drilling on properties acquired during approximately of our capital expenditures budget has been allocated for activities at the vermilion block  eugene island block  south timbalier block  west cameron block and lafitte fields 
based upon our outlook on oil and gas prices and production rates  we believe that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the current capital expenditures budget 
if oil and gas prices or production rates fall below our current expectations  we believe that the available borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditures in excess of operating cash flows 
we believe that the opportunity for acquisitions in our area of operations remains strong due to the general exodus from the shallow water and shelf region of the gulf 
we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are currently evaluating several opportunities that fit our specific acquisition profile 
one or a combination of certain of these possible transactions could fully utilize our existing sources of capital 
although we have no plans to access the public markets for purposes of capital  if the opportunity arose  we would consider such funding sources to provide capital in excess of what is currently available to us 
we would compare and contrast the cost of debt financing with the potential dilution of equity offerings to determine the appropriate financing vehicle to maximize stockholder value 
hedging 
our production is sold on month to month contracts at prevailing prices 
from time to time  however  we have entered into hedging transactions for our oil and gas production 
the primary objective of these transactions is to reduce our exposure to future oil and gas price declines during the term of the hedge 
this hedging policy provides that  unless prices increase by more than of the prices utilized in our most recent budget  not more than one half of our production quantities can be hedged without the consent of the board of directors 
additionally  not more than of our production quantities can be committed to any swap agreement regardless of the prices available 
we currently utilize two forms of hedging contracts fixed price swaps and collars 
fixed price swaps typically provide for monthly payments by us if prices rise or to us if prices fall based on the difference between the strike price and the agreed upon average of nymex prices 
for collars  monthly payments are made by us if nymex prices rise above the ceiling price and to us if nymex prices fall below the floor price 
oil contracts typically settle using the average of the daily closing prices for a calendar month 
natural gas contracts typically settle using the average closing prices for near month nymex futures contracts for the three days prior to the settlement date 
because our properties are located in the gulf coast basin  we believe that fluctuations in nymex prices will closely match changes in market prices for our production 
during  we realized a net reduction in revenues from our hedging transactions of million 
swap contracts totaled  mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for the year 
as of march   we had hedged oil and gas prices for the applicable periods  quantities and average prices as follows fixed price swaps gas oil volume volume bbtus price bbls price first quarter    second quarter    third quarter    fourth quarter    collars gas oil volume volume bbtus floor ceiling bbls floor ceiling second quarter   third quarter    fourth quarter    the net increase in revenues from hedging transactions for was million 
swap contracts totaled mbbls of oil and  bbtus of gas  which represented approximately and  respectively  of our oil and gas production for that year 
historical financing sources 
since our initial public offering in july  we have financed our activities primarily with both debt and equity offering proceeds  cash flows from operations  production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facility 
in november  we executed a term loan agreement with bank one in the original principal amount of million for the purchase of the riverstone office building  the majority of which is used by us for our lafayette office 
during  the loan was repaid with borrowings under our bank credit facility 
in september  we completed an offering of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes the notes due september  with interest payable semiannually 
there are no sinking fund requirements on the notes and they are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at of their principal amount beginning september   and thereafter at prices declining annually to on and after september  provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales and other restricted payments 
on july   we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
after payment of the underwriting discount and expenses  we received net proceeds of million 
on august   we used a portion of the net proceeds from our stock offering to repay the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
this reduced long term debt to million  representing our senior subordinated notes 
the proceeds from the stock offering will ultimately be used to fund specifically identified exploration and development activities  to finance potential property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
during  our bank group increased the borrowing base under our credit facility from million to million 
the borrowing base limitation is based on a borrowing base amount established by the banks for our oil and gas properties 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our borrowing base and had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
in february  our bank group increased our credit facility from million to million and extended the maturity date from july  to july  our credit facility provides for certain covenants  including restrictions or requirements with respect to working capital  net worth  disposition of properties  incurrence of additional debt  change of ownership and reporting responsibilities 
these covenants may limit or prohibit us from paying cash dividends 
regulatory and litigation issues 
in august  we were advised by the epa that it believed we were a potentially responsible party a prp for the cleanup of an oil field waste disposal facility located near abbeville  louisiana  which was included on cercla s national priority list the superfund list by the epa in march although we did not dispose of wastes or salt water at this site  the epa contends that transporters of salt water may have rinsed their trucks tanks at this site 
by letter dated december   the epa made demand for cleanup costs on of the prp s  including us  who had not previously settled with the epa 
since that time we  together with other prps  have been negotiating the settlement of our respective liability for environmental conditions at this site with the us department of justice 
given the number of prp s at this site and the current satisfactory progress of these negotiations  we do not believe that any liability for this site would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
since november   new levels of lease and areawide bonds have been required of lessees taking certain actions with regard to ocs leases 
operators in the ocs waters of the gulf of mexico were required to increase their areawide bonds and individual lease bonds to million and million  respectively  unless the mms allowed exemptions or reduced amounts 
we currently have an areawide right of way bond for million and an areawide operator s bond totaling million issued in favor of the mms for our existing offshore properties 
the mms also has discretionary authority to require supplemental bonding in addition to the foregoing required bonding amounts but this authority is only exercised on a case by case basis at the time of filing an assignment of record title interest for mms approval 
based upon certain financial parameters  we have been granted exempt status by the mms  which exempts us from the supplemental bonding requirements 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
opa imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party  including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill 
as amended by the coast guard authorization act of  opa requires responsible parties of covered offshore facilities that have a worst case oil spill of more than  barrels to demonstrate financial responsibility in amounts ranging from at least million in specified state waters to at least million in federal outer continental shelf waters  with higher amounts of up to million if a formal risk assessment indicates that a higher amount should be required based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at the facility may exceed the applicable threshold volumes specified under the mms s final rule 
on august   the mms enacted a final rule implementing these financial responsibility requirements 
we do not anticipate that we will experience any difficulty in continuing to satisfy the mms s requirements for demonstrating financial responsibility under opa 
we operate under numerous state and federal laws enacted for the protection of the environment 
in the ordinary course of business  we conduct an ongoing review of the effects of these various environmental laws on our business and operations 
the estimated cost of continued compliance with current environmental laws  based upon the information currently available  is not material to our results of operations or financial position 
it is impossible to determine whether and to what extent our future performance may be affected by environmental laws  however  we believe that such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
year compliance 
the year yk issue was the result of concern that computerized systems would not be able to store and process the year portion of dates from and after january  without critical systems failure 
during and  we implemented and completed a plan to evaluate the potential yk risks of our critical information technology it and non it systems and replaced or made modifications to computer hardware and software that were deemed necessary for yk compliance 
costs expensed during the year related to yk compliance totaled  in addition  we capitalized million of computer hardware and software costs that were necessary due to the growth in our number of employees and level of operations over the past months 
as of march   we have not experienced any noticeable yk related systems failures or disruptions in the supply of materials or services provided by third parties 
forward looking statements certain of the statements set forth under this item and elsewhere in this form k are forward looking and are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
see item business forward looking statements and risk factors 
accounting matters basis of presentation 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts  our proportionate share of certain partnerships  tspc and tspc s proportionate share of certain partnerships 
in june  tspc was dissolved after the majority of its assets  including its proportionate share of certain partnerships  were transferred to us 
on december   the partnerships were also dissolved after their assets were transferred to us 
all intercompany balances and transactions that existed prior to these dissolutions have been eliminated 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition and development costs  including certain related employee costs and general and administrative costs less any reimbursements for such costs incurred for the purpose of acquiring and finding oil and gas are capitalized 
we amortize our investment in oil and gas properties using the future gross revenue method 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes have been determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax liability of million which was calculated based on our assumption that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize certain tax attribute carryforwards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risks our revenues are derived from the sale of crude oil and natural gas production 
from time to time  we enter into hedging transactions 
these hedges reduce our exposure to decreases in commodity prices and limit the benefit we might otherwise have received from any increases in commodity prices on the hedged volumes 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the prices we are projecting to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our annual revenues 
this hypothetical impact of the decline in oil and gas prices is net of the incremental increase in revenues that we would realize  upon a decline in prices  from the oil and gas hedging contracts in place as of march
