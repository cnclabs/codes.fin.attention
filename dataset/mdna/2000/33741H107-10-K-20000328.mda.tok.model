item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of first united corporation and subsidiaries collectively  the corporation including first united bank trust the bank  oakfirst life insurance corporation  gonder insurance agency  inc  and first united auto finance  llc 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the finan cial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
earnings analysis overview the corporation s net earnings for increased to million  or over the million reported for earnings for the year represent a record level of performance for the corporation  exceeding the previous record of million achieved in return on average assets was   and in   and  respectively 
the return on average shareholders equity for increased to from the reported in the return on average shareholders equity was in earnings per share increased to in from in  compared with in during the first and second quarters of the company engaged the services of alex sheshunoff management services  inc  a highly respected financial consulting group  to facilitate a process improvement program 
based on the recommendations of the alex shesunoff management services  inc  and the vision of the executive management  several positions in the organization were changed  new positions were created  and a few positions were eliminated 
all employees were offered a severance package during the restructuring process  and employees chose to accept this package 
throughout this process first united bank trust maintained its tradition of no lay offs affecting its employees 
for those employees accepting the voluntary severance package  the board of directors authorized a total of  to be charged against earnings during the first six months of forward looking statements the corporation has made certain forward looking statements with respect to this discussion 
such statements should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ from forward looking information as a result of any number of unforeseeable factors  which include  but are not limited to  the effect of prevailing economic conditions  the overall direction of government policies  unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment  competitive factors in the marketplace  and business risk ass ociated with credit extensions and trust activities  and other risk factors discussed under the heading risk factors  beginning on page above 
these and other factors could lead to actual results which differ materially from management s statements regarding future performance 
net interest income the primary source of earnings continued to be net interest income the difference between interest income and related fees on earning assets  and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowed funds 
this segment of earnings is affected by changes in interest rates  account balances and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing funding sources 
total interest income for increased over  from million to million  primarily due to growth in earning assets 
total interest expense at million represented an increase of from million in this increase was the result of growth in depository accounts as well as the effect of higher market rates being paid 
interest on the recently issued other long term debt resulted in an increase of 
million to interest expense 
during  the corporation increased its use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
interest on this type of borrowing increased by million to a total of million 
the net effect of these changes was a increase in net interest income to million in from million in this compares to million in the improvement in represents an increase of over s net interest income 
table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equiv alent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to in from in  compared with in table compares the components of the net interest margin and the changes occurring between  and allowance for possible credit losses the reserve for possible credit losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of non performing loans and leases 
the corporation utilizes the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie commercial and homogeneous ie consumer loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of potential losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by the gathering of information from internal  reg ulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations are made for those loans in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
allocations are made for loan commitments using the methodology outlined above 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured or for the sba guaranteed portion of loans 
during  management continued to place emphasis on procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups 
as a result of these efforts  the provision for credit losses in increased to million or of gross loans 
the provision for credit losses was million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross charge offs for the years ended december    and totaled   and 
million  respectively 
table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years 
table presents management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan catagory 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category 
other operating income the corporation and its subsidiaries continue to seek ways of obtaining add itional other operating income 
many of the changes the corporation implemented in are fueling the growth in other operating income 
non interest income for  at million  increased over the million earned in income from our insurance subsidiaries increased 
million or over levels 
due to the competitive nature of today s market  service charges on deposits declined 
million or 
the corporation experienced an increase of 
million in fees from trust and fiduciary activities 
the growth in these nontraditional services mentioned above accounted for most of the increase of in non interest income over the million earned in other operating expense non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in the increase can be explained by large increases in several categories 
expenses relating to year readiness  fees and incentives paid to members of our indirect lending network  and contract labor used in improving our internal technology accounted for most of the increase 
while some of these expenses will continue to grow  others represent investments in future efficiencies 
salaries and employee benefits increased 
million or in to a total of million 
the total of million represented an increase of 
million or over the total of million 
this increase is due in part to the acquisition of gonder insurance agency gonder 
salaries and benefits related to gonder equaled 
million for the year ending december  another factor contributing to the increase was the further expansion of the corporate incentive pay program 
this program rewards sales associates who exceed their expected levels of production 
the corporation incurred a decrease in of 
million in occupancy expense of premises to 
million 
this decrease is due to the closings of three in store branches 
occupancy expense of premises was comp arable at million and 
million in and  respectively 
expenditures to further increase the role of technology in improving the efficiency of customer service delivery and internal processing activities accounted for much of the increase in equipment expenses 
expansion of the cust omer service center also contributed to an increase in equipment related expenses 
it is anticipated that the long run efficiencies gained by projects such as these will be a net benefit to the earnings performance of the corp oration 
impact of the year project overview the corporation began its year project in to pre pare its systems for the century date change 
this situation arose when computer systems and programs were originally designed eliminating the first two digits of the century  thereby saving valuable and costly disk and memory space 
with out appropriate year computer system renovations  such systems may not have recognized a date using as the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  a temp orary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activity 
project readiness the federal financial institutions examination council guidelines required that the corporation s year project plan contain these phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
as of december   we have completed all these phases  as well as undergone two independent reviews of our year efforts by an independent third party 
the corporation has successfully completed the transition into the year with no material issues 
all systems and outside connections to outside vendors were properly tested and validated 
there were no disruptions in service to our custo mers or system availability 
as with any business  the corporation is depend ent on third parties for many of our mission critical functions 
we closely monitored the progress of these third parties in regards to the readiness of their systems for the year the corporation considers all mission critical vendor supplied products and services to be compliant 
costs costs involved in the year issue included modifying software  hiring year solution providers  testing and validation of all systems  and ass uring customer awareness 
the estimated total cost of the project is expected to be approximately 
million 
costs incurred and expensed through december   were approximately 
million 
the majority of the remaining cost is associated with retesting mission critical systems for any foreseen problems after the date change 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in as compared with million in and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of   and for   and  respectively 
investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an in definite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and int erest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity  net of income taxes 
the corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near term resales and therefore  does not own trading sec urities 
for additional information  see notes and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 was issued 
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for fin ancial statements issued for all quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  as permitted  the corporation early adopted this statement on july  with 
the exception of the reclassification listed below  the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements as the company does not enter into derivative contracts 
in connection with the adoption of this statement  million of the investment securities previously classified as held to maturity were re classified to available for sale 
as the securities were marked to market coin cident with the reclassification  the change resulted in an increase of 
million  net of tax  to other comprehensive income 
total investment securities available for sale increased million or in from million in to million in invest ment securities were purchased with the proceeds of long term debt that was issued late in the third quarter of the corporation reported a decrease of million or during in its us treasury securities from million in to 
million in total obligations of state and pol itical subdivision investments increased million or in to million 
other investments  which include mortgage back securities  increased million or to a total of million 
the changes in composition of the investment portfolio represent an effort by management to extend the maturity of the portfolio and to obtain a higher yield 
the corporation manages its investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity risk  meet earnings objectives and provide required collateral support for dep osit activities 
excluding the us government sponsored agencies  the corp oration had no concentrations of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity 
table exhibits the distribution  by type  of the investment portfolio for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
loan and lease portfolio the corporation  through its bank  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley and hampshire counties in west virginia and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for possible credit losses 
these pol icies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan and the experience of the lend ing officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
it has been the historical policy of the corporation to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
however  with the competitive nature of the banking industry  the corporation is forced to look in non traditional markets to expand its business 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december  during  gross loans increased million or to a total of million 
in comparison  gross loans at year end increased million or to a total of million as compared to the bal ances 
the indirect lending portfolio experienced substantial growth in this portfolio grew from million at december  to million as of december  the corporation continued to expand its pre sence in the indirect market by forming an automobile leasing company in late as of december   the corporation has booked leases totaling million 
this product should continue to see substantial growth in the years to come 
table details the dollar amount and percentage distribution of the various key categories of credit in the loan portfolio 
funding for loan growth during and was provided by increased levels of deposits from within our market area  brokered deposits  and from borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan on non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay prin cipal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan and the over all economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
non accrual loans are closely monitored by management 
a non accruing loan is res tored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   the corporation had 
million of non accrual loans 
table details the historical activity of non accrual loans 
deposit and other funding deposit liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   or an increase of 
the increase of million in deposits includes million of brokered deposits 
in order to support the high levels of loan demand  these deposits were sought as an alternative to additional borrowings from the fhlb and various upstream correspondent banks 
traditional deposits raised through a variety of deposit campaigns accounted for the remaining growth 
borrowings from the fhlb increased from million at december  to million at december  this represents an increase of over the previous year 
the corp oration has an approved credit line with the fhlb which equals of first united bank trust s total assets 
as of december   the approved credit line equaled million 
available borrowings are million 
the increased competition from other banks  brokerage firms  and other financial outlets has caused the corporation to look to non traditional sources to cost effectively meet its liquidity needs 
first united capital trust the trust  a delaware business trust organized by the corporation on july   issued million of aggregate liquidation amount of preferred securities the capital securities 
the payment terms require the trust to distribute per liquidation amount of capital securities on march  june  september and december of each year  beginning september  under the federal reserve board s current risk based capital guidelines  the capital securities are includable in the corporation s tier i and tier ii capital 
for financial statement purposes these securities are classified as other borrowed funds 
see note for additional detail 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations which were adopted by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy  and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the reserve for possible credit losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based cap ital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supple mented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking org anizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset qual ity  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking comp anies must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treat ment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based dep osit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guide lines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
on december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  res pectively 
total shareholders equity remained stable  decreasing slightly from million at year end to million at year end the slight decline in shareholders equity can be explained by increased shareholder dividends and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total shareholders equity at december  was million 
the equity to assets ratio at december   was  compared with and at year end and  respectively 
on july   as part of the corporation s capital plan  the board of directors also authorized the corporation s officers to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
purchases of the corporation s stock under the program were completed in brokered transactions or directly from the corp oration s market makers 
on april   the board of directors ratified an amendment to the plan which would enable the corporation s management to repurchase an additional or  shares 
as of december    or of the previously outstanding shares have been repurchased and retired under the plan authorized by the board of directors 
cash dividends of

this represents a dividend payout rate dividends per share divided by net income per share of   and for   and  respectively 
asset and liability management introduction the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and imp lementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal demands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s del ineated market areas are accommodated 
total liquid assets  represented by cash  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in banks  investment securities available for sale and loans and leases maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million  or of year end assets  and million  or of year end assets 
additional liquidity of million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing int erest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and sim ulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by manage ment indicated that the corporation was liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on pre tax income of changes in interest rates  manage ment has assumed that any changes would immediately effect earnings 
normally when an organization is liability sensitive there is a positive impact to income when interest rates decline 
the simulation analysis shown below shows a pos itive impact when interest rates decline or basis points in and a negative impact in management explains the effect due to the then current position of interest rates  whereby certain liability accounts were priced at a level where management felt they could not be reduced further in rate  therefore  the full impact of repricing liabilities in the declining rate environment was not realized 
based on the simulation analysis performed at year end  the corporation estimates the following changes in income before taxes assuming the indicated interest rate changes december  basis point increase million basis point increase million basis point decline 
million basis point decline 
million december  basis point increase 
million basis point increase 
million basis point decline 
million basis point decline 
million this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purch ased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin
