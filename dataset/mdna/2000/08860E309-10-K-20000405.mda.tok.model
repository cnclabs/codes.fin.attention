item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at the end of the third quarter of  beyond 
com made a strategic decision to refocus the company s business from a consumer retail focused company to a business to business e commerce services company 
under this new direction  we plan to focus our resources and expertise in two areas that we believe have substantial revenue growth and profit potential our estore and government systems groups 
while we will still sell software and computer related products via the beyond 
com website  we do not intend to spend significant advertising dollars to attract new customers to the website as we have done in the past 
instead  we plan to expand our existing consumer customer base through our affiliates program  and direct email campaigns while leveraging our website to help promote and grow our estore and government systems groups 
notwithstanding our recent shift in focus  we intend to continue to reassess our business and it is possible that  under certain circumstances  portions of our business maybe sold to enable us to more narrowly focus on our estore group 
as part of this refocus  the company reduced its workforce by approximately employees in january  or approximately of its total workforce  and began consolidating facilities and disposing of excess capital assets 
additionally  the company terminated its existing marketing agreements focused on generating consumer sales with aol  cnet  excite  yahoo and zdnet during february and march at a cost of approximately million in termination fees 
in addition  the company expects to record a restructuring charge of between million to million in the first quarter of management expects the workforce reduction  facilities consolidation  and termination of marketing agreements will lower future operating expenses and reduce cash obligations for the remainder of fiscal estore group beyond 
com s estore group allows software publishers  hardware manufacturers and systems oems to launch a full service web store in at a substantially lower total cost than they would incur if they developed a similar system internally 
businesses can choose from an array of services  including website design and construction  transaction processing  physical and electronic order fulfillment  customer support  marketing  merchandising support  fraud management  tax payment  currency conversion and reporting 
our current estore customers include cadopia  compaq computer  executive software  hp shopping village a subsidiary of hewlett packard  mcafee 
com  palm computing  symantec  systran software  telex and trend micro 
we will derive revenue for our estore group from two different business models 
one model  where we earn revenues by reselling the products of our estore customers  is a traditional reseller model that is characterized by higher per transaction revenue but lower margins 
the second model  where we are paid fees based on the transactions we complete and the services we render  is a transaction and services model which typically has lower revenue per transaction but higher potential gross margins 
in the near term  we expect our gross margins will fluctuate around our current levels  depending on the mix of these two models in any given quarter 
we believe in the long term  as we migrate to a higher percentage of customers under the transaction model and leverage our merchandising expertise and digital service capabilities  our gross margins will be higher than current levels 
government systems group beyond 
com s government systems group provides digitally downloadable software and related services to a growing list of us government agencies including the internal revenue service irs  office of the comptroller of the currency occ  bureau of engraving and printing bep  office of thrift supervision ots  defense logistics agency dla  national imagery and mapping agency nima  patent and trademark office pto  and the department of defense dod 
website beyond 
com s online store www 
beyond 
com  offers customers a comprehensive selection of software and computer related products  customer reviews  customer service  and competitive prices 
we deliver software to customers by physically delivering the shrink wrap software package  or over the internet via digital download 
we carry approximately  software stock keeping units and approximately  of these stock keeping units can be delivered to customers via digital download 
general each year since inception  we have incurred increasingly larger net losses 
these annual net losses increased from million in  to million in  to million in we anticipate our operating expenses will decrease from levels as a result of our restructuring  lower headcount  reduced advertising and business model transition 
however  our de emphasis on advertising to promote our brand and our reallocation of resources to the estore group could result in dramatically reduced revenues and increased losses  if the market does not accept our estore product 
as we currently have relatively low gross margins  our ability to become profitable given our planned expenses depends on our ability to generate and sustain higher net revenues 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we do not expect to achieve operating break even until at least the fourth quarter of we have little experience forecasting our revenues 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
if we cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flows from operations  we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations or working capital requirements  which would adversely effect our business 
acquisition of buydirect 
com on march   a wholly owned subsidiary of beyond 
com merged with and into buydirect

com s stockholders in exchange for their outstanding shares of buydirect 
com common and preferred stock 
beyond 
com assumed options to purchase  shares of its common stock in connection with the merger 
we accounted for the merger using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price of approximately million included the fair market value of the common stock of million  the fair value of the fully vested options assumed of million  liabilities assumed of million and the acquisition costs incurred in connection with the merger 
the fair value of the unvested options assumed of million has been recorded as deferred compensation 
the intangible assets resulting from the merger are being amortized to expense over the estimated useful lives of one to three and one half years 
we recorded approximately million in goodwill amortization expense in acquisition of softgallery on october   beyond

the european revenue contingencies are only applicable if beyond 
com meets certain marketing and business development commitments in europe 
these shares will be held in escrow and will be delivered in various intervals through october as softgallery meets the revenue targets and employment contingencies 
the common stock that was issuable on the date of the acquisition and was not subject to the revenue target or employment contingencies was valued at approximately  based on the closing price on the date of the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the total purchase price was approximately million and included the fair value of the common shares issued of approximately  a cash payment of  liabilities assumed of  and acquisition costs of approximately  the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and is being amortized over the estimated useful life of four years 
on the date of the acquisition  beyond did not record the value of the contingent consideration to be issued because these amounts were not earned and were subject to the revenue targets and employment contingencies 
the value of the remaining shares subject to the revenue targets and employment contingencies will be recorded as compensation expense as the shares are earned pursuant to the terms of the agreement

the company s revenues are primarily derived from two sources the operation of estores and resale of computer software 
our revenues include sales of software to customers using credit cards  to corporate customers that are invoiced directly under credit terms  to us government agencies pursuant to contractual arrangements and  to a lesser extent  amounts received from software publishers for advertising and promotion 
revenue from the sale of software  net of estimated returns  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  either shipment of the physical product or delivery of the electronic product has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is considered probable 
sales of software under contracts with the us government require continuing service  support and performance by the company 
accordingly  the related revenues and costs are deferred and recognized over the period the service  support and performance are provided 
revenues derived from software publishers for advertising and promotion are recognized as the services are provided 
costs of deferred revenue relate to software licenses purchased from software publishers for sales to us government agencies 
as our business model shifts away from aggressive advertising promotion of our consumer business  we may not be able to develop the estore service to replace potential lost consumer revenues 
this could have an adverse affect on our business and could impact our ability to meet our debt service payments

we received net cash of million in from financing activities from proceeds of our second public offering in april we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december   will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  we expect that the cash we generate from operations likely will not be sufficient to satisfy our longer term cash needs 
we will need significant amounts of cash to make a variety of payments  in the longer term including payment of the principal and interest on convertible subordinated notes when due  continued investment in technical infrastructure  and payment of ongoing operating expenses 
we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise cash to meet these obligations 
such sales likely would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in addition  we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
year many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year 
these programs were designed and developed without addressing the impact of the recent change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer software applications could fail or create erroneous results beyond the year we assessed our proprietary software and our internally developed systems  which permit the sale  order  processing and delivery of off the shelf software to our customers to determine year compliance 
we searched through software code for each of these applications and identified all instances where date specific information is required 
we further investigated whether these date fields contain two or four digits 
we believe our other proprietary software and internally developed systems are year compliant 
in addition to our proprietary software and internally developed systems  we utilize software  computer technology and other services internally developed and provided by third party vendors that may fail due to the year phenomenon 
for example  we are dependent on the institutions involved in processing our members credit card payments for internet services 
we are also dependent on telecommunications vendors and leased point of purchase vendors to maintain network reliability 
our software applications run on several hardware platforms and associated operating systems 
in addition  our software operates in accordance with several external internet protocols  such as http and nntp 
our software is therefore dependent upon the correct processing of dates by these systems and protocols 
we reviewed information made publicly available by our hardware platform providers regarding year compliance and researched the date handling capabilities of applicable internet protocols 
we do not believe that the underlying systems and protocols that operate in conjunction with our software applications contain material year deficiencies 
we use multiple software systems for our internal business purposes  including accounting  email  development  human resources  customer service and support  and sales tracking systems 
we have made inquiries of vendors of the systems that we believe are mission critical to our business regarding their year readiness 
each of these vendors has indicated to us that it believes its applications are year compliant  although we have not received affirmative documentation in this regard from any of these vendors 
to date  we have not experienced any material year problems with regards to our proprietary software  internally developed systems  and hardware or software platforms developed by external vendors 
introduction of the euro currency in january  the new euro currency was introduced in certain european countries that are part of the european monetary union emu 
during  all emu countries are expected to completely replace their national currencies with the euro 
a significant amount of uncertainty exists as to the effect the euro will have on the marketplace generally and  additionally  all of the final rules and regulations have not yet been defined and finalized by the european commission with regard to the euro currency 
we list the prices for our products  accounts  and invoices for sales and collect payments in us dollars  even for sales outside the us we currently utilize third party vendor equipment and software products that may or may not be emu compliant 
although we are currently taking steps to address the impact  if any  of emu compliance for such third party products  the failure of any critical component to operate properly during and after the euro conversion process may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations or require us to incur expenses to remedy such problems

it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
these cautionary statements should be considered in the context of the factors listed below  as well as those disclosed from time to time in the company s reports on forms q and k 
additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein include the following risk factors we must establish our new business model we must launch and operate our estore business model successfully and generate adequate revenue and gross margin to replace an expected decrease in revenue we may incur in the consumer market as we scale back on our consumer branding efforts 
we have limited experience in operating our estore business and cannot give any assurances that we will be able to fully build this business 
we have a limited operating history and have incurred net losses since inception and expect future losses we began selling software on our website in november as a result  we have only a limited operating history upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
additionally  as we refocus the company to an e commerce services provider model from a consumer oriented business model our prior operating history does not offer significant information upon which you may evaluate our business and prospectus as we proceed into fiscal and beyond 
we incurred net losses of approximately million from inception of our business through as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate significant losses and negative cash flow we expect significant operating losses and negative cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future 
because we have relatively low gross margins  our ability to become profitable given our planned expenses depends on our ability to generate and sustain higher net revenues 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we base our current and future expense levels  which are largely fixed  on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
we find sales and operating results difficult to forecast  because they generally depend on the volume and timing of the orders we receive 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
a shortfall in revenues will significantly harm our business and operating results 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  proposed and possible future acquisitions and our limited operating history of selling software online  we have little experience forecasting our revenues 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future performance 
if we cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations or working capital requirements  which would adversely affect our business 
our future operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
these factors include our ability to attract and retain new customers and maintain customer satisfaction  new websites  services and products introduced by us or by our competitors  price competition  decreases in the level of growth  use of or consumer acceptance of the internet and online services or consumer acceptance of the internet and other online services for the purchase of consumer products  the termination of contracts with major purchasers  particularly us government agencies  technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the internet or online services  generally  and estore websites for customers or the operation of our website  the failure of internet bandwidth to increase significantly over time and or an increase in the cost to consumers of obtaining or using internet bandwidth  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business  operations and infrastructure  government regulations related to use of the internet for commerce or sales and distribution of software  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce and the software industry 
we must successfully execute our new estore strategy 
this includes adding significant new estore clients in the software and computer peripherals markets while adding additional high margin services that are valued by our customers 
we must also increase the number of repeat purchasers of software through our online sites and increase revenues from purchasers of digitally downloadable software products 
in addition  we must successfully maintain the beyond 
com brand 
we cannot be certain that we can accomplish these objectives or that our business strategy will be successful 
seasonal fluctuations in the software industry  internet and commercial online service usage  and traditional retail  government and corporate seasonal spending patterns and advertising expenditures may affect our business 
in particular  internet and online service usage and its rate of growth may decline in the summer 
these seasonal patterns may cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and could adversely and materially affect our financial performance 
our gross margins are likely to fluctuate over time 
a number of factors may impact our gross margins  including the mix of revenues between our estores group  government systems group and our website  the mix of transaction versus reseller revenue in our estore business  the mix of revenues from sales of shrink wrap products and products delivered through digital download  the mix of revenues from sales of software products and computer peripheral products such as joysticks  personal organizers and related products  the amount of advertising or promotional revenues we receive  and our ability to rapidly grow value added services for our estore business 
we realize higher gross margins from advertising and promotional revenues than from software products sales  product sales through digital download than from sales of shrink wrap software products  sales of specialty software products than from sales of widely available commodity software products  and consulting and marketing services for estores  than from transaction fees 
we believe that the size of new software products will continue to increase and that they will be suitable for digital download only if network bandwidth increases significantly 
this trend may limit our ability to distribute such software products via digital download and may limit our ability to realize the higher gross margins associated with digital download software product sales 
any change in one or more of these factors could adversely and materially affect our gross margins and operating results in future periods 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indicator of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
we need additional capital to fund our business we require substantial working capital to fund our business in the longer term 
we expect operating losses and negative cash flow to continue for the foreseeable future 
we will likely have to raise additional funds  in part to make interest payments to holders of our convertible subordinated notes 
we may elect to seek additional funds at any time 
the actual amount and timing of our longer term future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates 
in particular  our estimates may be inaccurate as a result of changes and fluctuations in our revenues  operating costs and development expenses 
our revenues and costs also depend upon factors that we cannot control 
these factors include changes in technology and regulations  increased competition and factors such as web integrity  seasonality  and performance by third parties in connection with our operations 
because of these factors  our actual revenues and costs are uncertain and may vary considerably 
these variations may significantly affect our future need for capital 
we may be unable to raise financing sufficient for our needs  either on suitable terms or at all 
this will hinder our ability to satisfy our obligations to holders of our convertible subordinated notes 
this result would substantially harm the trading price of our common stock and materially harm our business 
we will require substantial amounts of capital for debt service and potential repayment of the convertible subordinated notes in by selling the convertible subordinated notes in november and december  we incurred  principal amount of indebtedness 
we will likely require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our convertible subordinated notes  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
we will not be able to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations 
we also may be unable to obtain alternative financing 
a lack of adequate financing may adversely affect our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  make future acquisitions  absorb negative operating results  or fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements 
we could attempt to refinance our convertible subordinated notes if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to repay them at maturity 
however  a refinancing might not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to make necessary payments on our convertible subordinated notes  we will be in default under the terms of our convertible subordinated notes  and may also be in default under agreements controlling our other indebtedness  if any 
any default by us under our convertible subordinated notes or on other indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
our markets are highly competitive beyond 
com faces competition primarily on three fronts e commerce service vendors of various types  government resellers and systems integrators  and online resellers of software and computer peripherals 
e commerce service vendors the e commerce business to business outsourcing marketplace for building and managing web stores is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as current and new competitors potentially launch new e commerce services that offer a variety of outsourcing options to businesses 
estore competitors include digital river  releasenow  netsales and shopnow 
these companies provide similar solutions to beyond 
com s estore group offering 
like beyond 
com  they target the software and hardware industry and similar customers ranging from small to large businesses 
other competitors include escalate  buynow and sykes enterprises 
escalate and buynow are still new to the market but could pose a competitive threat once established 
sykes enterprises has a solid clientele in the software and hardware industry and could be a competitive threat if they become an end to end or full service provider 
competitive pressures created by any one of these current or future competitors  or by our competitors collectively  could negatively impact our business 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are skill in building and managing web stores that offer a wide array of services  including advertising  merchandising  marketing campaigns  banner campaigns  market research and strategic planning 
marketing services include direct emails with personalized messages  e packaging solutions that allow customers to rent  demo and download software  update services that inform clients of new upgrades to their software  and e business centers that target business to business clients  expertise in web user interface design  proprietary technology and operational experience in digital download  rapid website building time  operational and service performance excellence in the areas of customer support and site uptime  offering additional services  including fraud elimination services  providing a one stop solution through key partnerships with companies such as cybercash  preview systems and ingram micro that allow companies to outsource some of their services and alleviate internal resources  and expertise in integrating with a client s infrastructure 
competitors such as digital river have longer operating histories and larger customer bases than we do 
in addition  some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  as more businesses turn to e commerce outsourcers to market and sell their products online  well established and well financed entities may acquire online competitors  invest in online competitors  or form joint ventures with online competitors 
certain of our actual or potential competitors  such as digital river  releasenow  netsales  shopnow and buynow  may be able to secure key partnerships with vendors that allow them to outsource their services at a better price we can  secure key partnerships that enable them greater access to potential customers  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing or services models to build market share  or devote substantially more resources to grow and improve their e commerce outsourcing offerings than we can 
government resellers and systems integrators in the government services marketplace  competitors such as software spectrum  gtsi  asap  cdw g  softmart  gmr  ma federal  shi 
com  and corporate software technology have greater experience in selling software to the large enterprise market than we do 
further  they have more sophisticated infrastructure and larger sales teams than we do 
online resellers of software and computer peripherals for the beyond 
com website competition  we expect challenges from current online resellers  such as  amazon 
com  buy 
com  compusa  cyberian outpost  and egghead  which may have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  and greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  new technologies and expansion of existing technologies  such as price comparison programs that select specific titles from a variety of websites  may direct customers to online software resellers that compete with us and may increase our competition 
in summary  increased competition may cause us to reduce pricing or increase service and marketing expenses that could reduce operating margins and funds available to improve our technology and promote our business 
we cannot assure that we can compete successfully against current and future competitors 
failure to compete successfully against our current and future competitors could materially hurt our business 
we rely on software publishers and distributors we are entirely dependent upon the software publishers and distributors that supply us with software and computer products for resale  and the availability of these software and computer products is unpredictable 
in and  sales of software provided by microsoft and by a major software distributor accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
as is common in the industry  we have no long term or exclusive arrangements with any software publishers or distributors that guarantee the availability of software for resale 
for example  our agreement with microsoft automatically renews for successive one year periods but is terminable for any reason by days written notice prior to the expiration of the given term 
although we believe that we can replace our relationship with the major software distributor without much difficulty  if this relationship terminates then the publishers or distributors that currently supply us with software might cease to continue to supply us  and we might be unable to establish new relationships with other software publishers and distributors 
we also rely on software distributors to ship shrink wrap software to customers that do not use digital download 
we have limited control over the shipping procedures of our distributors and shipments by these distributors have in the past been  and may in the future be  subject to delays 
although most software we sell carries a warranty from its publisher  publishers or distributors occasionally fail to reimburse us for returns from customers 
furthermore  our contract with microsoft allows microsoft to review and approve our creditworthiness 
if microsoft determines that we are not creditworthy or not in compliance with payment or reporting terms  it may require us to post security acceptable to them which could negatively impact our financial condition 
our customers are concentrated  we are subject to risks associated with reliance on contracts with us government agencies we have several contracts with us government agencies which accounted for approximately of our net revenues in each of these contracts is subject to annual review and renewal by the government  and may be terminated at any time 
each government contract  option and extension is only valid if the government appropriates enough funds for expenditure on such contracts  options or extensions 
accordingly  we might fail to derive any revenue from sales of software to the us government in any given future period 
if the us government fails to renew or terminates any of these contracts it would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our common stock price is volatile the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new sales formats or new products or services by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the internet and online commerce industries  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other internet  online service or retail companies  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of common stock 
in addition  the securities market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of the securities of internet related and technology companies have been especially volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of stock  many companies have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were to be sued in a securities class action  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
we are subject to risks associated with dependence on the internet and internet infrastructure development our success will depend in large part on continued growth in  and the use of  the internet 
there are critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  which remain unresolved 
the issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  which we expect will affect the development of the market for our services include security  reliability  cost  ease of access  quality of service  and necessary increases in bandwidth availability 
the adoption of the internet for information retrieval and exchange  commerce and communications  particularly by those enterprises that have historically relied upon traditional means of commerce and communications  generally will require that these enterprises accept a new medium for conducting business and exchanging information 
these entities likely will accept this new medium only if the internet provides them with greater efficiency and an improved area of commerce and communication 
demand and market acceptance of the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are dependent on a number of factors  including the growth in consumer access to and acceptance of new interactive technologies  the development of technologies that facilitate interactive communication between organizations and targeted audiences and increases in user bandwidth 
if the internet fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect as a commercial or business medium  it will adversely affect our business 
we are subject to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud a significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
to securely transmit confidential information  such as customer credit card numbers  we rely on encryption and authentication technology that we license from third parties 
to the extent that our activities or those of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our business may be adversely affected if our security measures do not prevent security breaches  and we cannot assure that we can prevent all security breaches 
in addition  we have suffered losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even though the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders 
under current credit card practices  a merchant is liable for fraudulent credit card transactions where  as is the case with the transactions we process  that merchant does not obtain a cardholder s signature 
fraudulent use of credit card data in the future could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to risks associated with digital download our success will depend in part on our customers accepting digital download as a method of buying software 
we typically derive higher gross margins from software sales to consumers via digital download than we do on shrink wrap software sales 
digital download is a relatively new method of selling software products and its growth and market acceptance is highly uncertain and subject to a number of factors  including the availability of sufficient network bandwidth to enable purchasers to rapidly download software  the impact of time based internet access fees  the number of software titles that are available for purchase through digital download as compared to those available through traditional methods  the level of consumer comfort with the process of downloading software  and the relative ease of this process and transaction security concerns 
we believe there is a maximum size of a software product that most consumers are willing to purchase via digital download 
we also believe that the size of new software products will continue to increase and that these software products will be unsuitable for digital download without significant increases in network bandwidth 
it will adversely affect our business if digital download fails to achieve widespread market acceptance 
even if digital download achieves widespread acceptance  we might not overcome the substantial existing and future technical challenges associated with electronically delivering software reliably and consistently on a long term basis 
this would also adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on key personnel and need additional personnel our future success depends on the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly william s 
mckiernan  chairman of our board of directors  and c 
richard neely  jr  our interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
competition for qualified management personnel is intense  particularly in the silicon valley area  and we may be unable to successfully attract  assimilate  or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in the future 
we are subject to capacity constraint risks  reliance on internally developed systems and system development risks an element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic on  and use of  our website 
our revenues depend in part  on the number of customers who use our website to purchase software 
accordingly  our website  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure performance  reliability and availability are critical to our operating results 
these factors are also critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain adequate customer service levels 
the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our product and service offerings will decrease if there are any systems interruptions that affect the availability of our website or our ability to fulfill orders 
we have experienced periodic systems interruptions  which we believe may continue to occur 
we are continually enhancing and expanding our technology and transaction processing systems  and network infrastructure and other technologies  to accommodate a substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our website 
we may be unsuccessful in these efforts or we may be unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases in the use of our website 
we may also fail to timely expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases 
in addition  we cannot predict whether additional network capacity will be available from third party suppliers as we need it 
also  our network or our suppliers network might be unable to timely achieve or maintain a sufficiently high capacity of data transmission to timely process orders or effectively conduct digital download  especially if our website traffic increases 
our failure to achieve or maintain high capacity data transmission could significantly reduce consumer demand for our services 
we may have potential conflicts of interest with cybersource in connection with the spin off of our internet commerce services business to cybersource in december  we entered into agreements with cybersource to define the ongoing relationship between the two companies 
at the time these agreements were negotiated  all of our directors were also directors of cybersource and other members of our management team joined cybersource as executive officers 
as a result  these and subsequent agreements may not be deemed the result of arm s length negotiations 
further  although cybersource and beyond 
com are engaged in different businesses  the two companies currently have no policies to govern the pursuit or allocation of corporate opportunities between cybersource and beyond 
com in the event they arise 
our business could be adversely affected if the overlapping board members of the two companies pursue cybersource s interests over ours either in the course of intercompany transactions or where the same corporate opportunities are available to both companies 
we are subject to risk of system failure  our systems are located in single facility our success  in particular our ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and provide high quality customer service  largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
substantially all of our development and management systems are in a single facility we lease in santa clara  california 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake and similar events 
we have no formal disaster recovery plan and carry insufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur 
furthermore  our security mechanisms or those of our suppliers may not prevent security breaches or service breakdowns 
despite our implementation of security measures  our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these events could cause interruptions or delays in our business  loss of data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders 
rapid technological change may adversely affect us to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our online store 
the internet and the online commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product and service introductions 
if competitors introduce products and services embodying new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge  then our existing website  proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete 
our future success will depend on our ability to do the following both license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
to develop our website and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may use new technologies ineffectively  or we may fail to adapt our website  proprietary technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we face material delays in introducing new services  products and enhancements then our customers may forego the use of our services and use those of our competitors 
we may not successfully protect our proprietary rights we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade dress  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks and service marks in the us  and have applied for the registration of our trademarks and service marks 
we applied for federal registration of the service marks beyond 
com on july   and beyond dot com on july   although we cannot be certain that federal registration of these service marks or any other service mark will issue 
in addition  effective trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable in every country in which our products and services are available online 
we have licensed in the past  and expect to license in the future  certain of our proprietary rights  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that these licensees maintain the quality of our brand  the licensees could take actions that materially harm the value of our proprietary rights or reputation 
furthermore  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate or third parties might infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
we may have to litigate in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management and technical resources which could harm our business 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and result in the loss of significant rights other parties may assert infringement or unfair competition claims against us 
in the past  other parties have sent us notice of claims of infringement of proprietary rights  and we expect to receive other notices in the future 
we cannot predict whether others will assert claims of infringement against us  or whether any past or future assertions or prosecutions will adversely affect our business 
if we are forced to defend against any such claims  whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor  then we may face wasted time  costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  or product shipment delays 
as a result of such a dispute  we may have to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if there is a successful claim of product infringement against us and we are unable to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis  it could adversely affect our business 
we may become subject to additional government regulation laws and regulations directly applicable to communications or commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the most recent session of the us congress resulted in internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union recently enacted its own privacy regulations 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel  contracts and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the us and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
we may be liable for internet content we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to deliver original and compelling descriptive content about the software products we sell on the internet 
as a publisher of online content  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute 
in the past  plaintiffs have brought such claims and sometimes successfully litigated them against online services 
in addition  in the event that we implement a greater level of interconnectivity on our website  we will not and cannot practically screen all of the content our users generate or access  which could expose us to liability with respect to such content 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may be inadequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed on us 
if we face liability  particularly liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage  then our reputation and our business may suffer 
we may be subject to sales and other taxes we do not currently collect sales or other similar taxes for physical shipments of goods into states other than california  virginia and the district of columbia 
we do not currently collect sales or other similar taxes for digital download of goods into states other than the district of columbia 
however  one or more local  state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out of state companies which engage in online commerce 
in addition  any new operations in states outside california and the district of columbia  including operations assumed in connection with the proposed buydirect 
com merger  could subject our shipments into such states to state sales taxes under current or future laws 
if one or more states or any foreign country successfully asserts that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise  it could adversely affect our business 
management and certain stockholders can exercise significant influence over beyond 
com as of march   based upon  shares outstanding as of december   william s 
mckiernan  the chairman of our board of directors  and his respective affiliates beneficially own in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock 
therefore  if william s 
mckiernan and his respective affiliates act together  they will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in our control which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to risks associated with global expansion although we sell software to customers outside the us  we have no overseas fulfillment or distribution facility or arrangement 
we also have no website content localized for foreign markets 
therefore  we may be unable to expand our global presence effectively 
in addition  international operations are subject to inherent risks  including regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  the united states imposes export restrictions on certain software because of its encryption technology and we may face liability if we violate these restrictions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our million convertible subordinated notes 
foreign currency risk 
to date we have not experienced material risks associated with foreign currencies as a result of our operations 
however  with our expansion internationally  we will be exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies during fiscal investment risk 
to date  we have not invested in equity instruments of companies
