item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in connection with item selected financial data  and item financial statements 
general the company has been engaged since in the purchase and sale of name brand  close out and regularly available general merchandise 
since that time  the company has sold its merchandise on a wholesale basis through its bargain wholesale division 
on august   the company opened its first cents only stores location and as of march   operates a chain of deep discount cents only stores 
the company s growth during the last three years has come primarily from new store openings 
the company opened ten  thirteen and eighteen stores in  and  respectively ten  eleven and fourteen respectively  net of relocated stores 
including the scheduled opening of the company s second store in las vegas  nevada on march   the company will have opened eight stores in the first three months of the year  seven in southern california and one in las vegas  nevada 
the company plans to open at least additional net new stores during the remainder of the year 
the company has secured sites for eight additional store locations 
bargain wholesale s growth over the three years ended december  was primarily attributable to an increased focus on large domestic accounts and expansion into new geographic markets 
the company generally realizes a lower gross profit margin on bargain wholesale s net sales compared to its retail net sales 
however  bargain wholesale complements the company s retail operations by allowing the company to purchase in larger volumes at more favorable pricing and to generate additional net sales with relatively small incremental increases in operating expenses 
comparable stores net sales have improved since the company s initial public offering in may the company believes that this trend has resulted in part from its expansion strategies 
in the past  as part of its strategy to expand retail operations  the company has at times opened larger new stores in close proximity to existing stores where the company determined that the trade area could support a larger store 
in some of these situations  the company retained its existing store so long as it continued to contribute store level operating income 
while this strategy was designed to increase revenues and store level operating income  it has had a negative impact on comparable store net sales as some customers migrated from the existing store to the larger new store 
the company believes that this strategy has impacted its historical comparable sales growth 
during the three years in the period from january  to december   average net sales per estimated saleable square foot computed on cents only stores open for a full year declined from per square foot to per square foot 
this trend reflects the company s determination to target larger locations for new store development 
existing stores average approximately  gross square feet 
since january   the company has opened new stores including one relocation in  two in and four in that average over  gross square feet 
the company currently targets new store locations between  and  gross feet 
although it is the company s experience that larger stores generally have lower average net sales per square foot than smaller stores  larger stores generally achieve higher average annual store revenues and operating income 
cents only stores has increased its net sales  operating income and net income in each of the last five years 
in it had net sales of million  operating income of million and income from continuing operations of million before a charge of million from the discontinued operation  representing a  and increase over  respectively 
from through  the company had a compounded annual growth rate in net sales  operating income and net income of  and  respectively 
recent developments universal international 
the company has determined it would be in its best interest  and that of its shareholders  to focus its efforts on increasing the growth rate of cents only stores  which over the past five years has yielded operating margins averaging 
in conjunction with this revised growth strategy  the company has decided to sell its universal subsidiary 
universal operates a multi price point variety chain  with stores located in the midwest  texas and upstate new york  under the trade names only deals and odd s n end s 
among other factors which were considered in making this decision was the company s successful opening of its first cents only stores outside the state of california in las vegas nevada 
the success of the las vegas  nevada store helps to prove that the cents only stores concept is portable to areas outside the state of california 
as a result  the company will focus greater management resources to expand more rapidly in nevada and into arizona 
universal incurred an operating loss of million the fourth quarter of versus a marginal profit of million in universal s business is seasonal and historically the fourth quarter was relied upon to achieve all of its income goals 
in the fourth quarter universal was unable to achieve historical gross margin goals and sustained inventory markdowns in efforts to generate sales volume 
universal also incurred additional advertising and distribution costs as compared to the company s plan for the stores located in texas  new york and areas outside the local distribution point of minneapolis  minnesota 
the company has adopted a definitive plan to sell universal 
it plans to engage an investment banking firm to evaluate and identify potential buyers for the universal business 
the company expects to sell universal to a strategic buyer within one year 
the company has million of net assets of discontinued business at december  the value of universal s net assets at december  includes million in inventory  net fixed assets of million  million of other assets offset by million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities

as a result of the items discussed above  net income increased million  or  from million in to million in net income as a percentage of net sales was in and in liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has funded its operations principally from cash provided by operations  and has not generally relied upon external sources of financing 
the company s capital requirement results primarily from purchases of inventory  expenditures related to new store openings and working capital requirements for new and existing stores 
the company takes advantage of close out and other special situation opportunities  which frequently result in large volume purchases  and as a consequence  its cash requirements are not constant or predictable during the year and can be affected by the timing and size of its purchases 
during  and  net cash provided by operations was million  million and million  respectively

the company does not maintain any credit facilities with any bank 
however  the company maintains a surety bond of approximately million for self insured workers compensation 
the company leases its  square foot single level warehouse and distribution facility under a lease accounted for as a capital lease 
the lease requires monthly payments of  and accrues interest at an annual rate of 
at the lease expiration in december  the company has the option to purchase the facility for million 
the company currently intends to exercise the option at the end of the lease 
if the company does not exercise the purchase option  the company will be subject to a million penalty 
the company plans to open new cents only stores at a targeted annual rate of 
the average investment per new store opened in  including leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  inventory and pre opening expenses  was approximately  pre opening expenses are not capitalized by the company 
the company s cash needs for new store openings are expected to total approximately million in the company s total planned expenditures for for additions to fixtures and leasehold improvements of existing stores as well as for distribution expansion and replacement will be approximately million 
the company believes that its total capital expenditure requirements including new store openings will increase to million in capital expenditures in are currently expected to be incurred primarily for new store openings  improvements to existing stores and system and general corporate infrastructure 
the company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet operating needs and capital spending requirements for at least the next twelve months 
on january  the company acquired all of the remaining outstanding minority shares of universal for million 
this million minority interest acquisition cost for universal has been considered in the estimated net realizable value of the net assets of the discontinued business as of december  in addition  the company acquired a distribution facility for universal for million on march  the lease on universal s current distribution facility will expire in july the company believes the acquisition of the distribution facility was a very favorable purchase price relative to current market values 
it is currently planned that this facility will be either leased to the prospective buyer of universal or will be able to be resold for a gain 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience some seasonal fluctuation in its net sales  operating income and net income 
the highest sales periods for the company are the christmas and halloween seasons 
a greater amount of the company s net sales and operating and net income is generally realized during the fourth quarter 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of certain holidays eg  easter and the timing of new store openings and the merchandise mix 
further  the operations of universal are even more dependent upon results in the fourth quarter 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited results of operations for each quarter during and and such information as a percentage of net sales 
the unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial data shown

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement was amended by sfas no 
which defers the effective date to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
is effective for the company s first quarter in the year and is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position 
risk factors inflation the company s ability to provide quality merchandise at the cents price point is subject to certain economic factors  which are beyond the company s control  including inflation 
inflation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations  especially given the constraints on the company to pass on any incremental costs due to price increases or other factors 
the company believes that it will be able to respond to ordinary price increases resulting from inflationary pressures by adjusting the number of items sold at the single price point eg  two items for cents instead of three items for cents and by changing its selection of merchandise 
nevertheless  a sustained trend of significantly increased inflationary pressure could require the company to abandon its single price point of cents per item  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see also we are vulnerable to uncertain economic factor and changes in minimum wage for a discussion of additional risks attendant to inflationary conditions 
we depend on new store openings for future growth our operating results depend largely on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully and to manage a larger business profitably 
in  and  we opened ten  thirteen and eighteen of our cents only stores  respectively ten  eleven and fourteen stores  respectively  net of relocated stores 
from january  through march   we opened seven cents only stores and we expect to open at least thirteen cents only stores in southern california and nevada during the remainder of the year 
we plan to open new stores over the next several years at a rate of approximately per year 
our strategy depends on many factors  including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for our new stores  negotiate leases with acceptable terms  refurbish stores  appropriately upgrade our financial and management information systems and controls and manage our operating expenses 
in addition  we must be able to continue to hire  train  motivate and retain competent managers and store personnel 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our expansion goals 
any failure by us to achieve our expansion goals on a timely basis  obtain acceptance in markets in which we currently have limited or no presence  attract and retain management and other qualified personnel  appropriately upgrade our financial and management information systems and control or manage operating expenses could adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also cannot assure you that when we open new stores  we will improve our results of operations 
a variety of factors  including store location  store size  rental terms  the level of store sales and the level of initial advertising influence if and when a store becomes profitable 
assuming that our planned expansion occurs as anticipated  our store base will include a relatively high proportion of stores with relatively short operating histories 
we cannot assure you that our new stores will achieve the sales per saleable square foot and store level operating margins currently achieved at our existing stores 
if our new stores on average fail to achieve these results  our planned expansion could produce a decrease in our overall sales per saleable square foot and store level operating margins 
increases in the level of advertising and pre opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores could also contribute to a decrease in our operating margins 
finally  the opening of new stores in existing markets has in the past and may in the future reduce retail sales of existing stores in those markets  negatively affecting comparable store sales 
our operations are mainly concentrated in southern california all but one of our cents only stores are currently located in southern california 
the company currently has one store in las vegas  nevada and plans to open an additional store in las vegas on march  in addition  our year retail expansion plans includes new stores in these regions and thereafter also in arizona 
as a result  our results of operations and financial condition depend upon trends in the southern california economy 
for example  this region experienced an economic recession in the early s 
although this recession had no material effect on our business  between and most california counties  particularly los angeles  recorded a significant decline in retail spending 
recovery in these retail markets has continued from through however  this trend may not continue and retail spending could decline in the future 
in addition  southern california historically has been vulnerable to certain natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods and civil disturbance 
at times  these events have disrupted the local economy 
these events could also pose physical risks to our properties 
although we maintain standard property and business interruption insurance  we do not have earthquake insurance on our properties 
we could experience disruptions in receiving and distribution our success depends upon whether our receiving and shipment schedules are organized and well managed 
as we continue to grow  we may face unexpected demands on our warehouse operations that could cause delays in delivery of merchandise to or from our warehouses to our stores 
a fire  earthquake or other disaster at our warehouses could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly because much of our merchandise consists of close outs and other irreplaceable products 
although we maintain standard property and business interruption insurance  we do not have earthquake insurance on our properties 
although we try to limit our risk of exposure to potential product liability claims  we do not know if the limitations in our agreements are enforceable 
we maintain insurance covering damage from use of our products 
if any product liability claim is successful and large enough  our business could suffer 
we depend upon our relationships with our suppliers and the availability of close out and special situation merchandise our success depends in large part on our ability to locate and purchase quality close out and special situation merchandise at attractive prices 
this helps us maintain a mix of name brand and other merchandise at the cents price point 
we cannot be certain that such merchandise will continue to be available in the future 
further  we may not be able to find and purchase merchandise in quantities necessary to accommodate our growth 
additionally  our suppliers sometimes restrict the advertising  promotion and method of distribution of their merchandise 
these restrictions in turn may make it more difficult for us to quickly sell these items from our inventory 
although we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good  we do not have long term agreements with any supplier 
as a result  we must continuously seek out buying opportunities from our existing suppliers and from new sources 
we compete for these opportunities with other wholesalers and retailers  discount and deep discount chains  mass merchandisers  food markets  drug chains  club stores and various privately held companies and individuals 
although we do not depend on any single supplier or group of suppliers and believe we can successfully compete in seeking out new suppliers  a disruption in the availability of merchandise at attractive prices could impair our business 
we purchase in large volumes and our inventory is highly concentrated to obtain inventory at attractive prices  we take advantage of large volume purchases  close outs and other special situations 
as a result  our inventory levels are generally higher than other discount retailers 
at december   and  we recorded net inventory of million  million and million  respectively 
we periodically review the net realizable value of our inventory and make adjustments to its carrying value when appropriate 
the current carrying value of our inventory reflects our belief that we will realize the net values recorded on our balance sheet 
however  we may not be able to do so 
if we sell large portions of our inventory at amounts less than their carrying value or if we write down a significant part of our inventory  our cost of sales  gross profits  operating income and net income could suffer greatly during the period in which such event or events occur 
we face strong competition we compete in both the acquisition of inventory and sale of merchandise with other wholesalers  discount and deep discount stores  single price point merchandisers  mass merchandisers  food markets  drug chains  club stores and other retailers 
our industry competitors also include many privately held companies and individuals 
at times  these competitors are also customers of our bargain wholesale division 
in the future  new companies may also enter the deep discount retail industry 
additionally  we currently face increasing competition for the purchase of quality close out and other special situation merchandise 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and buying power than us 
our capability to compete will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully purchase and resell merchandise at lower prices than our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
we are vulnerable to uncertain economic factors and changes in the minimum wage our ability to provide quality merchandise at our cents price point could be hindered by certain economic factors beyond our control  including but not limited to increases in inflation  increases in operating costs  increases in employee health care costs  increases in prevailing wage levels  and decreases in consumer confidence levels 
as a result  increases in federal and state minimum wage requirements significantly affect our business 
in california  the minimum wage increased 
in march from to per hour  in september from to per hour  in march to per hour 
the federal minimum wage increased in september to per hour 
congress has proposed a bill to increase the minimum wage to per hour beginning september   and per hour beginning september   with later adjustments to reflect increases in the consumer price index 
since we provide consumers with merchandise at a cents price point  we typically cannot pass on to them any incremental costs 
as a result  significant increases in the minimum wage requirements could impair our business 
we face risks associated with international sales and purchases although international sales historically have not been important to our consolidated net sales  they have contributed to growth in bargain wholesale s net sales 
in addition  some of the inventory we purchase is manufactured outside the united states 
there are many risks associated with doing business internationally 
our international transactions may be subject to risks such as political instability  currency fluctuations  exchange rate controls  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates 
the united states and other countries have also proposed various forms of protectionist trade legislation 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade policies could lead to fewer purchases of our products and could adversely affect our international operations 
we could encounter risks related to transactions with our affiliates we currently lease of our  cents only stores and a parking lot for one of these stores from certain members of the gold family and their affiliates 
our annual rental expense for these facilities totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that our lease terms are just as favorable to us as they would be for an unrelated party 
under our current policy  we enter into real estate transactions with our affiliates only for the renewal or modification of existing leases and on occasions where we determine that such transactions are in our best interests 
moreover  the independent members of our board of directors must unanimously approve all real estate transactions between us and our affiliates 
they must also determine that such transactions are equivalent to a negotiated arm s length transaction with a third party 
we cannot guarantee that we will reach agreements with the gold family on renewal terms for the properties we currently lease from them 
also  even if we agree to such terms  we cannot be certain that our independent directors will approve them 
if we fail to renew one of these leases  we could be forced to relocate or close the leased store 
any relocations or closures we experience will be costly and could adversely affect our business 
we rely heavily on our management team our success depends substantially on david gold  our chief executive officer 
we also rely on the continued service of our executive officers and other key management  particularly helen pipkin  our senior vice president of wholesale operations 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our executive officers and we do not maintain key person life insurance on them 
as we continue to grow  our success will depend on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified candidates 
our operating results may fluctuate and may be affected by seasonal buying patterns historically  our highest net sales and operating income have occurred during the fourth quarter  which includes the christmas and halloween selling seasons 
during and  we generated approximately and  respectively  of our net sales and approximately and  respectively  of our operating income during the fourth quarter 
accordingly  any decrease in net sales during the fourth quarter could reduce our profitability and impair our results of operations for the entire year 
in addition to seasonality  many other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
the factors include the number and timing of sales contributed to new stores  the level of advertising and pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the integration of new stores into our operations  general economic health of the deep discount retail industry  changes in the mix of products sold  unexpected increases in shipping costs  ability to successfully manage our inventory levels  changes in our personnel  fluctuations in the amount of consumer spending  and the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the growth of our business 
we are subject to environmental regulations under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  current or previous owners or occupants of property may become liable for the costs of removing any hazardous substances found on the property 
these laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we currently lease all but eight of our stores  as well as our warehouse and distribution facility where our executive offices are located 
we have the option to purchase our warehouse and distribution facility in december  which we plan to do 
however  in the future we may be required to incur substantial costs for preventive or remedial measures associated with the presence of hazardous materials 
in addition  we operate one underground diesel storage tank and one above ground propane storage tank at our warehouse 
although we have not been notified of  and are not aware of  any current environmental liability  claim or non compliance  we could incur costs in the future related to our leased properties and our storage tanks 
in the ordinary course of our business  we sometimes handle or dispose of commonplace household products that are classified as hazardous materials under various environmental laws and regulations 
we have adopted policies regarding the handling and disposal of these products  and we train our employees on how to handle and dispose of them 
we cannot assure you that our policies and training will successfully help us avoid potential violations of these environmental laws and regulations in the future 
anti takeover effect  we are controlled by our existing shareholders in addition to some governing provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  we are also subject to certain california laws and regulations which could delay  discourage or prevent others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change in our control  even if such actions would benefit our shareholders and us 
in addition  david gold  our chairman and chief executive officer  and members of his immediate family and certain of their affiliates beneficially own  shares of our voting stock 
as a result  they have the ability to control all matters requiring the vote of our shareholders  including the election of our directors and most of our corporate actions 
they can also control our policies and prevent a change in our control 
this could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
our stock price could fluctuate widely the market price of our common stock has risen substantially since our initial public offering on may  trading prices for our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to many factors  including the depth of the market for our common stock  changes in expectations of our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  variations in our operating results  conditions or trends in our industry or in the industries of any of our significant clients  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our common stock 
year the company had no interruption of its business process as a result of year computer issues or yk related equipment malfunctions 
the company successfully implemented its yk systems plan and spent approximately million to upgrade certain equipment and cash registers at the universal retail stores to replace non compliant yk equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk for its investments in marketable securities 
at december   the company had  in marketable securities maturing at various dates through october the company s investments are comprised primarily of investment grade federal and municipal bonds and commercial paper 
the company generally holds investments until maturity
