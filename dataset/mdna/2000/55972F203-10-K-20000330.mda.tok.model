this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment by management of the company 
in april  the company purchased the permian basin properties from burlington for a net purchase price of million after purchase price adjustments of million 
these properties consisted of approximately  producing oil and gas wells and associated acreage in west texas and southeast new mexico 
this acquisition substantially increased the company s cash flow and inventory of exploitation  development and exploration opportunities 
on january   the company commenced a cash purchase offer for units of tel offshore trust 
previous to the offer  the company owned  units representing of the units outstanding 
as amended  the offer was to purchase between forty percent and sixty percent of the trust s outstanding units at per unit 
on march   the company purchased  units for million pursuant to the tender offer and  together with the units it previously owned  became the owner of approximately of the total number of units outstanding for an aggregate consideration of million 
on december   the company through its newly formed owned subsidiary  bluebird  acquired from spirit energy spirit natural gas reserves and associated assets in producing fields located in oklahoma and texas 
the net purchase price was approximately million after certain purchase price adjustments  including preferential rights exercised by third parties and other customary adjustments 
as part of the capitalization of bluebird  the company contributed  units of tel offshore trust 
bluebird  as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined under certain credit agreements  is neither a guarantor of the company s senior notes due nor can it be included in determining compliance with certain financial covenants under the company s credit agreements 
to finance the spirit acquisition  bluebird borrowed million under a bridge loan facility with several banks 
the bridge loan was replaced on june  with permanent financing from banks providing for a revolving credit facility of million with an initial borrowing base of million  due june  with interest rates based upon either libor or base rate prime 
the loan is non recourse to the company 
in addition to retiring the bridge loan  a portion of the proceeds from the permanent financing was used to finance the acquisition of properties from vastar resources  inc vastar discussed below 
on february   the company sold million of its convertible preferred stock in a private placement 
the preferred stock has a liquidation value of million and is convertible into the company s common stock at per share 
dividends on the preferred stock are payable in cash at the rate of per annum and are cumulative 
the company used the net proceeds from the transaction  approximately million  to repay senior bank indebtedness 
on june   the company acquired oil and gas reserves and related assets from vastar for a total purchase price of million after purchase price adjustments 
the effective date of the acquisition was april  the acquisition included vastar s interest in wells  a gas processing plant and two gas gathering systems located in the states of texas  oklahoma and arkansas 
on december   the company acquired ownership interest in the madill gas processing plant and associated gathering system from dynegy midstream services  lp  a wholly owned subsidiary of dynegy  inc this modern cryogenic plant includes  horsepower of high speed compression and has gas processing capacity of approximately  mcf d 
the facilities are located in marshall and bryan counties  oklahoma 
the effective date of the acquisition was november  the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes exceed the sec pv of estimated future net cash flow from proved reserves of oil and gas  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
due primarily to the severe decline in world crude oil and natural gas prices experienced in  the company recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of million at december  pursuant to the ceiling limitation required by the full cost method of accounting  using certain improvements in pricing experienced after the end of the period 
without the benefit of improvements in pricing subsequent to december   the company would have incurred an impairment of million 
the company s sec pv property valuation at december  exceeded the capitalized cost at that date 
significant downward revisions of quantity estimates or declines in oil and gas prices which are not offset by other factors could possibly result in write down for impairment of oil and gas properties in the future

the company is not contractually obligated to proceed with any of its budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within the company s control or ability to forecast  including drilling results and changes in oil and gas prices 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
on june   the company s borrowing base under its revolving credit line was reduced from million to million as a result of the december  reserve engineering report 
based upon the company s anticipated level of operations  the company believes that cash flow from operations together with the availability under the credit facility approximately million available as of december  will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled interest and dividend payments for the foreseeable future

when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with the company s growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which may be submitted by the company from time to time will be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  the company may require additional financing in connection therewith 
inflation and changes in prices during  the company experienced an increase in prices for oil and for natural gas compared to the previous year 
the results of operations and cash flow of the company have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should the company experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  it would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
periodically the company enters into futures  options  and swap contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil and gas prices 
it is the policy of the company not to enter into any such arrangements which exceed of the company s oil and gas production during the next months 
the company markets oil and gas for its own account  which exposes the company to the attendant commodities risk 
a substantial portion of the company s gas production is currently sold to ngts  llc or end users either on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
the company normally sells its oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers

year compliance beginning in  the company was involved in a program to be year ready 
the program involved reviews of major business  financial and other information systems  including equipment with embedded microprocessors  development of specific plans for modification or replacement of date sensitive software or microprocessors  execution of such plans and the testing of such systems to ensure their year readiness 
included within the scope of the program were contacts with key suppliers and customers to determine their year readiness in order to ensure a steady flow of goods and services to the company and continuity with respect to customer service 
as a result of this program  there were no significant occurrences of year related failures 
additionally  the company does not anticipate that any significant subsequent events will occur

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk energy swap agreements 
the company engages in futures contracts with certain of its production through various contracts swap agreements 
the company considers these contracts to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in oil and gas sales 
in order to consider these contracts as hedges  i the company must designate the contract as a hedge of future production and ii the contract must reduce the company s exposure to the risk of changes in prices 
changes in the market value of contracts treated as hedges are not recognized in income until the hedged item is also recognized in income 
if the above criteria are not met  the company will record the market value of the contract at the end of the month and recognize a related gain or loss 
proceeds received or paid relating to terminated contracts or contracts that have been sold are amortized over the original contract period and reflected in oil and gas sales 
the company enters into hedging activities in order to secure an acceptable future price relating to a portion of future production 
the primary objective of these activities is to protect against decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the swap agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet oil and the inside ferc natural gas index price posting index 
the company has contracts which contain specific contracted prices swaps that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract prices and the specified index prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the index exceeds the contract price  the company pays the spread  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the index price the company receives the spread 
in addition  the company has combined contracts which have agreed upon price floors and ceilings costless collars 
to the extent the index price exceeds the contract ceiling  the company pays the spread between the ceiling and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the contract floor exceeds the index  the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to related contract volumes  the company has a credit risk in the event of nonperformance of the counterparty to the agreement
