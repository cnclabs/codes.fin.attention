during the fiscal year ended february  fy  the company reported net loss applicable to common shareholders of  or per share basic and diluted 
revenues total revenues of  for fy were higher than total revenues for fy the increase was due to a  improvement in investment income loss and other income  and a increase in net sales from the jm ney company jm ney 
during fy  jm ney s sales of  represent an increase of  over the sales levels reached in fy such sales increase primarily reflected the pass through effect of increased selling prices for products containing palladium as a result of higher market prices for this particular precious metal 
during fy  the average market value for palladium was approximately per troy ounce  compared to approximately per troy ounce during fy during each of the last three years  the market price for palladium has been both volatile and generally increasing 
during fy  the products sold by jm ney contained approximately  troy ounces of palladium as compared to approximately  ounces shipped in products for fy fabrication sales during fy to jm ney s former dental affiliate were  lower than fy as a result of the expiration of an exclusive manufacturing agreement entered into in connection with the november sale of the net assets of the former dental segment 
such fabrication sales generally involve much lower material components of cost of sales  and thus have a higher proportional contribution to absorbing fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
activities which comprise investment income loss and other income produced a net gain of  during fy  as compared to a net loss of  which was incurred during fy  as follows in thousands fy fy net loss from domestic investment portfolio net gain loss from russian and eastern european portfolio  realized gain write down of long term russian investments  interest and dividends rental income ultrasonic royalty revenue other  net the domestic portfolio loss in fy is comprised of net realized losses of  from the company s portfolio of savings bank stocks   of realized gains from jm ney s purchase and sale of two securities 
the sale of investments in a polish based bank  appreciation in the value of a portfolio of ukrainian securities  and the increase in value of a russian equity fund contributed to the gains in the russian and eastern european portfolio 
the company sold its investment in vsmpo  which resulted in the realization of a gain from the prior year s recorded value 
during fy  the market value for russian securities decreased significantly resulting in an unrealized decline of in the company s portfolio of russian  ukrainian and polish trading investments 
in addition  a jm ney investment in a russian bond fund declined in value by approximately  or of the original investment 
the company also wrote down the value of its long term investments in ias and vsmpo due to the russian market conditions  and the perceived impact on the company s ability to realize value from these investments in the near term 
cost of sales cost of sales during fy totaled  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fy the decline in gross margins from to was the result of the previously noted higher palladium prices which were passed through to customers in the form of higher selling prices without a commensurate margin markup 
gross margins from sales totaled  which is  less than the gross margins reported for the prior year 
this decrease of  consisted of  of losses due to the combination of higher precious metal acquisition prices and increased pension costs compared to prior year  net of an increase in margins from operations of  due to rapidly escalating palladium prices during the final few weeks and days of fy  jm ney s metals management strategies were re focused with the aim of controlling cash flow 
accordingly  cost of sales includes two components that management associates with metals management rather than operating performance a lifo gain of million resulting from reductions in inventory quantities which were recorded at prices substantially less than the current prevailing prices as required by the lifo method of accounting  and additional charges to cost of sales totaling million consisting of managed changes in the lifo reserve from higher current precious metal prices and expenses relating to the precious metals hedging program 
in fy  jm ney recognized  of lifo gains from a decrease in its palladium inventory levels 
for fy  jm ney would have recognized a net gain of  from these activities  except that a net expense of approximately  was created during the during the last week of the fiscal year when  ounces of palladium consignment borrowings were paid down and ounces of platinum were purchased  each by using the deferred payment metal loan feature of the revolving credit agreement jm ney has with its primary lender 
the value of such deferred payment obligations varies with the market price of the underlying metals on which the loan is based  and is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet 
these transactions lowered the amount of the lifo gains that would have otherwise been recognized by approximately  and created an additional expense of  based upon the market price for the metals in relation to the standard price of the metals as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
these transactions did not change jm ney s net economic exposure to price fluctuations in these metals  so this increased expense is indirectly reflected within the increased lifo reserve at february  cost of sales was also affected in fy by  of pension expense  as compared to pension income of  that was recorded for fy this negative swing of  or in margin rate  was caused by actuarial assumption changes and investment losses incurred by the company s overfunded defined benefit plan 
during fy  sales of precious metal materials in the form of wire  strip and rod  represented of sales  as compared to for fy material products generally have lower average gross margins  due to the commodity nature of this product class  versus highly engineered parts and components  which involve more value added processing and higher gross billing margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  during fy represents a increase from the costs of  incurred in the prior fiscal year 
corporate level costs increased primarily as a result of  of expenses incurred to support the negotiation of the joint venture arrangement with moscow telecommunications company comcor and moscow broadband  of which the company is currently a shareholder  and related travel cost 
in addition  jm ney s expenses increased by approximately  much of which was relating to higher sales and marketing costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales in fy the increase was attributable to effort expended to develop new alloys and expand jm ney s technical competencies in meeting the changing requirements of its target markets  and to approximately  of costs that were formerly allocated to product costs 
interest expense interest expense of  during fy was slightly lower than the  of interest expense incurred during fy jm ney incurred increased interest expense on increased outstandings on its consignments borrowings  which also resulted in higher interest costs due to the increase in both the price and the lease rates for these borrowings 
corporate level interest cost declined primarily as a result of lower average principal outstandings on the subordinated debentures 
income taxes an income tax benefit of  was recorded for fy which represents an effective tax rate of  as compared to an income tax benefit of  for fy  which represents an effective income tax benefit rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to utilization of tax credits

revenues total revenues of  for fy were lower than total revenues from continuing operations reported for the fiscal year ended february  fy 
the decline was due to a  decrease in investment income loss and other income  which was partially offset on a increase in net sales from the jm ney company jm ney 
during fy  jm ney s sales increased by  such sales increase primarily reflected the pass through effect of increased selling prices for products containing palladium as a result of higher market prices for this particular precious metal 
during fy  the average market value for palladium was approximately per troy ounce  compared to approximately per troy ounce during fy during each of the last two years  the market for palladium has been both volatile and generally increasing 
during fy  the products sold by jm ney contained approximately  troy ounces of palladium 
overall sales growth was hampered by i the general motors labor strike  which reduced demand for many of jm ney s products that are sold to the automotive industry  ii the expiration of an exclusive manufacturing contract with the company s former dental segment which resulted in a sales decline of  and iii delays in the implementation of several sales programs to customers who had purchased the required tooling from jm ney but did not request the anticipated level of parts production

this sales mix  and the resultant underabsorption of operating expenses  contributed to lower average gross margins during fy compared to the prior year 
the fy margin decline was somewhat offset through expanded metals purchasing programs that included forward purchases of palladium and sales of put options for the purchase of palladium as a hedge against jm ney s manufacturing requirements 
in addition  jm ney reduced its inventory of palladium by approximately  troy ounces which resulted in a lifo gain of approximately  when measured against the beginning of the fiscal year palladium prices 
pension income component of cost of sales resulted in income of  of income in fy  as compared to  of such income for fy one further element contributing to offsetting narrower margins was a reclassification of approximately  in engineering costs to more properly reflect management s analysis of costs that related to the manufacture of its products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of  during fy represent a modest decline from the costs incurred in the prior fiscal year

interest expense interest expense of  during fy was higher than the  of interest expense incurred during fy most of the increase relates to a full year of interest on a million subordinated note which jm ney issued during the fourth quarter of fy in addition  jm ney incurred increased interest expense on high interest rate palladium leases which served to hedge market risk  primarily attributable to its refining operations

in the prior year  the company had recorded a gain of  on this sale  net of  of income taxes 
preferred dividends during fy  the company incurred  of preferred dividends based upon the revised terms of per share 
during fy  a total of  in dividends and discount accretion were accrued based on former terms under which the preferred dividends were linked to the operating results of jm ney 
liquidity and capital resources at february   consolidated cash and marketable securities totaled  which is a decrease of  or  from february  during fy  the company used the proceeds from the sales of marketable securities and long term investments to make additional investments in moscow broadband  for the purpose of funding the operations of comcor tv  which is a moscow based company that is jointly owned by moscow broadband and comcor

in april  the company borrowed a total of  from its chairman and its president under both secured and unsecured agreements to meet its preferred dividend and interest payment requirements 
during fy  the prices of the precious metals that jm ney utilizes in the alloying and manufacturing of its products again experienced significant volatility 
primarily as a net result of an increase of approximately per ounce of the palladium content of its inventory  jm ney s lifo reserve increased by  net of the liquidation of lifo layers

in june  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be recognized immediately or deferred depending on the use of the derivative and if the derivative is a qualifying hedge 
the effective date of sfas no 
was subsequently delayed and is now effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt sfas no 
by may   as required 
the company is currently assessing the impact of this statement on the company s consolidated financial statements

the company cautions that a number of important factors could cause actual results for fiscal and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to i economic and political developments in russia and eastern europe  ii the ability of comcor tv to successfully implement its business plans  including the build out of the network to access cable tv and internet subscribers  and its ability to sign up such subscribers at or near planned levels  iii changes in technology that would affect jm ney s products  or affect the value of the ultrasonic cleaning technology on which contingent consideration is based  iv acceptance of new product developments and v the price and volatility of precious metals 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes which could adversely affect its operating results in one or more fiscal quarters 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
year over the past two years  the company formalized and implemented a comprehensive plan to address the year problem which stems primarily from two digit date storage that does not facilitate proper calculations of date sensitive information when the year changed to the company expended approximately  in this process  including approximately  during the fiscal year ended february  these amounts exclude the cost of system upgrades that were required to be made to meet other operational requirements 
no material problems resulting from year issues occurred at or subsequent to january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company and jm ney are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  primarily those of precious metals  from changes in interest rates  and from factors that affect equity investment in russia and the ukraine 
foreign investment risk the company has a trading portfolio of russian and ukraine investments with a net reported value at february  of  and a longer term indirect investment in comcor tv  a russian company  through its investment in moscow broadband with a reported value of  in addition  jm ney has an investment in a russian bond fund with a reported value of  the realizable value of these investments  particularly russian components  is subject to currency fluctuations  illiquid markets and political risks 
the company has no derivative financials instruments to hedge the risks associated with these investments 
commodity price risk jm ney utilizes significant amounts of precious metals in the products it manufactures and sells 
significant increases in the market value of these metals  palladium  gold and platinum  in particular  may affect the demand for its products 
jm ney generally adjusts the selling prices of its products if market prices change significantly  or it hedges fixed selling price programs 
accordingly  while a change in precious metals prices may affect cost of sales  such impact is generally met with an approximately equivalent charge in sales  so that the impact on earnings is minimal or not present 
significant fluctuations and volatility in precious metal price creates risk that purchases of precious metals may not be efficiently coordinated with sales 
while jm ney believes it has the programs in place to limit this risk  there can be no assurance that volatility in price does not result in unintended profits or losses 
also  while increases or decreases in precious metal prices affect the economic value of jm ney s inventory  such changes are generally reflected with a corresponding change in the lifo reserve and do not affect the net reported value of its inventory 
as more fully discussed later  changes in the prices of commodities being borrowed under consignment lease or deferred payment borrowing arrangements can significantly affect jm ney s interest costs  as interest on these arrangements is charged based upon the market value of the underlying metal and the lease rate for that metal 
lease rates for palladium have fluctuated significantly in each of the last three fiscal years 
interest rate risk jm ney has a revolving line of credit which bears interest at floating rates as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
neither the company nor jm ney hedges its interest rate risk  including the note associated with precious metal consignment arrangements which are tied to precious metal leasing 
based upon jm ney s year end balances  a change in interest rates would affect its interest cost of its short term cash borrowings by approximately  however  during most of fy  jm ney did not have outstanding cash borrowings on its revolving line of credit  thus a change in interest rates would have a minimal impact on reported interest expense 
most of jm ney s usage of its credit line is in the form of consignment or deferred payment borrowings of precious metals  some of which hedge precious metals inventory represented by scrap metal of its refining operations 
based upon year end balances and metals prices  a change in precious metal leasing rates would affect jm ney s interest cost by approximately  such leasing costs are also affected by changes in the market prices for the precious metals being leased 
during fy the leasing rates and market prices for palladium fluctuated significantly 
leasing costs ranged from a high of per annum to a low of  with an unweighted average of approximately 
market prices for palladium contracts ranged from per troy ounce to per troy ounce 
as a result  daily lease costs for palladium ranged from approximately per ounce to approximately per ounce 
at february   jm ney had a total of  ounces of palladium  ounces of platinum  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver borrowed under consignment or deferred pricing contracts 
in addition  it had an outstanding forward sale of  ounces of palladium  which also has an implied interest factor built into the pricing 
during fy  jm ney reduced certain of its precious metal inventory levels 
at february   some of this reduction was replenished  resulting in metals losses totaling approximately  much of this loss is included in the increased lifo reserve and was the result of metals management and cash flow strategies implemented 
in addition  declines in the value of liabilities under deferred pricing loans  and the equity value of forward sale contracts resulted in income of approximately  being recognized in the first two months of fy also  at february   j m ney had open contracts for put options and call options which it had sold to hedge certain fiscal year end metal positions 
these contracts expired out of the money  enabling jm ney to recognize an additional  of income in fy the company passed a portion of these metal fluctuations and market sensitive lease costs to its refining customers  in the form of charges that are included in other income 
however  during fy the net impact of such fluctuations was less significant to the company s consolidated results of operations than it was during fy due to the interest risk of financing and managing precious metals inventory  there can be no assurance that changes in either or both precious metals prices or leasing rates will not continue to have a material affect on future results of operations
