item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
certain of the matters discussed herein and elsewhere in this form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of interpool to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
general the company generates revenues through leasing transportation equipment  primarily dry freight standard containers and container chassis 
most of the company s revenues are derived from payments under operating leases and income earned under finance leases  under which the lessee has the right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
in may  the company s microtech subsidiary acquired a interest in personal computer rentals inc pcr  a nationwide lessor of computers and related equipment 
revenue derived from an operating lease generally consists of the total lease payment from the customer 
in  and  revenues derived from operating leases were million of revenues  million of revenues  and million of revenues  respectively 
revenue derived from a direct finance lease consists only of income recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method 
the principal component of the direct finance lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct finance lease 
in  and  total payments from direct finance leases were million  million and million  respectively 
the revenue component of total lease payments totaled million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the revenue component of total lease payments is a result of the reduction in finance lease revenues of million as a result of the securitized lease receivables 
the company s mix of operating and direct finance leases is a function of customer preference and demand and the company s success in meeting those customer requirements 
during the initial two years of either an operating lease or a direct finance lease  the contribution to the company s earnings before interest and taxes is very similar 
in subsequent periods  however  the operating lease will generally be more profitable than a direct finance lease  primarily due to the return of principal inherent in a direct finance lease 
however  after the long term portion and any renewal of an operating lease expires  the operating lease will have redeployment costs and related risks which are avoided under a direct finance lease 
the company conducts business with shipping line customers throughout the world and is thus subject to the risks of operating in disparate political and economic conditions 
offsetting this risk is the worldwide nature of the shipping business and the ability of the company s shipping line customers to shift their operations from areas of unfavorable political and or economic conditions to more promising areas 
substantially all of the company s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
in addition  the company s container purchases are paid for in us dollars 
the company believes these factors substantially mitigate foreign currency rate risks 
certain of the shipping lines to which the company leases containers are entities domiciled in several asian countries 
in addition  many of the company s customers are substantially dependent upon shipments of goods exported from asia 
economic disruption  political instability or military disturbances in these areas of the world could adversely affect the company 
although the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its business as a result of the recent financial conditions in certain asian markets  there can be no assurance that financial turmoil in one or more of the asian markets would not adversely affect the company s business 
the company s container leasing operations are conducted through interpool limited  a barbados corporation 
the company s effective tax rate benefits substantially from the application of an income tax convention  pursuant to which the profits of interpool limited from container leasing operations are exempt from federal taxation in the united states 
such profits are subject to barbados tax at rates which are significantly lower than the applicable rates in the united states 
see united states federal income tax 
the company s chassis leasing operations are conducted primarily through trac lease 
certain other united states equipment leasing activities are conducted through interpool itself

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedge item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting

the company does not use leverage swaps and does not use leverage in any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
united states federal income tax the company is subject to federal and state income taxes as a subchapter c corporation under the internal revenue code the code 
the company  trac lease  inc and other united states subsidiaries file a consolidated united states federal income tax return 
this consolidated group is liable for federal income taxes on its worldwide income 
personal holding company issues 
if the company or any of its subsidiaries were classified as a personal holding company  such corporation s undistributed personal holding company income would be subject to a federal income tax of in addition to its regular federal income tax liability 
the federal income tax laws have two requirements for classifying a company as a personal holding company 
the company and its subsidiaries currently satisfy the first requirement  the ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock by five or fewer individuals 
whether or not the company or any of its subsidiaries satisfies the second requirement  that at least of such corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income constitutes personal holding company income  will depend upon such corporation s income mix 
based upon current management projections  interpool will be considered a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes for and possibly in subsequent years 
if interpool or any of its subsidiaries is classified as a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes  in addition to its regular federal income tax liability  interpool s or such subsidiary s undistributed personal holding company income generally taxable income with certain adjustments  including a deduction for federal income taxes and dividends paid would be subject to a personal holding company tax of 
management anticipates that for interpool s current level of dividends will be sufficient to avoid having any undistributed personal holding company income  and thus does not anticipate that there will be any personal holding company tax imposed for there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not at some point in the future become liable for such personal holding company tax 
furthermore  the company may at some point in the future elect to increase the dividend rate on its common stock in order to avoid such tax 
the company has incurred certain losses from leasing activities that are characterized for tax purposes as suspended passive losses 
these losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset income from future leasing activities 
as of december  such suspended passive losses totaled approximately million 
trac lease 
trac lease has approximately million of net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes  which may be used only to offset the income of trac lease and  if not utilized  will expire between and the use of substantially all these loss carry forwards is subject to a number of limitations under federal tax laws 
interpool limited 
under certain circumstances  the company may be liable for united states federal income taxes on earnings of interpool limited and any other foreign subsidiaries of the company  whether or not such earnings are distributed to the company 
this would occur if interpool limited realized subpart f income as defined in the code  if it were deemed to be a foreign personal holding company or a passive foreign investment company  or if it were to have an increase in earnings invested in united states property 
subpart f income includes foreign personal holding company income  such as dividends  interest and rents 
although a substantial portion of interpool limited s income consists of rents from container leasing activities  the company believes that such rents are not subpart f income because they are derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and received from unrelated persons 
however  interpool limited has received some dividend and interest income in past years  which was taxed as subpart f income 
if interpool limited were treated as a foreign personal holding company for any year  the company would be taxed on the amount the company would have received if interpool limited had distributed all its income to the company as a dividend 
one of the conditions for treating a foreign subsidiary as a foreign personal holding company is that a minimum of of the foreign subsidiary s gross income must be foreign personal holding company income 
foreign personal holding company income does not include rental income that constitutes at least of the subsidiary s gross income 
because the company expects that rental income will constitute at least of interpool limited s gross income  the company does not anticipate that interpool limited will be deemed a foreign personal holding company 
a foreign corporation such as interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company if or more of its gross income is foreign personal holding company income or the average percentage of assets by value held by such corporation during the taxable year which produce foreign personal holding company income is at least 
the company does not believe that interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company 
if interpool limited were to become a passive foreign investment company  the company would make the election to treat interpool limited as a qualified electing fund with the result that the company would be taxed each year on interpool limited s entire earnings 
the taxpayer relief act of eliminated application of the passive foreign investment company rules to the company for years after a parent company is also subject to taxation when a foreign subsidiary increases the amount of its earnings invested in united states property during any calendar year 
the company does not expect that interpool limited will invest any earnings in united states property 
united states barbados income tax convention 
interpool limited s business is managed and controlled in barbados  it also has a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the tax convention  any profits of interpool limited from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados and not in the united states 
for its taxable years commencing prior to january   interpool limited is entitled to the benefits of the tax convention for each year that more than of the shares of interpool limited are owned  directly or indirectly  by united states citizens or residents the stock ownership test and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents or citizens of the united states the base erosion test 
the company believes that interpool limited passes both of these tests and should continue to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  but there can be no assurance as to such continued eligibility 
if interpool limited ceased to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  a substantial portion of its income would become subject to the united states federal income tax and the branch profits tax 
a protocol to the tax convention has been ratified by the united states and barbados which amends the eligibility provision of the tax convention  making the stock ownership test easier to satisfy and the base erosion test more difficult to satisfy 
the protocol became effective on january  and applies to taxable years of interpool limited commencing on or after that date 
the company believes that interpool limited will continue to satisfy the base erosion test and remain eligible for the benefits of the tax convention after neither the tax convention nor the protocol affords interpool limited any relief from the personal holding company tax or the accumulated earnings tax 
to the extent that interpool limited has united states source income that is personal holding company income or is not needed in its business  interpool limited could be taxed on such income unless such income is distributed to the company as a dividend 
the company expects that interpool limited would distribute any such income to the company 
state and local taxes income taxes 
the company and trac lease are liable for state and local income taxes on their income  and interpool limited is liable for state and local income taxes on its earnings attributable to operations in the united states 
sales tax 
to date  interpool limited and trac lease generally have not paid sales taxes on their leasing revenues to the states in which they conduct business because management has believed such revenues to be exempt from state sales taxes on several grounds  including a long standing interpretation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution that would prohibit the imposition of a tax on cargo containers and chassis used primarily for transportation of goods in interstate commerce or international trade 
recently  itel containers international corp 
itel  a container leasing company  challenged an attempt by the state of tennessee to collect sales tax on itel s proceeds from the leasing of containers delivered in tennessee 
in a ruling by the united states supreme court in february  itel s position was rejected and the court upheld the right of tennessee to impose sales tax on leasing revenues from containers delivered in tennessee 
the company cannot predict the extent to which states other than tennessee will now attempt to collect sales tax on the company s equipment leasing revenues based on this supreme court decision 
under the terms of the company s equipment leases  the company would be entitled to pass any such sales tax on to its lessees 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business 
year during  a working group comprised of senior management and members from potentially affected departments formed to determine the potential scope and costs associated with the onset of the calendar year yk and to insure that the company s systems continued to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
the yk working group met periodically during and  and reported its findings and proposed plans to the company s board of directors 
as a result of the analysis  three of the company s four software systems the fleet management system  the accounting system for accounts payable and general ledger  and the overseas data input program were upgraded or replaced as necessary 
in addition  the telephone pbx systems were replaced as were a number of personal computers of a specific age and model 
recognizing that there may have been additional yk factors related to its dependence on other business partners  including customers  suppliers  and service providers  the company developed a questionnaire requesting yk project information from over business partners  including approximately of all customers and all key suppliers and service providers 
as a result of the company s actions to assure readiness  the much awaited arrival of yk passed without incident 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk to protect its margins on existing transactions 
interest rate risk is the risk of earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the company considers interest rate swap contracts as an integral part of borrowing transactions 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure by entering into amortizing interest rate swap contracts  which coincide with the principal and maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
the company does not use leveraged swaps and does not use leverage in any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
for  a change in interest rates would result in a 
million change in pretax earnings of the company
