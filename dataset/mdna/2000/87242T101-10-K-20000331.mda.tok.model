in the future  we expect periodically to raise funds to acquire equity interests in and establish new partner companies  to support our operations and expand our venture development and venture banking services and to support the operations and growth of our partner companies 
our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of partner companies in which we acquire equity interests and which we establish  the amounts of capital we provide to these companies and the timing of these payments 
our plans and the related capital requirements will be dependent on various factors  such as developments in our markets and the availability of acquisition and entrepreneurial opportunities 
if we are successful in selling additional equity securities  our then existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution 
however  we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  when we need it 
if we require  but are unable to obtain  additional financing in the future on acceptable terms  or at all  we will not be able to continue our business strategy  respond to changing business or economic conditions  withstand adverse operating results or compete effectively  and our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected as a result

our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in marketable securities and million in cash and cash equivalents 
during  cash used in operating activities was million compared to thousand for the nine months ended december  the increase in cash used in operations in reflects the need for working capital required to fund expanding operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing us is the fluctuation in the market value of the securities we acquire in our partner companies and the securities we receive in payment of fees for the venture development and venture banking services we provide to our partner companies 
our partner companies include internet based businesses  established brick and mortar companies implementing an internet based strategy and advanced technology and service companies 
the market prices for our partner companies have been very volatile  experiencing wide fluctuations 
our profitability may be materially and adversely affected by period to period declines in the market values of our partner companies 
see factors affecting our future performance our investments in our partner companies are risky 
historically  we have not generally engaged in hedging transactions to minimize this risk 
we are not subject to market risk associated with risk sensitive institutions because we do not invest in institutions that are not united states institutions and we do not enter into hedging transactions 
historically  we have had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
as we develop our international operations and expand our global coverage of the internet industry  our risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may dramatically increase 
therefore  in the future  we may consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate these risks
