pursuant to this approval  the board of directors of the company approved a reverse split of the common shares in a ratio of one share for every ten shares 
this reverse split was effective on july  foreign currency translation effective january   mexico is no longer considered to be highly inflationary 
however  the company is discontinuing its mexican operations  therefore  the impact of this change had no effect on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation the company reflects price escalations in its quotations to its insulation customers and in its estimation of costs for materials and labor 
for construction contracts based on a cost plus or time and materials basis  the effect of inflation on the company is negligible 
for projects on a fixed price basis  the effect of inflation may result in reduced profit margin or a loss as a result of higher costs to the company as the contracts are completed  however  the majority of the company s contracts are completed within months of their commencement and the company believes that the impact of inflation on such contracts is insignificant 
although inflation has been a significant factor in the mexican economy in general since the devaluation  the company does not anticipate that it will have a material impact on its current or remaining operations 
year issues as previously reported  over the past year the company developed and implemented a plan to address the anticipated impacts of the year problem 
the company also surveyed selected third parties to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
in addition  the company developed contingency plans specifying what the company would do if we or important third parties experienced disruptions to critical business activities as a result of the year problem 
the company s year plan was completed in all material respects prior to the anticipated year failure dates 
as of march   the company has not experienced any materially important business disruptions or system failures as a result of year issues  nor is it aware of any year issues that have impacted its customers  suppliers or other significant third parties to an extent significant to the company 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems that are not year compliant 
as of december   the company incurred total incremental costs of  addressing year issues 
the company does not anticipate that it will incur any more material costs related to the year issue
