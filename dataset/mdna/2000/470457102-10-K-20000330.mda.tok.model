item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
development of new inns 
we believe that attractive opportunities exist for the development of new jameson inns in certain markets in the southeastern united states 
accordingly  we intend to continue developing new jameson inns in targeted communities 
with operating jameson inns in alabama  florida  georgia  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee  we plan to continue developing jameson inns in those states as well as in kentucky  louisiana and virginia 
at december   jameson had a total of jameson inns under development  including jameson inns under construction  and contracts to acquire parcels of land on which additional jameson inns are expected to be constructed during and in addition  we currently have and will consider long term ground leases for our future jameson inn locations 
we believe that jameson has benefitted significantly from its strategy of developing new jameson inns because of the experience and track record of jameson and jameson hospitality in the development  construction and operation of jameson inns 
in evaluating potential development sites  we target communities with strong industrial bases sufficient to attract business travelers 
these communities typically have significant manufacturing facilities  state and federal government installations  or colleges and universities 
we strive to locate our inns in proximity to family style restaurants and targets markets which offer local community events eg annual festivals  fishing tournaments  collegiate football games and other athletic events  graduation ceremonies  etc 
and or tourist and recreational facilities eg lakes  golf courses  hunting areas  etc 
attracting groups and individual discretionary and leisure travelers 
although we have no specific plans to construct new signature inns  we will consider developing new signature inns according to assessment of market demand  cost and other relevant factors 
expansion of existing jameson inns 
we intend to continue to expand existing jameson inns whenever market conditions warrant 
to date  we have expanded jameson inns and  at december   one additional jameson inn was undergoing a room expansion which we expect to open in july since jameson inns built prior to were initially constructed with the office and lobby  swimming pool and fitness center on sites generally large enough for future expansions  the incremental cost per room of expansions is lower than for new inns 
accordingly  jameson has been able to earn attractive returns on its investment by expanding jameson inns in markets with strong room demand 
also  as compared to the development of new inns  expansion of existing jameson inns is a relatively lower risk growth strategy since we have an opportunity to assess local room demand and market trends based on our direct experience in developing and owning the existing hotel 
we expect to employ substantially the same strategy regarding expansion of our currently operating jameson inns 
the sites for new  interior corridor jameson inns  however  and all of the current signature inn sites are fully developed and these properties cannot be expanded 
in these markets  expansions will occur  if at all  through the acquisition of additional sites and the construction of new inns 
jameson hospitality as contractor 
we anticipate that jameson hospitality will act as general contractor for new inns we build and for expansions of existing jameson inns 
each construction contract for a new inn or a group of inns provides for a turnkey price for all work performed under the contract subject to reduction  however  if jameson hospitality s profits as defined in the construction contract exceed 
the contract price excludes the cost of the land and closing costs  but includes the costs of constructing and equipping the inns  including interest charges we incur on the associated construction debt during construction and working with jameson hospitality to staff the inn prior to opening 
an independent architectural firm reviews each construction contract and each is also subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors 
the average price charged by jameson hospitality for the eight new jameson inns opened during and the expansions of jameson inns opened in was approximately  per room 
internal growth 
through percentage rent  we participate in any increases in room revenues generated through increases in occupancy rates and average daily room rates or adr of the inns by jameson hospitality 
total rent payable under the jameson lease  including base rent and percentage rent  is limited  however  for each calendar year to of jameson hospitality s room revenues 
see the master leases  above 
jameson hospitality practices aggressive market sensitive pricing  increasing room rates at particular inns as market conditions in the specific communities warrant 
the inns site managers receive a significant portion of their compensation based on achieving specified monthly room revenues and annual expense controls 
marketing 
jameson hospitality is responsible for marketing the inns 
it focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in the city or town where the particular inn is located 
jameson hospitality currently employs direct sales managers  each of whom conducts and supervises direct sales for designated inns 
in addition  one of the key responsibilities of an inn s manager is to make sales calls on local chambers of commerce  businesses  factories  government installations and colleges and universities 
the goal of the sales call is to familiarize local business people with the inn in their community and solicit their recommendation of the inn to business travelers visiting communities where inns are located  including both individual discretionary travelers as well as groups attending family or community events 
jameson hospitality employs billboards and other similar types of advertising and has an number to facilitate reservations for the jameson inns 
since our acquisition of signature  jameson hospitality has maintained the reservation system previously used for the signature inns 
this system utilizes an number  but also interfaces with major electronic reservation systems such as sabre  apollo  worldspan  system one and amadeus 
this interface connects the signature inns with travel agents nationally and internationally 
in addition to billboard advertising which jameson hospitality has traditionally utilized and will continue to utilize  jameson hospitality places advertisements for the inns in regional and special event publications and in newspapers 
jameson hospitality also markets the inns through two websites www 
jamesoninns 
com and www 
signature inns 
com 
competition 
the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of the inns is located in an area that has competing hotels 
the number of competitive hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr  and revenue per available room  or revpar  of the inns 
many of the jameson inns are located in smaller communities where the entry of even one additional competitor into the market could materially affect the financial performance of the jameson inn in that community 
many of the signature inns are located in larger cities and communities in which significant new hotel and motel development is occurring 
the inns compete on the basis of price  quality and value 
competition for the inns is made up primarily of limited service hotels in the southeastern and midwestern united states operating under national franchises which have greater financial resources than we do  substantial advertising budgets  national reservation systems  marketing programs and greater name recognition 
regulations environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
while we have not incurred any such costs in connection with our ownership of the inns  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
we are not aware of any potential material liability or claims for which we may be responsible 
however  we cannot be certain that there are no material claims or liabilities related to real property which we own  future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us  or the current environmental condition of the inns will not be affected by their operations  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the inns such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties 
under the terms of the master leases  we indemnify jameson hospitality against environmental liabilities  except those caused by the acts or negligent failures of jameson hospitality 
in addition  the master leases provide that jameson hospitality will indemnify us against environmental liabilities caused by jameson hospitality s acts or negligent failures  although jameson hospitality s financial condition may limit the value of such indemnity and  in any event  such indemnity will not apply to or protect us against past unknown violations and related liabilities 
see the master leases  above 
we believe that the inns are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and do not anticipate that we will be required in the foreseeable future to expend any material amounts in order to comply with such ordinances and regulations 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of our present or former properties 
americans with disabilities act 
under the americans with disabilities act of or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to remedial costs  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we believe that all existing inns are substantially in compliance with these requirements and we intend to construct future inns in accordance with such requirements as well 
in  we engaged a disabilities consultant to make recommendations regarding compliance of the then existing jameson inns with the ada 
the consultant submitted a report recommending a number of improvements for access to and use by disabled persons with respect to certain of the jameson inns then in operation  which improvements were made 
we have also incorporated the consultant s recommendation into the construction of new jameson inns and will continue to do so 
employees at december   we employed persons 
our employees are also employees of jameson hospitality 
under a cost reimbursement agreement between jameson and jameson hospitality  we reimburse jameson hospitality for the time that these shared employees spend on our business 
for the year ended december   our reimbursement to jameson hospitality or its predecessor totaled approximately  none of our or jameson hospitality s employees is represented by a union or labor organization  nor have our or jameson hospitality s operations ever been interrupted by a work stoppage 
we consider relations with our employees to be excellent 
jameson hospitality 
jameson hospitality leases and operates all completed inns under the terms of the master leases

policies and objectives with respect to certain activities the following is a discussion of our investment objectives and policies  financing policies and policies with respect to certain other activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the sole discretion of our board of directors 
we can give no assurance that we will attain our investment objectives or that the value of jameson will not decrease 
investment objectives and policies 
our investment objective is to provide quarterly cash distributions and achieve long term capital appreciation through increases in cash flow and the value of jameson 
we will seek to accomplish these objectives through the ownership and leasing of the inns to jameson hospitality  selective development of additional inns  jameson hospitality s increases in the inns room revenues and  where deemed appropriate  renovations and expansions of the inns 
a key criterion for new investments will be the opportunity they offer for growth in funds from operations and cash available for distribution 
for definitions and calculation of funds from operations and cash available from operations  see item jameson management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we anticipate that we will conduct all of our activities directly  although inns located in certain states are owned by our subsidiaries and we may participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures  partnerships or other types of co ownership 
we currently intend to invest only in jameson inns and signature inns  although we may also hold temporary cash investments from time to time pending investment or distribution to stockholders 
through the signature merger in may  we acquired wholly owned signature inns and an interest as a general partner in a limited partnership which owned one additional signature inn in carmel  indiana 
in december  we acquired all of the interest of the limited partner in that partnership  dissolved the partnership and took direct ownership of the signature inn carmel which we now wholly own 
we may purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve properties  or sell such properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over our equity interest 
while we emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion  invest in mortgages  stock of other reits and other real estate interests 
mortgage investments may include participating or convertible mortgages 
however  we have not invested previously in mortgages or stock of other reits  and do not presently intend to do so 
dispositions 
in july we sold the jameson inn in milledgeville  georgia 
we also sold the jameson inn in clinton  tennessee  in february except for these properties  we have no current intention to dispose of any of the inns  although we reserve the right to do so if  based upon management s periodic review of our portfolio  the board of directors determines that this action would be in our best interests 
financing 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s the registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec that provides for the issuance of an aggregate of up to million in our common stock  preferred stock and common stock warrants to be offered and sold from time to time 
on march   we completed the sale of  newly issued shares of our common stock 
we used net proceeds of approximately million to repay certain existing mortgage indebtedness at that date 
in february  our stockholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from million to million shares and the authorized shares of preferred stock from  to million shares 
following adoption of that amendment  in we sold  under the registration statement   shares of our series a preferred stock at an offering price of per share 
we used the approximately million in net proceeds from the offering of series a preferred stock to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
in september  we filed a post effective amendment to the registration statement to permit us to sell up to  shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices through our designated sales agent  rcg brinson patrick  a division of ramius securities  llc 
through december   we have sold a total of  shares of common stock at the market 
these sales raised approximately  in net proceeds which we used to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
we intend to use additional net proceeds  if any  from any sale of securities under the registration statement for the repayment of existing indebtedness  working capital and general corporate purposes 
in the event we desire to raise additional equity capital  our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of jameson common stock or other capital stock of jameson in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
existing stockholders would have no preemptive right to purchase shares issued in any offering  and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder s investment in jameson 
we anticipate that any additional borrowings will be made directly by jameson 
indebtedness we incur may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured and unsecured  and publicly and privately placed debt instruments 
indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our inns or may be limited to the inn to which the indebtedness relates 
we may use the proceeds from any of our borrowings for the payment of distributions  for working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions  expansions or development of new inns 
at december   we had outstanding an aggregate of approximately million of mortgage debt  including approximately million in construction debt 
the construction debt provides for total borrowings of million and is secured by mortgages on inns 
in december and january  we refinanced approximately  of indebtedness secured by five signature inns  including the issuance of adjustable rate economic development revenue refunding bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  secured by four signature inns 
while our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur  we have adopted a policy of limiting our outstanding indebtedness to of the aggregate appraised values of the inns 
our board of directors could change our current policies and we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements 
this increase could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  our ability to make dividend distributions to its stockholders and could  as a result  jeopardize our status as a reit 
working capital reserves 
our policy is to maintain working capital reserves and when not sufficient  access to borrowings in amounts that our board of directors determines to be adequate to meet normal contingencies in connection with the operation of our business and investments 
policy regarding capital expenditures 
on july   we adopted a policy of maintaining cash or sufficient access to borrowings equal to of the jameson inns aggregate room revenues since july   less amounts actually spent from that date forward 
prior to this date  the obligation to fund replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment was jameson hospitality s 
this policy now extends to the signature inns acquired in may for the period july   through december   of room revenues equaled million and we expended million on items in that same period 
other policies 
we intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of we do not intend to invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such issuer  underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments 
we may make investments other than as previously described  although we do not currently intend to do so 
we have the authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our common stock or any of our other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
we have not repurchased  and have no present intention to repurchase  any shares of our common stock 
during the past five years  except in connection with the acquisition of billboard assets from jameson hospitality and the signature merger  we have not issued jameson common stock or any other securities in exchange for property  nor have we reacquired any of our common stock or any other securities  however  jameson has authority to engage in such activities and may do so in the future 
during the past five years  we have not made any loans to our officers  directors or other affiliates 
we may in the future make loans to such persons and entities  including  without limitation  our officers  and to joint ventures in which we participate 
during the last five years  we have not engaged in trading  underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers  and we do not intend to do so in the future 
our board of directors may review and modify our policies with respect to such activities from time to time without the vote of the stockholders 
at all times  we intend to make investments in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit unless  because of circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code or in the treasury regulations  our board of directors  with the consent of a majority of our stockholders  determines to revoke our reit election 
conflicts of interest 
because of thomas w 
kitchin s ownership in and positions with jameson and jameson hospitality  there are inherent conflicts of interest in the construction of new jameson inns and signature inns and expansion of existing inns by jameson hospitality 
conflicts of interest also exist in our dealings with jameson hospitality under the master leases  the construction contracts and under the cost reimbursement agreement between the two companies 
see the master leases  growth plans for  jameson hospitality as contractor  and employees 
in an effort to reduce the conflicts of interest  we have adopted a policy of requiring that any material transaction or arrangement between us and jameson hospitality  or an affiliate of either  is subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors 
further  jameson hospitality has agreed that neither it nor any of its affiliates will operate or manage a hotel property in which we have not invested that is within a mile radius of an inn  or own or have any interest in any inn in which we or affiliates do not have an interest 
our board of directors also has a policy that any contract or transaction between us and one or more of our directors or officers  or between us and any other entity in which one or more of our directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial interest must be approved by a majority of either our independent directors or disinterested shareholders after the material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to them 
the board of directors may change this policy without the consent of the shareholders upon the affirmative vote of a majority of our independent directors 
taxation of jameson we made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  commencing with our taxable year beginning january  we believe that commencing with the taxable year  we were organized and we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but we cannot guarantee that we have operated in a manner  or will operate in a manner in the future  so as to remain qualified as a reit 
the sections of the internal revenue code relating to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion summarizes the material aspects of the internal revenue code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its shareholders 
because it is a summary  it does not cover all aspects of this subject 
in order to understand all of the rules and regulations applicable to us as a reit  you need to refer to the applicable internal revenue code provisions  treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
as long as we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on our net income that is currently distributed to our shareholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation 
however  we will be subject to federal income or excise tax as follows first  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our reit taxable income  which is defined generally as taxable income subject to certain adjustments  including net capital gains  less dividends or certain deemed dividends paid to shareholders 
second  we will generally be subject to the alternative minimum tax if reit taxable income plus any tax adjustments and preferences is greater than dividends paid to shareholders 
third  if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business or other nonqualifying net income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if we have net income from prohibited transactions generally certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  this income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if we should fail to satisfy the or gross income tests discussed below and have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  we will be subject to a tax on the net income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the or gross income tests 
sixth  generally  if we fail to distribute to our shareholders during each calendar year an amount equal to our required distribution  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution amount over the amount actually distributed for the year 
the amount of required distribution is equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain net income for such year and the amount  if any  of the required distribution for the previous year over the amount actually distributed for that year 
in addition  if during the year period the recognition period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which we qualified as a reit  we recognize gain on the disposition of any asset held by us as of the beginning of such recognition period  then  to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over our adjusted basis in such asset as of the beginning of the recognition period the jameson built in gain  such jameson built in gain  which may be reduced by certain net operating loss carryforwards  will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the recognition period began january   and will expire december  further  if we acquire any asset from a c corporation in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation such as our acquisition of signature inns by reason of our acquisition of signature inns  inc on may   the signature built in gain  and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the ten year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us  then  to the extent of the signature built in gain  such gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate  pursuant to regulations that have not yet been promulgated 
the amount of our jameson built in gain based on the appraisals obtained in connection with our initial public offering in is approximately million and will discourage a disposition by us of any inn held at the time until after the amount of our signature built in gain attributable to the signature inns acquisition is less than million 
requirements for qualification the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the internal revenue code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the internal revenue code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  at any time during the last half of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities  which makes an election to be a reit and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs that must be met in order to elect and maintain reit status  which uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and complies with the record keeping requirements of the internal revenue code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets 
the internal revenue code provides that conditions to  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
we have represented that we have met since we became a publicly held company  and we currently do meet  all of such definitional requirements 
income tests in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must satisfy two gross income tests annually 
first  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property and  in certain circumstances  interest or qualified temporary investment income 
second  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments  and from dividends and other types of interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities 
rents received by us under the master leases with jameson hospitality will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
therefore  the percentage rent provisions of the master leases should not disqualify rental income received from jameson hospitality 
second  the internal revenue code provides that rents received from a tenant  directly or indirectly  will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if the reit  or a direct or indirect owner of or more of the reit  directly or constructively owns or more of such tenant a related party tenant 
we believe that since january   we have satisfied  and we will use our best efforts to continue to satisfy this requirement 
therefore  jameson hospitality is not and should not become a related party tenant of jameson by reason of our adherence to the ownership limit and the related party limit 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
applicable internal revenue code provisions provide that with respect to each lease  rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent as the average of a reit s adjusted bases of all personal property at the beginning and at the end of each taxable year bears to the average of the reit s aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year 
we have confirmed by numerical testing that the resulting rental income attributable to personal property since january  has been less than 
we monitor these tests regularly 
if we project that for any inn for any taxable year the resulting rental income attributable to personal property may exceed of all rental income  a portion of the personal property of that inn may be sold by us to jameson hospitality  with the lease payments adjusted accordingly 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  the reit generally must not operate or manage the leased property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit derives no revenue  provided  however  we may directly perform certain services other than services which are considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
we have not  do not and will not knowingly charge rent for any property that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except by reason of being based on a percentage of receipts or sales  as described above  rent any property to a related party tenant  lease personal property in connection with the rental of any inn which would cause the rental income attributable to such personal property to exceed of the amount of total rental income  or iv perform services considered to be rendered for the occupants of the inns other than through an independent contractor 
under the master leases  jameson hospitality has leased the land  buildings  improvements  furnishings  and equipment comprising the inns from us 
jameson hospitality pays us a per room rent base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the gross room rental revenues percentage rent  with the total of the base rent and percentage rent being called total rent 
in order for the total rent to constitute rents from real property  the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not treated as service contracts  joint venture or some other type of arrangement 
the determination of whether the leases are true leases depends on an analysis of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances 
in addition  pursuant to section e of the internal revenue code  a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement may be treated instead as a lease of property if the contract  agreement or arrangement is properly treated as a lease of property  taking into account all relevant factors  including whether or not the service recipient is in physical possession of the property  the service recipient controls the property  the service recipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property eg  the property s use is likely to be dedicated to the service recipient for a substantial portion of the useful life of the property  the service recipient shares the risk that the property will decline in value  the service recipient shares in any appreciation in the value of the property  the service recipient shares in savings in the property s operating costs  or the service recipient bears the risk of damage to or loss of the property  the service provider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or substantially increased expenditures if there is nonperformance under the lease  the service provider does not use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the service recipient and the contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the term of the lease 
under the master leases  jameson hospitality has the right to exclusive possession  use and quiet enjoyment of the inns during the term of the master leases  jameson hospitality bears the cost of  and is responsible for daily maintenance and repair of the inns  other than the cost of maintaining underground utilities and structural elements including the roofs of the improvements  jameson hospitality dictates how the inns are operated  maintained  and improved and bears all of the costs and expenses of operating the inns including the cost of any inventory used in their operation during the term of the leases other than real and personal property taxes  casualty  liability and other types of insurance and equipment and the maintenance of structural elements  roofs and underground utilities  jameson hospitality benefits from any savings in the costs of operating the inns during the term of the leases  in the event of damage or destruction to an inn  jameson hospitality is at economic risk because it will be obligated to restore the property to its prior condition and bear all costs of such restoration in excess of any insurance proceeds except  under certain circumstances  during the last six months of the term of the master leases  jameson hospitality has indemnified us against all liabilities imposed on us during the term of the master leases by reason of injury to persons or damage to property occurring at the inns or due to jameson hospitality s use  management  maintenance or repair of the inns  and jameson hospitality is obligated to pay substantial fixed rent for the term of the leases 
in addition  we do not believe that the total rent under the leases materially  if not all  exceeds the fair rental value of the inns 
pursuant to irs revenue ruling  if one or more of the following conditions are present  the master leases will instead be considered as conditional contracts for purchase and sale of the inns portions of the periodic payments are made specifically applicable to an equity interest in the property to be acquired by jameson hospitality  jameson hospitality will acquire title upon the payment of a stated amount of rentals under the contract which it is required to make  the total amount which jameson hospitality is required to pay for a relatively short period of use constitutes an inordinately large proportion of the total sum required to be paid to secure the transfer of the title  the agreed rental payments materially exceed the current fair rental value  the property may be acquired under a purchase option at a price which is nominal in relation to the value of the property at the time when the option may be exercised  as determined at the time of entering into the original agreement  or which is a relatively small amount when compared with the total payments which are required to be made  and some portion of the periodic payments is specifically designated as interest or is otherwise readily recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
under the master leases  no portion of the total rent has been or will be applied to any equity interest in the inns to be acquired by jameson hospitality  jameson hospitality has not acquired and will not be acquiring title to the inns upon the payment of a stated amount of either base rent or percentage rent  the total rent does not and will not materially exceed the current fair rental value of the inns  the inns may not be acquired by jameson hospitality under a purchase option and no portion of either base rent or percentage rent has been or will be specifically designated as interest or will be recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
we believe that the master leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
however  the irs could challenge the tax treatment of the master leases  and  if it does  it could be successful 
if the master leases are recharacterized as a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement rather than a true lease  part or all of the payments that we receive from jameson hospitality may not satisfy the various requirements for qualification as rents from real property 
in that case  we likely would not be able to satisfy either the or gross income tests and  as a result  would fail to qualify as a reit 
any gross income derived from a prohibited transaction is subject to a tax 
the term prohibited transaction generally includes a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
none of our assets are or have been held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business and we will not sell an inn or associated property in the ordinary course of our business 
whether property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular property 
nevertheless  we have since january  complied with and we will attempt to continue to comply with the terms of the safe harbor provisions in the internal revenue code prescribing when asset sales will not be characterized as prohibited transactions 
complete assurance cannot be given  however  that we can comply with the safe harbor provisions of the internal revenue code or avoid owning property that may be characterized as property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
these relief provisions will generally be available if our failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we attach a schedule of the sources of our gross income to our return  and any incorrect information on such schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
we cannot state  however  whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
as discussed above  even if these relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed which would be equal to the excess of or of our gross income over our qualifying income in the relevant category  whichever is greater  multiplied by the ratio that reit taxable income bears to gross income for the taxable year with certain adjustments 
asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must also satisfy three tests relating to the nature of our assets 
first  at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which means real property including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property  shares in other reits stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of the company  and cash  cash items including receivables and government securities 
second  not more than of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class 
third  of the investments included in the asset class  the value of any one issuer s securities owned by us may not exceed of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than of such issuer s outstanding voting securities 
we have satisfied these asset tests since january   and we will use our best efforts to continue to satisfy such tests in the future 
after meeting the assets tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
we maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset test and we intend to take such other action within days after the close of any quarter as may be required to cure any noncompliance 
however  this action may not always be successful 
annual distribution requirements in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and any net capital gain and of our net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
in addition  if we dispose of any asset during our recognition period  we will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we should fail to distribute our required distribution during each calendar year  we would be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
since january   we have made  and we hereafter will make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy all annual distribution requirements 
however  it is possible that  from time to time  we may experience timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our reit taxable income 
therefore  we could have less cash available for distribution than would be necessary to meet our annual distribution requirement or to avoid federal corporate income tax with respect to capital gain or the nondeductible excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income 
to meet the distribution requirement necessary to qualify as a reit or to avoid federal income tax with respect to capital gain or the excise tax  it could be necessary for us to borrow funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying dividends to shareholders in a later year 
if we declare a dividend before the date on which our tax return is due for a taxable year including extensions and distribute the amount of such dividend to shareholders in the month period following the close of such taxable year  such subsequent year dividend may be deductible in computing our reit taxable income for the immediately preceding year 
the distribution of such dividend must be made no later than the date of the first regular dividend payment made after the declaration and distribution of such dividend and we must elect such treatment in our return 
shareholders receiving subsequent year distributions are taxable on such distributions in the year of actual receipt except in the following case 
any distributions we declare in october  november or december of any year payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholder on december  provided that the distribution is actually paid during january of the following calendar year 
however  if we actually pay the declared distributions before december  the distributions will be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholders on the actual dates paid and received  respectively 
if  as a result of an audit by the irs  the reit taxable income for a prior taxable year is increased  we may elect to distribute an additional deficiency dividend  as defined under section of the internal revenue code  and claim an additional deduction for dividends paid for such taxable year in order to meet the annual distribution requirement 
all deficiency dividends must be distributed within days after the final determination of an audit  and the claim for such deficiency dividends must be filed within days of such determination 
we would also be liable for the payment of interest charges on the amount of the deficiency dividend 
however  the payment of such dividends would ensure that our qualification as a reit would not be jeopardized due to a failure to meet our annual distribution requirement 
failure to qualify if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and the relief provisions do not apply  we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to shareholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made 
in such event  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  all distributions to shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income  and  subject to certain limitations of the internal revenue code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction such deduction is not available to corporate distributees so long as we qualify as a reit 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
taxation of shareholders tax consequences to non tax exempt us shareholders 
as long as we qualify as a reit  distributions made to our taxable us shareholders from current or accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taken into account by such us shareholders as ordinary income in the year they are received and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations 
such distributions will be treated as portfolio income and not as income from passive activities 
accordingly  shareholders will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income 
distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long term capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which a shareholder has held our stock 
however  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of such us shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a us shareholder s shares  such distributions will be included in income as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less assuming the shares are held as a capital asset by the us shareholder 
shareholders may not include in their income tax returns any net operating losses or capital losses of the company 
finally  in general  any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a shareholder who has held such shares for more than one year after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as a long term capital loss to the extent of distributions from us required to be treated by such shareholder as long term capital gain 
in determining the extent to which a distribution on the series a preferred stock or series s preferred stock constitutes a dividend for tax purposes  our earnings and profits will be allocated  on a pro rata basis  first to distributions with respect to the series a preferred stock and the series s preferred stock  and then to the common stock 
under the internal revenue code we are permitted to make an election to treat all or a portion of our undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to our shareholders 
if we were to make such an election  our shareholders would be required to include in their income as long term capital gain their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain  as we designated 
each of our shareholders would be deemed to have paid his proportionate share of our income tax with respect to such undistributed net capital gain  and this amount would be credited or refunded to the shareholder 
in addition  the tax basis of the shareholder s stock would be increased by his or her proportionate share of undistributed net capital gain included in his or her income less his or her proportionate share of our income tax with respect to such gains 
with respect to distributions we designate as capital gain dividends  we may designate subject to certain limits whether the dividend is taxable to shareholders as a rate gain distribution or as an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a rate 
information reporting requirements and backup withholding 
we will report to our us shareholders and the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any 
under the backup withholding rules  a us shareholder may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of with respect to distributions paid unless such holder a is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and  when required  demonstrates this fact  or b provides a taxpayer identification number  certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules 
a shareholder that does not provide us with his correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs 
any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the shareholder s income tax liability 
in addition  we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their non foreign status to us 
see below taxation of non us shareholders 
taxation of tax exempt shareholders 
distributions to a us shareholder that is a tax exempt entity should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section a of the internal revenue code ubti  provided that the tax exempt entity has not financed the acquisition of our shares with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of section c of the internal revenue code and the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax exempt entity 
in addition  if we are considered to be a pension held reit  then a portion of the dividends paid to qualified trusts any trust defined under section a and exempt from tax under section a that owns more than percent by value in the reit may be considered ubti 
in general  a pension held reit is a reit that is held by at least one qualified trust holding more than by value of the interests in the reit or by one or more qualified trusts each of whom owns more than by value holding in the aggregate more than by value of the interests in the reit 
we are not currently a pension held reit 
taxation of non us shareholders 
the rules governing united states federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals  foreign corporations  foreign partnerships and other foreign shareholders collectively  non us shareholders are complex and we will make no attempt herein to provide more than a summary of such rules 
the treasury department issued new final regulations relating to withholding  information reporting and backup withholding on us source income paid to foreign persons including  for example  dividends we pay to our foreign shareholders 
these regulations generally will be effective with respect to payments made after december   subject to certain transition rules 
we urge prospective investors to consult their own tax advisors as to the effect  if any  of the final regulations on their purchase  ownership and disposition of shares of common stock 
distributions to non us shareholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests and not designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent their source is our current or accumulated earnings and profits 
such distributions will ordinarily be subject to a withholding tax equal to of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax 
however  if income from a non us shareholder s investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the non us shareholder s conduct of a united states trade or business  the non us shareholder generally will be subject to a tax at graduated rates  in the same manner as us shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and may also be subject to the branch profits tax in the case of a shareholder that is a foreign corporation 
we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a non us shareholder unless a lower treaty rate applies or the non us shareholder files an irs form with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a non us shareholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the non us shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits exceed the adjusted basis of a non us shareholder s shares  such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non us shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of his shares in jameson  as described below 
if it cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  the distribution will be subject to withholding at a rate 
further  pursuant to recently enacted legislation  we will be required to withhold of any distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
however  amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that such distribution was in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the non us shareholder s non us tax liability  if any 
for any year in which we qualify as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from our sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will be taxed to a non us shareholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of firpta 
under firpta  distributions attributable to gain from sales of united states real property interests are taxed to a non us shareholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a united states business 
non us shareholders would thus be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
also  distributions subject to firpta may be subject to a branch profits tax in the case of a foreign corporate shareholder not entitled to treaty exemption 
we are required by treasury regulations to withhold of any distribution to a non us shareholder that could be designated by us as a capital gains dividend 
this amount is creditable against the non us shareholder s firpta tax liability 
gain recognized by a non us shareholder upon a sale of shares generally will not be taxed under firpta if we are a domestically controlled reit  defined generally as a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of the reit s stock was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit  and therefore the sale of our shares should not be subject to taxation under firpta 
we anticipate that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit and that sales of our shares by non us shareholders will not be subject to us taxation unless the investment in the shares is effectively connected with the non us shareholder s trade or business in the united states  in which case such non us shareholder would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax  or in the case of a non us shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual  such non us shareholder was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply  in which case such person would be subject to a tax on his capital gains 
other tax consequences we and our shareholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions  including those in which we or they transact business or reside 
the state and local tax treatment of jameson and our shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 
consequently  you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in us

item selected financial data the following table sets forth our selected financial and operating information on a pro forma and historical basis 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated historical financial data has been derived from our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
historical financial and operating information includes all jameson inns owned by jameson  including both those under development as well as operating jameson inns  however  due to jameson s development of new jameson inns and expansion of existing jameson inns  the information is not comparable between periods 
historical financial and operating information includes all signature inns owned by jameson as of december  see item properties 
historical operating results  including net income  may not be comparable to future operating results 
the historical financial data for signature inns was prepared from the audited financial statements and filings of signature for each of the years in the period ended december  the information for the year ended december  assumes the signature inns were operated by jameson hospitality for the entire year

jameson has made adjustments to its net income loss consisting only of depreciation  loss on disposals  loss on impairment of real estate and the extraordinary item 
jameson notes that industry analysts and investors use funds from operations as another tool to evaluate and compare equity reits 
jameson also believes it is meaningful as an indicator of net income excluding most non cash items and provides information about jameson s cash available for distributions  debt service and capital expenditures 
other non cash expenses such as deferred finance cost amortization and stock based compensation expense have not been added back in funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all of jameson s cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measure as an indicator of performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  jameson s funds from operations may not be comparable to other companies funds from operations due to differing methods of calculating funds from operations and varying interpretations of the nareit definition 
in october  nareit issued an additional clarification effective as of january  stipulating that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results 
consistent with this clarification  non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under gaap will be reflected in the calculation of ffo 
gains and losses from the sale of depreciable operating property will continue to be excluded from the calculation of ffo 
for purposes of computing these ratios  earnings have been calculated by adding fixed charges excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends to income before extraordinary item 
fixed charges consist of interest costs whether expensed or capitalized  amortization of debt discounts and issue costs whether expensed or capitalized and preferred stock dividends in applicable periods 
jameson paid preferred stock dividends in  and the master leases between jameson and jameson hospitality with regard to the jameson inns and the signature inns define room revenues to include gross room rentals  revenues from telephone charges  vending machine payments and other miscellaneous revenues and excludes all credits  rebates and refunds  sales taxes and other excise taxes 
assumes that the signatures inns were owned as of january of the respective year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and those of jameson hospitality and the accompanying notes which are included in this report 
general the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the years indicated 
year ended december occupancy rate adr revpar room rentals s    other inn revenues s  room revenues s    room nights available    operating inns at period end rooms available at period end    we have grown from a hotel chain with four jameson inns rooms at january   to jameson inns  rooms and signature inns  rooms in operation at december  from our inception in until december   we were engaged in the business of developing  owning and managing jameson inns 
as part of our development activities  we engaged in development and construction of new jameson inns 
on december   we reorganized by divesting ourselves of the subsidiary corporations through which we conducted our construction activities  securities brokerage activities and aviation operations 
in addition  we transferred our outdoor advertising business to jameson hospitality s predecessor 
we no longer manage or operate our inns upon their completion  but limit our primary activities to developing and owning the properties 
effective january   our primary source of revenue became lease payments by jameson hospitality which leases and operates our inns under the master leases 
effective april   our subsidiary  jameson outdoor advertising company  acquired certain assets of jameson hospitality consisting of billboards  ground leases for the sites on which the billboards are erected and other related assets 
as consideration for these assets we issued  shares of our series a preferred stock  paid cash in the amount of  and assumed liabilities in the amount of approximately  we obtained an opinion from interstate johnson lane corporation that the terms of the transaction were fair from a financial standpoint to us and to our shareholders 
in order to maintain our reit status  these assets are leased to and operated by jameson hospitality which pays us annual rentals on each of the billboards 
in  rental payments from these assets totaled approximately  on may   we merged with signature inns  inc which owned and operated a chain of limited service hotels in the midwest 
in this merger  we acquired signature inns and an interest in a limited partnership which owned an additional signature inn 
in december  we acquired the outstanding limited partnership interest in that partnership  dissolved the partnership and took direct ownership of the hotel property 
as a result of these transactions  at december   we owned a total of signature inns located in six midwestern states 
all of the signature inns are also leased to jameson hospitality 
although room revenues are earned by our lessee  jameson hospitality  not by us  they are the basis upon which the percentage rent paid to us by jameson hospitality under the jameson lease is determined and  accordingly  we discuss those revenues below 
the term same inn room revenues refers to revenues earned with respect to our inns which were operating during all of both comparison periods and includes revenues attributable to rooms added to our existing inns by virtue of expansion of such inns 
the master leases provide for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended december   we earned a combined base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million from rental of jameson inns and million from rental of signature inns 
the principal determinant of percentage rent under the master leases is room revenues of our inns 
therefore  we believe that a review of the historical performance of the operations of our operating jameson inns and signature inns  particularly with respect to occupancy  adr and revpar  is appropriate for understanding our lease revenue see funds from operations  cash available for distribution  below  for the calculation of adr and revpar 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  our lease revenue for increased to million as compared to million for the increase was due to an increase in jameson hospitality s room revenues 
as a result of the following three factors  jameson hospitality s room revenues rose  from million for to million in the number of room nights available at our inns increased from  in to  in  or  due primarily to our acquisition of signature in may  which accounted for  of the additional room nights available  and to the opening from january through december of new jameson inns  total additional rooms and expansions of existing jameson inns total additional rooms 
the occupancy rate for all inns decreased from for to for the decrease in overall occupancy of the inns is attributable primarily to additional competition in certain markets  and the expansion of several high occupancy jameson inns which then experienced lower occupancy rates because of the additional rooms available 
adr increased from in to in due primarily to the addition of the signature inns which experienced an adr of for the period of may   through december  jameson hospitality s same inn room revenues for jameson inns for compared to grew to million from million  or

our property taxes and insurance expenses totaled million in  compared with million for the increase is attributable primarily to the increase in the number of inns as a result of the signature acquisition in may and to the construction and expansion of jameson inns 
our interest expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in our average outstanding debt balance in this was the result primarily of our assumption of an additional million of indebtedness in connection with the signature acquisition in may and increased indebtedness related to the development of new jameson inns 
our depreciation expense increased from million in to million in  due primarily to the signature acquisition in may and to an increase in the number of operating jameson inns and the expansion of existing jameson inns during our loss on disposal of furniture and equipment increased from  in to  in due to an increase in replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment before the end of its depreciable life

funds from operations  cash available for distribution the following table illustrates our calculation of funds from operations and cash available for distribution on a historical basis for the years ended december   and in march  nareit published a new interpretation of funds from operations which we retroactively adopted at that time 
in october  nareit issued an additional clarification effective as of january  stipulating that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results 
consistent with this clarification  non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under gaap will be reflected in the calculation of ffo 
gains and losses from the sale of depreciable operating property will continue to be excluded from the calculation of ffo

liquidity and capital resources we expect to continue to develop additional jameson inns and signature inns and to expand existing jameson inns  as suitable opportunities arise 
we will not undertake such investments  however  unless adequate sources of financing are available 
since our election to be taxed as a reit  we have financed construction of new jameson inns and currently intend to continue financing the construction of new jameson inns and signature inns entirely with bank borrowings 
we believe we can continue to finance new inns and expansions with these construction and long term mortgage loans 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding debt 
at that date we had two operating jameson inns and one signature inn which were debt free and could be used as collateral if we need additional borrowing capacity 
jameson has million in lines of credit the line with some convertible to term notes beginning in at december   we had drawn down million under the line with million remaining available credit 
loans made under the line bear interest at rates initially ranging from to  which are adjustable annually to a spread over the prime rate plus 
to 
percentage points 
the minimum annual interest rate payable is and the maximum is 
the annual interest rates at december   ranged from to 
loans made under the line are secured by mortgages on of the jameson inns 
payments of interest are due monthly  and monthly payments of principal and interest commence at various dates beginning in april principal under each term loan under the line is amortized using a year period and is payable in full at various dates through we use the line to purchase land and to supplement the financing of construction costs  and certain other operating needs including the payment of dividends and other operating expenses 
in january  we entered into an agreement with a bank to provide million in new financing  which is secured by operating jameson inns which were previously debt free 
this bank note bears interest at the weekly average yield on united states treasury securities adjusted to the constant maturity of one year plus per annum and is adjusted annually 
monthly installments of principal and interest are due through maturity in monthly deposits of  are required to be deposited into a replacement reserve escrow account until a balance of  has been achieved 
the proceeds of this financing were used to repay amounts outstanding under the line 
in december  we obtained a ten year term loan in the principal amount of million to refinance the signature inn carmel and to provide funds for our purchase of the remaining interest in the partnership which had owned the property 
the interest rate on the loan is the prime rate plus 
and adjusts annually 
at december   the interest rate was 
payments of principal and interest are due monthly 
repayment of the loan is secured by the inn 
in december and january  we refinanced indebtedness secured by four signature inns by issuance of adjustable rate economic development revenue refunding bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  the bonds mature on december   subject to prior optional and mandatory redemption  and are subject to mandatory purchase under certain conditions 
the interest rates on the bonds adjust weekly and ranged from to in december historically  we have utilized construction and long term mortgage financing to fund the balance of construction costs of inns not funded under the line 
for each new jameson inn to be built  we generally obtain a construction loan for approximately to million depending on the size of the inn to be built 
after an month interest only period  each construction loan converts to a long term mortgage financing upon completion of the inn without any further action by us  and is amortized over a or year period and payable in full seven years from its inception 
the interest rate on each of the loans adjusts annually  to rates ranging from the then prevailing prime rate plus 
to prime plus 
as of december   the construction loans are secured by mortgages on of the jameson inns under construction 
as of december   we had a total of new jameson inns and one expansion of an existing jameson inn under construction with total remaining construction costs  excluding land  expected to total million when the projects are complete 
for of these properties  we had obtained construction loans during and totaling million with remaining availability of million at december  to fund the completion of the properties under construction we will use the remaining availability under the construction loans  availability on the line and proceeds from the financing of the two or unencumbered inns and the refinancing of inns with increased borrowing capacity 
the availability on the line at december  was million 
since we presently intend to rely primarily on borrowings for construction and permanent financing of new jameson inns and signature inns and for the expansion of existing jameson inns  the lack of sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could prevent or significantly deter us from constructing new jameson inns or expanding existing jameson inns 
the availability of such financing depends on a number of factors over which we have no control  including general economic conditions  the economic and competitive environments of the communities in which the inns are located and the level and stability of long term interest rates 
we are also considering possible additional long term debt or equity financing that would be available to fund its ongoing development activities 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec to provide additional financing 
in september  we filed a post effective amendment to that registration statement 
see item business policies and objectives with respect to certain activities financing for a description of the registration statement and post effective amendment 
as with most real estate investments  our investments in the inns are relatively illiquid and such illiquidity is further increased by the location of many jameson inns in small communities 
as a result  the ability of jameson to sell or otherwise dispose of any inn to provide liquidity will be very limited 
we have four stock incentive plans in place 
as of december    shares of our common stock were reserved for future stock option and restricted stock grants and previously issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock were outstanding including  which were exercisable 
in addition  as of december    shares of our common stock issued to certain key employees of jameson and jameson hospitality are restricted as to sale until fully vested in  and year a critical business issue has emerged regarding how existing application software programs and operating systems can accommodate the year date value 
many existing application software products in the market place were designed to accommodate only two digit date entries 
beginning in the year  these systems and products must be able to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from prior years 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies have required or still may require to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
jameson and jameson hospitality conducted an assessment of their computer and other operating systems to identify those which could be affected by the year issue 
the assessment included the review of corporate and hotel applications  hardware  and software information technology or it  and non it areas such as microprocessors and embedded chips 
on going testing of existing systems  to determine compliance  were completed by november systems that were determined to be non compliant were repaired or replaced by november the remediation phase included modification to  or replacement of  software  and hardware or microprocessors 
approximately  was expended by jameson hospitality for year remediation 
neither we nor jameson hospitality tracked the internal costs incurred for the year project principally the payroll and related costs for our information systems group 
the costs of the project were funded through operating cash flows of the companies 
we and jameson hospitality rely on third party consultants and suppliers for a variety of our corporate and inn operations 
the ability of third parties to adequately address their year issues is outside of our control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of jameson and jameson hospitality  or such third parties  to adequately address their respective year issues will not have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
jameson and jameson hospitality believe they have an effective program in place which will resolve the year issues in a timely manner 
year risks include failure to obtain successful testing of hardware software  failed attempts to obtain vendor compliance  and failure on the part of suppliers and service providers 
jameson and jameson hospitality believe that under most reasonably likely worst case scenarios inn operations could be disrupted  a reduction in inn occupancy could occur due to lost reservations  or corporate financial functions could be impaired 
this event would cause certain processes to revert to manual systems and could have a material adverse impact on jameson and jameson hospitality s operating results and financial position 
jameson and jameson hospitality maintain contingency plans in their normal course of business designed to be deployed in the event of various potential business interruptions 
contingency plans were implemented between december and december   for systems that could not be feasibly repaired or replaced 
no material business disruptions have occurred to date for us or jameson hospitality as a result of year issues 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
jameson hospitality raised its room rates for jameson inns by approximately in  in and in and by approximately for signature inns since may nevertheless  competitive pressures have limited  and may in the future limit  jameson hospitality s ability to raise rates in the face of inflation
