this amount was largely offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net trade accounts receivable increased from june  to june  and days sales outstanding in receivables increased to days at june  from days at june  the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to sales growth which was in fiscal inventory increased due to overall growth and from acquisitions including the purchase of approximately million in inventory from hp pursuant to the acquisition of vid in august this inventory purchase occurred in february and march of and was paid in april inventory management remains an area of focus as pinnacle balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and provide timely customer service versus the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements

factors affecting operating results x there are various factors which may cause our net revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include increased competition and pricing pressure timing of significant orders from and shipments to major customers  including oem s and our large broadcast accounts 
timing and market acceptance of new products success in developing  introducing and shipping new products dependence on distribution channels through which our products are sold accuracy of our and our resellers forecasts of end user demand accuracy of inventory forecasts ability to obtain sufficient supplies from our subcontractors timing and level of consumer product returns foreign currency fluctuations costs of integrating acquired operations general domestic and international economic conditions  such as the recent economic downturns in asia and latin america we also experience significant fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations  the timing of major trade shows and the sale of consumer products in anticipation of the holiday season 
sales usually slow down during the summer months of july and august  especially in europe 
also  we attend a number of annual trade shows which can influence the order pattern of products  including cebit in march  the nab convention held in april and the ibc convention held in september 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenue and  as a result  net income would be disproportionately affected by a shortfall in net sales 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
x we have grown rapidly and expect to continue to grow rapidly 
if we fail to effectively manage this growth  our financial results could suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth and anticipate that we will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the future 
for example  net sales in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
as a result of internal growth and recent acquisitions  we have increased the number of employees significantly over the last two fiscal years and many are geographically dispersed  primarily throughout north america and europe 
this growth places increasing demands on our management  financial and other resources 
we have built resources and systems to account for such growth  but continued or accelerated growth may require us to increase our investment in such systems  or to reorganize our management team 
such changes  should they occur  could cause an interruption or diversion of focus from our core business activities and have an adverse effect on financial results 
x any failure to successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired could negatively impact us 
in june  we acquired avid sports  inc  and in april  we acquired montage group  ltd 
in march  we acquired digital editing services  inc and puffin designs  inc also  in  we acquired the video communications division of the hewlett packard company  truevision  inc and shoreline studios  inc we may in the near or long term pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
integrating acquired operations is a complex  time consuming and potentially expensive process 
all acquisitions involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include distracting management from the day to day operations of our business costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations  products and personnel the potential to result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities incurring debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets x our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and could in the future fluctuate significantly 
the fluctuations have been or could be in response to numerous factors including quarterly variations in results of operations announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors changes in securities analysts recommendations announcements of acquisitions changes in earnings estimates made by independent analysts general fluctuations in the stock market our revenues and results of operations may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors 
this could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in july  we announced that financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which ended june   would be lower than the then current analyst consensus estimates regarding pinnacle s quarterly results 
in the day following this announcement  our share price lost more than of its value and our shares continue to trade in a price range significantly lower than the range held by our shares before this announcement 
with the advent of the internet  new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information 
pinnacle has no control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms 
the motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in the best interest of pinnacle and its shareholders 
this  in addition to other forms of investment information including newsletters and research publications  could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for high technology companies have been particularly affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been brought against the issuing company 
on july   a lawsuit entitled jiminez v 
pinnacle systems  inc  et al  no 
cv was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against pinnacle and certain officer and director defendants 
we have publicly announced that we intend to defend the case vigorously 
it is possible that additional similar litigation could be brought against us in the future 
the securities class action lawsuit described above and any similar litigation which may be brought against pinnacle could result in substantial costs and will likely divert management s attention and resources 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
x we are dependent on contract manufacturers and single or limited source suppliers for our components 
if these manufacturers and suppliers do not meet our demand either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture our desktop and consumer products and the major subassemblies of our broadcast products 
we and our manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of components and parts used in our products  including certain key integrated circuits 
our strategy to rely on subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process potential absence of adequate capacity potential delays in lead times unavailability of certain process technologies reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs unexpected increases in component costs if any significant subcontractor or single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these subassemblies or provide critical components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available and product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
this could materially harm our business 
any extended interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products  subassemblies or components manufactured by third party subcontractors or suppliers could materially harm our business 
x if our products do not keep pace with the technological developments in the rapidly changing video post production equipment industry  then we may be adversely affected 
the video post production equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  our inability to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain significant market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could materially harm our business  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we are critically dependent on the successful introduction  market acceptance  manufacture and sale of new products that offer our customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
once a new product is developed  we must rapidly commence volume production 
this process requires accurate forecasting of customer requirements and attainment of acceptable manufacturing costs 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older  displaced products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
in addition  as is typical with any new product introduction  quality and reliability problems may arise 
any such problems could result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service warranty costs and a limitation on market acceptance of the product 
x if we do not effectively compete  our business will be harmed 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
we compete in the broadcast  desktop and consumer video production markets 
we anticipate increased competition in each of the broadcast  desktop and consumer video production markets  particularly since the industry is undergoing a period of technological change and consolidation 
competition for our broadcast  consumer and video products is generally based on product performance breadth of product line quality of service and support market presence price ability of competitors to develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products certain competitors in the broadcast  desktop and consumer video markets have larger financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we do 
in addition  some competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of ours and offer a wide variety of video equipment that can be bundled in certain large system sales 
principal competitors in the broadcast market include accom  inc chyron corporation grass valley group leitch technology corporation matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd 
quantel ltd 
a division of carlton communications plc seachange corporation sony corporation tektronix  inc principal competitors in the desktop and consumer markets are accom  inc adobe systems  inc apple computer avid technology  inc dazzle multimedia digitel processing systems  inc fast multimedia hauppauge digital  inc matrox electronics systems  ltd 
media  inc sony corporation these lists are not all inclusive 
the consumer market in which certain of our products compete is an emerging market and the sources of competition are not yet well defined 
there are several established video companies that are currently offering products or solutions that compete directly or indirectly with our consumer products by providing some or all of the same features and video editing capabilities 
in addition  we expect that existing manufacturers and new market entrants will develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products that may compete directly with our consumer products 
we expect that potential competition in this market is likely to come from existing video editing companies  software application companies  or new entrants into the market  many of which have the financial resources  marketing and technical ability to develop products for the consumer video market 
increased competition in any of these markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
any of these effects could materially harm our business 
we rely heavily on dealers and oems to market  sell and distribute our products 
in turn  we depend heavily on the success of these resellers 
if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  then our financial performance will be negatively affected 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
our dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time refuse to promote or pay for our products discontinue our products in favor of a competitor s product also  with these distribution channels standing between us and the actual market  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand for products and anticipate demand for newly introduced products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores stocked with the newest products and not because there is a significant demand for them 
as to consumer products offerings  we have expanded our distribution network to include several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
we also sell our consumer products directly to certain retailers 
rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors have characterized distribution channels for consumer retail products 
these arrangements have exposed us to the following risks  some of which are out of our control we are obligated to provide price protection to such retailers and distributors and  while the agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned to us  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our consumer products 
retailers and retail distributors often carry competing products x we must retain key employees to remain competitive 
certain of our key employees leave or are no longer able to perform services for us  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of managerial personnel and technical employees to compete successfully 
we believe that the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key technical personnel are very important to our continued success 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel 
there are not enough engineers  technical support  software services and managers available to meet the current demands of the computer industry 
we may not be able to retain our key technical and managerial employees or attract  assimilate and retain such other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as are required in the future 
also  employees may leave our employ and subsequently compete against us  or contractors may perform services for competitors of ours 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
x we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and procedures effectively 
we must protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and oem customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary technology 
these steps may not protect our proprietary information nor give us any competitive advantage 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business could be materially harmed 
x we may be adversely affected if we are sued by a third party or if we decide to sue a third party 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us  or to defend us against claimed infringement 
we are also exposed to litigation arising from disputes in the ordinary course of business 
this litigation may divert management s attention away from the operation of our business result in the loss of our proprietary rights subject us to significant liabilities force us to seek licenses from third parties prevent us from manufacturing or selling products any of these results could materially harm our business 
in the course of business  we have in the past received communications asserting that our products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we investigated the factual basis of such communications and negotiated licenses where appropriate 
it is likely that in the course of our business  we will receive similar communications in the future 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our products  or relating to current or future technologies  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
these disputes may not be settled on commercially reasonable terms and may result in long and costly litigation 
x because we sell products internationally  we are subject to additional risks 
sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the period ended june  and of net sales in the year ended june  we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
we make foreign currency denominated sales in many  primarily european  countries 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
in fiscal and beyond  we expect that a majority of our european sales will continue to be denominated in local foreign currency  including the euro 
pinnacle has developed natural hedges for some of this risk in that most of the european operating expenses are also denominated in local currency 
in addition to foreign currency risks  international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks unexpected changes in regulatory requirements export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology political instability trade restrictions changes in tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing international operations potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts we are also subject to the risks of generally poor economic conditions in certain areas of the world  most notably asia 
these risks may harm our future international sales and  consequently  our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currencies the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily the euro and those of germany  france  the uk  and japan 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge local currency activity at any of its foreign locations 
instead  the company believes that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenues substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
the company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
fixed income investments the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio of marketable securities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company invests primarily in us treasury notes and high grade commercial paper and generally holds them to maturity 
consequently  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
the company does  however  limit its exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is two years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue  as well as the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in the company s guidelines  the exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be material
