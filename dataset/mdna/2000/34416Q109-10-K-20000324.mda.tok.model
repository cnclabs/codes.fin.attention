item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
general wilshire real estate investment inc wrei or the company is a nasdaq listed company which invests primarily in the following types of assets o mortgage backed securities  o discounted and non discounted mortgage loans  o real estate  and o other real estate related investments 
we were incorporated on october  and commenced operations on april  following the completion of our initial public offering of approximately million 
in  in response to adverse market conditions and the resulting effect on our operations  we focused our efforts on stabilizing our existing asset base and greatly reduced acquisition activities 
general market conditions and availability of financing for certain of our asset categories  especially subordinated mortgage backed securities and mezzanine loans  continue to be uncertain 
our results of operations for the year ended december  reflect this continued difficult marketplace  which include further impairment write downs of mortgage backed securities  a significant portion of which had previously been deducted from stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   the company had reduced its assets to approximately million and its equity was million 
notwithstanding this uncertainty  we expect to gradually resume acquisition activities with an increased emphasis on investment in mortgage backed securities  loans and related assets and a decreased emphasis on commercial operating properties 
we believe that investments in loans provide higher yields and allow us to more efficiently leverage our existing capital for a given risk tolerance  thereby providing us a higher risk adjusted return on equity 
in addition  we believe there may be attractive opportunities for additional investments in europe 
we may also seek to invest in other companies that invest in real estate related assets  especially where the market capitalizations of such companies do not reflect the inherent values of the underlying assets or franchises 
nonetheless  we continue to make investment decisions on an opportunistic basis and will evaluate investment opportunities as they arise or are developed 
total market valuation losses and impairments recorded in earnings for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
in an effort to increase liquidity and meet current obligations  we have delayed the expected payment date of a per share cash dividend or million in the aggregate originally payable on october  to shareholders of record at september  the company will pay interest  at the rate of per annum  on the amount due calculated from october  through the date of the actual payment 
income tax status in order to take advantage of the significant potential tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards and to avoid the risk of not qualifying as a real estate investment trust reit  we reevaluated our original plan to elect to be taxed as a reit 
our board of directors had been informed that potentially serious adverse tax consequences could result including tax penalties in the event that we elected to be a reit but were unable to qualify as such under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a result of these factors  we concluded that it was in our best interests not to elect reit status 
on september   our shareholders voted not to elect reit status 
since we elected not to be taxed as a reit  we will be subject to corporate taxation 
however  as of december   we had  for us federal tax purposes  a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which begins to expire in us tax regulations impose limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards following certain changes in ownership 
if such a change were to occur with respect to the company  the limitation could significantly reduce the amount of benefits that would be available to offset future taxable income each year starting with the year of the ownership change 
to reduce the potential impact of such ownership changes  the company established a shareholder rights plan dated as of december  and effective january  the company has not recorded any tax assets with respect to the future benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards 
results of operations compared to net loss 
our net loss for the year ended december  amounted to million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended december  the net loss is primarily attributable to million of market valuation losses and impairments compared to million of market valuation losses and impairment and million of provision for loan losses for net interest income 
the following tables set forth information regarding the total amount of income from interest earning assets and expenses from interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average yields and rates for the year ended december  average interest balance income yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios   mortgage backed securities available for sale   other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings   other borrowings  total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread  net interest margin net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
for the year ended december  average interest annualized balance income yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios   mortgage backed securities available for sale   other securities available for sale   due from affiliates  other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities short term borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread  net interest margin although the company was in existence for all of  operations were commenced on april  at the time of the initial public offering 
therefore  rates and yields for the year ended december  are annualized to reflect the company s period of operations from april  to december  net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is annualized based on the period of operations from april to december  for the year ended december   the company recovered million of the allowance for loan losses compared to a provision of million for these amounts are not reflected in the net interest income spread above 
prepayments  delinquencies and defaults affect the net spread of the company  primarily through their impact on mortgage loans that underlie the securities in the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
for principal and interest subordinated mortgage backed securities  which the company generally purchases at a discount to principal amount  increased prepayments recapture such purchase discount sooner and therefore increase spread 
fewer prepayments would have the opposite effect  reducing spread 
for interest only securities ios and residuals  prepayment increases generally reduce spread since these securities derive their value from interest payments on loans that are outstanding 
ios have no principal face amount other than a notional balance and therefore are quite responsive to changes in prepayment 
residuals have both a principal face amount and often a credit related io component 
increased prepayment often reduces spread except to the extent that such prepayment is related to a recovery on a defaulted loan 
the impact on spread  however  depends upon the degree to which prepayment is less than or exceeds the company s assumptions for prepayment at its time of purchase 
the company buys mortgage backed securities based on prepayment  delinquency and default assumptions 
delinquency itself has little effect on spread from the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio since the loan servicers for each security generally advance both principal and interest payments and  therefore  the company generally receives payments on such loans on a timely basis 
more important is the loss severity on defaulted loans 
generally  the larger the loss severity is  the greater the reduction in spread will be 
however  the company s spread is only negatively impacted to the extent the principal face amount of defaults and the cumulative loss severity exceeds or is expected to exceed the company s assumptions at its time of purchase or as subsequently adjusted through a permanent impairment determination 
recapture provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   we reversed a provision for losses of million taken in prior periods for a loan held for sale 
the loan was secured by commercial properties in the united kingdom uk with a carrying value of approximately million 
this valuation allowance had been established in based upon management s estimate at that time of the ultimate recoverability of the asset 
this provision reversal was partially offset by a provision for losses on loans of million 
in addition  we recognized a net write down of million in the carrying value of a million note receivable from wfsg to reflect the estimated value of the common stock of wfsg to be received in exchange for a portion of the note 
total provision for losses for the year ended december  was million  which included a million valuation adjustment of an unsecured million receivable from wfsg and million of loan loss provisions including the provision for the uk loan noted above 
the receivable from wfsg  net of this valuation adjustment  is included in due from wfsg in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  real estate operations 
during the years ended december  and  real estate operating income was comprised primarily of million and million  respectively  in gross rental and other income earned on such investments 
such revenue represents income generated from the company s investment in various office buildings  retail stores  and other commercial property located in oregon  california and the united kingdom 
expenses incurred on such real estate investments include million and million of interest expense  million and million of rental operating expense and million and million of depreciation expense 
other loss 
our other loss was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the components of the company s net non interest loss is comprised of the following market valuation losses and impairments 
the term market valuation losses and impairments as used herein refers to impairment losses recognized primarily on our mortgage backed securities and loan portfolios  as a result of the international economic and financial turmoil which severely affected the market for the company s principal investments beginning in the third quarter of total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
this amount includes million of market valuation losses and impairments related to our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale  million related to our investment in newly issued wfsg stock  million related to fees for advisory services in connection with our investment in wfsg stock and million related to our holdings of wfsg s series b notes prior to their conversion to newly issued wfsg stock 
total market valuation losses and impairments for the year ended december  were million 
of this amount  million was recognized during the third quarter to reflect losses on loans and securities that were i ultimately sold in the fourth quarter to meet collateral calls or to provide liquidity  or ii not sold but were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  resulting from faster than expected loan prepayments or other factors 
during the fourth quarter of  an additional million of market valuation losses and impairments was recorded to reflect additional other than temporary impairment on certain securities and other assets which have not been sold 
of the total million recognized during  million relates to assets sold during the fourth quarter and million relates to assets not sold 
included in the million related to assets not sold is million related to our investment in wfsg s series b notes due  which was converted to newly issued common stock of wfsg following its restructuring 
this loss reflected the write down of this asset to the estimated value of our proportionate share of the equity in the restructured wfsg 
provision for disputes with wfsg 
as discussed in item business  the company decided to become internally managed in the third quarter of and this has resulted in disputes between the company  on the one hand  and wfsg and certain of its affiliates on the other 
in connection with these disputes  the company  without admission  recorded a reserve for potential resolution of disputes with wfsg and its affiliates of million at september  following a partial settlement of disputes with wfsg  the remaining reserve for potential resolution of disputes with wfsg and its affiliates was million at december  gain on the sale of securities 
during the years ended december  and  we sold mortgage backed securities to unrelated third parties for approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in gains of approximately million and million  respectively 
operating expenses 
management fees of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  were comprised solely of the per annum base management fee paid to wrsc as provided pursuant to the management agreement between wrsc and the company 
wrsc earned no incentive fee for these periods 
in addition to the management fee  we incurred loan service fees of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  which were paid to wfsg or an affiliate of wfsg 
the service fee structure is dependent on the assets being serviced  but in general  service fees related to discounted loans are based on a percentage of cash received and service fees related to non discounted loans are based on a percentage of unpaid principal balance 
we prepaid million of future service fees as part of the wfsg and wcc restructuring  although wfsg disputed this amount in the past as well as servicing eligibility for application of the credit  suggesting that the original amount was million 
at december   the balance of the unused prepaid service fees were reduced to million 
see item business 
we also incurred million and million of loan related expenses which were reimbursed to the servicer for actual out of pocket servicing costs 
other expenses were comprised of professional services  insurance premiums and other sundry expenses 
results of operations quarter ended december  compared to quarter ended december  our net income for the quarter ended december  was million  or per share  compared with a loss of million  or per share  for the quarter ended december  net income for was primarily attributable to net interest income of million  income from real estate operations of million  other operating income of million offset by operating expenses of million 
our net loss for the corresponding period was primarily due to market valuation losses and impairments as a result of the market turmoil which occurred in the second half of the following table highlights the results of the quarter quarter ended december  interest income   interest expense   provision for loan losses  net interest income loss after provision for loan losses   real estate operations  net  other operating income loss  operating expenses   income loss before income taxes  income tax benefit net income loss   earnings loss per share basic diluted changes in financial condition during  total assets decreased to million from million at december  this decrease was primarily comprised of the net sales or repayment of the following assets million of securities available for sale  million of investments in real estate and million of loans  discounted loans and loans held for sale 
total liabilities decreased to million during the period  primarily as a result of a decrease of million in short term and other borrowings associated with sales of mortgage backed securities  loans  discounted loans  and investments in real estate 
securities available for sale 
at december   securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities with an aggregate market value of million  net of realized and unrealized losses  compared to million at december  this decrease of million is primarily due to the sale of million of securities  net principal payments received of million and the permanent impairment of securities totaling million which was partially offset by the purchase of million of securities during the fourth quarter of and a decrease in unrealized losses of million 
we mark our securities portfolio to fair value at the end of each month based upon broker dealer valuations  subject to an internal review process 
for those securities that do not have an available market quotation  we request market values and underlying assumptions from the various broker dealers that underwrote the securities  are currently financing the securities  or have had prior experience with the type of securities 
because our subordinated securities may not be readily marketable  as trading activity may be infrequent  the market value is typically available from only a small group of broker dealers  and in many cases  only one broker dealer 
as of each reporting period  we evaluate whether and to what extent any unrealized loss is to be recognized as other than temporary 
loan portfolio 
during the year ended december   we reduced our loan portfolio to approximately million from million at december  this decrease of million is primarily due to the sale of a million loan secured by commercial properties in the united kingdom and the million payoff of a loan to a party in oregon 
at december   approximately million of our non discounted loan portfolio was days or more delinquent  which represented of the portfolio 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that the company considers adequate to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks 
during the year ended december   we recaptured approximately million  net of allowances for loan losses 
discounted loan portfolio 
the carrying value of discounted loans and not unpaid principal balance was approximately million at december   and they were serviced by wfsg or an affiliate of wfsg 
at december   approximately million unpaid principal balance of our discounted loan portfolio was days or more delinquent  which represented of the entire portfolio 
subsequent to december   a discounted loan with an unpaid principal balance of million was paid off in full 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that the company considers adequate to provide for probable losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks 
during the year ended december   no provisions for loan losses had been provided for discounted loans 
investments in real estate 
investments in real estate decreased approximately million during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to sales of an industrial business park located in tigard  oregon for proceeds of approximately million  a commercial warehouse in salem  oregon for proceeds of approximately million  a commercial warehouse in eugene  oregon for proceeds of approximately million and a commercial warehouse and land in valencia  california for proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we recognized approximately million of depreciation expense related to operating properties and recorded a million provision for real estate losses 
we are currently in the process of marketing certain other commercial properties for sale as we continue to reduce our level of investment in commercial real estate income properties to increase liquidity for working capital and reinvestment opportunities 
all of the real estate investments are held for sale effective with the decision to sell all properties on october  short term borrowings 
short term borrowings decreased to approximately million during the year ended december   resulting primarily from the sale of subordinated mortgage backed securities 
interest rates on borrowings under these facilities are generally based on day london interbank offer rate libor rates  plus a spread 
repurchase agreements are secured lending arrangements which involve the borrower selling an asset to a lender at a fixed price with the borrower having an obligation to repurchase the asset within a specified period generally days at a higher price reflecting the interest cost of the loan 
if the value of the underlying asset declines or the lender marks the asset lower  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower generally known as collateral calls 
accordingly  in an environment where lenders consistently mark down the value of the underlying assets  a borrower can become subject to significant collateral calls 
if the borrower does not have sufficient cash to meet the collateral call or additional unencumbered assets to pledge  it may be forced to sell assets to repay the loan 
if the company experiences further downward marks to market of its assets subject to repurchase agreements  it could experience cash collateral calls  thereby reducing liquidity  or be forced to sell further assets  which could result in losses 
other borrowings 
at december   we had million of other borrowings 
of this amount  million financed real estate investments of million and million financed a loan with an unpaid principal balance of million 
other borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased to million during the year ended december  the net decrease in stockholders equity during this period was primarily attributable to a net operating loss of million offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
in addition  the company entered into a partial settlement agreement with wfsg in december which included the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock which reduced stockholders equity by million 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  engage in loan acquisition and lending activities  meet collateral calls and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity during the year ended december  consisted of net cash provided by investing activities  including the cash repayments related to our mortgage backed securities portfolio  a loan receivable which paid off in january  a loan which was sold in april  sales of mortgage backed securities in june and sales of investments in real estate 
the adverse market conditions  which negatively impacted us during the third and fourth quarters of  began to stabilize during  but remained uncertain 
as of december   we had no outstanding collateral calls  compared with collateral calls outstanding as of december  of million 
on october   the company and credit suisse first boston  the company s largest lender  agreed to replace the company s short term monthly repurchase facility with a longer term repurchase facility for the financing of approximately million of subordinated mortgage backed securities and approximately million facility for the financing of a million commercial loan 
the million facility matures in october and becomes increasingly expensive over time 
the million facility finances the starrett lehigh loan and matures on august   unless the starrett lehigh loan is extended  in which case this facility will mature on august  the company believes that this reduces the company s reliance on short term borrowings and eliminated all then outstanding collateral calls 
at december   the company had outstanding financing arrangements with this lender of million for subordinated mortgage backed securities and million for loans 
these facilities require that cash received from the underlying collateral pay down the related debt 
our short term borrowings and the availability of further borrowings are substantially affected by  among other things  changes in interest rates  changes in market spreads whereby the market value of the collateral securing such borrowings may decline substantially  or decreases in credit quality of underlying assets 
in the event of declines in market value or credit quality  we may be required to provide additional collateral for  or repay a portion of outstanding balances of  our short term  floating rate borrowing facilities 
for additional information with respect to our monthly mark to market of our securities available for sale portfolio  see changes in financial condition securities available for sale 
in addition  given the current relative lack of liquidity for below investment grade securities  we intend to maintain a relatively high degree of liquidity 
fluctuations in interest rates will continue to impact our net interest income to the extent our fixed rate assets are funded by variable rate debt or our variable rate assets reprice on a different schedule or in relation to a different index than any floating rate debt which in turn could impact potential returns to shareholders 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at december   we had total consolidated secured indebtedness of million  a reserve relating to the provision for the potential resolution of disputes with wfsg of million  accrued interest payable of million  a dividend payable of million  as well as million of other liabilities 
the consolidated secured indebtedness consisted of i million of repurchase agreements  ii lines of credit aggregating million which are secured by loans and securities and iii million outstanding of other borrowings maturing between and which are secured by real estate and loans 
loans are financed through short term or intermediate term financing facilities 
if the value of the assets securing the loan declines as determined by the lender  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower generally known as collateral calls 
accordingly  in an environment where lenders consistently mark down the value of the underlying assets  a borrower can become subject to collateral calls  which can have a significant impact on liquidity 
similarly  if interest rates increase significantly  the borrowing cost under the financing facility may also increase while the interest rate on the assets securing the loan may not increase at the same time or to the same degree 
real property acquisitions are financed with intermediate or long term mortgages with banks and other financial institutions 
we generally finance acquisitions of mortgage backed securities through committed and uncommitted thirty day repurchase agreements with major wall street investment banks 
repurchase agreements are secured lending arrangements which involve the borrower selling an asset to a lender at a fixed price with the borrower having an obligation to repurchase the asset within a specified period generally days at a higher price reflecting the interest cost of the loan 
if the lender marks the asset lower  the lender may request that the amount of the loan be reduced by cash payments from the borrower or additional collateral be provided by the borrower generally known as collateral calls 
mortgage backed securities which are subject to repurchase agreements  as well as loans which secure other indebtedness  periodically are revalued by the lender  and a decline in the value that is recognized by the lender whether or not the lender recognizes the full fair value of the security may result in the lender requiring us to provide additional collateral to secure the indebtedness 
as of december   the company had approximately million of indebtedness under the terms of which the lender could request additional collateral if the value of the underlying collateral declined including financing facilities for both mortgage backed securities and loans 
although the company believes that the likelihood of significant declines in asset values has decreased since the third quarter of  the company is seeking to maintain a larger cash position and more unencumbered assets to deal with any future potential collateral calls 
in addition  the company is seeking to refinance some of this indebtedness with longer term indebtedness which would not be subject to the same collateral calls 
if we are unable to fund additional collateral requirements or to repay  renew or replace maturing indebtedness on terms reasonably satisfactory to us  we may be required to sell potentially on short notice a portion of our assets  and could incur losses as a result 
furthermore  since from time to time there is extremely limited liquidity in the market for subordinated and residual interests in mortgage related securities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of such securities promptly for fair value in such situations 
based on our monthly interest and other expenses  monthly cash receipts and collateral calls through february   we believe that our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term liquidity needs 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case  however 
material increases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources  collateral calls  or material decreases in monthly cash receipts  generally would negatively impact our liquidity 
on the other hand  material decreases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources  in collateral calls or an increase in market value of our mark to market financial assets generally would positively affect our liquidity 
other year compliance the company and its service providers utilize a number of technologically dependent systems to operate  service mortgage loans and manage mortgage and other related assets 
many existing computer software programs and other technologically dependent systems use two digits to identify the year in date fields and  as such  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year management closely monitored the company s operations subsequent to january  in relation to the year matter and continues to monitor such operations 
the company s information systems were operational with no apparent adverse impact arising as a result of or associated with the year matter 
additionally  the company is not aware of  and has not experienced  any year issues at its key service providers  vendors  mortgage securities servicers  and other third parties 
management considers the risk of any residual potential year matter failures to be minimal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the company s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  the ability of the company to acquire loans  the value of the company s mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  the company s strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the following tables quantify the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value as of december  should interest rates go up or down shocked by to basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and instantaneous 
net portfolio value is calculated as the sum of the value of off balance sheet instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets net of cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities 
the cash flows associated with the loan portfolios and securities available for sale are calculated based on prepayment and default rates that vary by asset but not by changes in interest rates 
projected losses  as well as prepayments  are generated based upon the actual experience with the subject pool  as well as similar  more seasoned pools 
to the extent available  loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history and product types are used to produce the projected loss and prepayment assumptions that are included in the cash flow projections of the securities 
the following tables apply the us treasury yield curve generally for assets and libor for repurchase agreement liabilities and assume a uniform change in both rates 
the tables assume that changes in interest rates occur instantaneously 
the tables also reflect that the company has a significant exposure to libor rates since its short term repurchase agreement borrowings are generally based on libor rates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the tables

the following table sets forth information as to the type of funding used to finance the company s assets as of december  as indicated in the table  a large percentage of the company s fixed rate assets are financed by floating rate liabilities and the company s variable rate assets are generally funded by variable rate liabilities which use the same index

it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
asset and liability management can utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist it in the management of interest rate risk 
for example  in hedging the interest rate and exchange rate exposure of a foreign currency denominated asset or liability  we may enter into hedge transactions to counter movements in the different currencies as well as interest rates in those currencies 
these hedges may be in the form of currency and interest rate swaps  options  and forwards  or combinations thereof 
no such techniques were in use as of december  methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
since different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category

amortizing fixed rate loans are assumed to prepay at a constant prepayment rate cpr of 
at december   we were a party to a swap contract in connection with our investment in a commercial mortgage loan secured by real property in the united kingdom uk 
the swap contract  which covered the approximate five year term of the asset and related financing  was intended to hedge the interest rate basis and currency exposure between uk libor the lending rate and us libor the borrowing rate payments  as well as the principal notional amount of the loan which  as of december   was million 
under the terms of the agreement  the settlement was in us dollars 
the loan and the related swap were disposed of subsequent to december  at december   we were also party to a swap in connection with our investment in real estate in the uk 
the notional amount is gbp  in which we convert floating rate financing to a fixed rate of interest 
subsequent to december   the terms of this swap were incorporated into the refinancing of the related asset  and the company was released as a party to the swap
