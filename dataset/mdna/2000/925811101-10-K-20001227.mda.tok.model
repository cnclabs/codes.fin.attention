new accounting standard not yet adopted the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas and sfas  which will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company s derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
implementation of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency activity the company s foreign exchange exposure is principally limited to the relationship of the us dollar to the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
japanese sourced products denominated in japanese yen accounted for approximately and of product purchases in fiscal and  respectively 
in recent years  the us dollar has weakened in relation to the yen  resulting in increased costs for such products 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on these purchases through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
the company also attempts to reduce the impact of an unfavorable exchange rate condition through cost reductions from its suppliers and shifting product sourcing to suppliers transacting in more stable and favorable currencies 
sales by the company s uk based subsidiary to customers in europe are made in pounds sterling or euros 
in fiscal  approximately million of products were sold by the company to its uk based subsidiary for resale 
since the third quarter of fiscal  the pound and the euro have significantly weakened against the us dollar  thus increasing the cost of us sourced product sold by this subsidiary 
the company attempts to minimize its currency exposure on intercompany sales through the purchase of forward exchange contracts 
in general  the company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate exposures 
however  there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective in limiting foreign currency exposure 
market risk factors the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company has a policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures and minimize the effect of such fluctuations on reported earnings and cash flow see foreign currency activity  note derivative instruments and fair value of financial instruments to the accompanying financial statements 
at september   the company s foreign currency exchange risks included a million intercompany accounts receivable balance due from the company s uk based subsidiary and a nominal japanese yen denominated trade accounts payable liability due to inventory suppliers 
such assets and liabilities are short term and will be settled in fiscal the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at september   a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound would result in a  decrease or increase  respectively  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance 
such foreign currency exchange risk at september  has been substantially hedged by forward exchange contracts 
at september   the company had million of outstanding floating rate bank debt which was covered by interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the foregoing floating rate debt to stated fixed rates see note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
thus  the company has substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments 
however  the company had a total of million of floating rate bank debt  including million of outstanding borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and a million mortgage loan that are subject to interest rate risk as they were not covered by interest rate swap agreements 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company has lessened in recent years as the rate of inflation remains low 
however  inflation continues to increase costs to the company 
as operating expenses and production costs increase  the company seeks price increases to its customers to the extent permitted by market conditions
