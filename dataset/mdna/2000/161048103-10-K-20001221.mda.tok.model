the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
overview we were founded in and opened our first store in carlsbad  california 
by september  we had developed into a regional retailer with stores when two funds owned by saunders karp megrue  lp skm  a private equity investment firm  acquired the business from its founders 
bernard zeichner  who had joined us as president in may  shared skm s belief that a significant opportunity existed to leverage the strength of our new store economics by embarking on a national expansion program 
we undertook several strategic initiatives to establish the necessary infrastructure to support the national expansion including the integration of key senior executives with national retail experience with the existing management team 
in addition  in fiscal we acquired stores in a bankruptcy proceeding from rampage retailing  inc that provided us with a second distinct retail concept and an additional vehicle for growth 
our strong operating performance in fiscal and reflects the benefits of the infrastructure building process that we undertook in fiscal and  as well as the successful execution of our national expansion program for the charlotte russe and rampage chains 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  and store information for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of goodwill and other intangibles operating income interest income expense  net other charges  net income before income taxes and extraordinary item income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss from early debt retirement net income number of stores open at end of period year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
fiscal included weeks of operations while fiscal consisted of weeks 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september   increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the year ended september  this increase is attributable primarily to million of net sales for the new stores opened during fiscal  as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
our comparable store sales increased and contributed million to the net sales increase during fiscal excluding the additional week  total sales increased over the comparable week period of the prior year 
gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million or over last fiscal year 
this increase is the result of higher net sales  offset in part by decreased gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to from 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to higher markdowns  occupancy expenses and inventory shrinkage which were partially offset by higher initial markups and lower freight expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or over last fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to new store expansion  increased corporate expenses and higher marketing expenses 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administration expenses dropped to from  primarily due to the impact of leveraging corporate expenses over a higher sales base 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles expense remained constant at million during fiscal years and income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares to an effective tax rate of for fiscal our effective tax rate exceeds statutory tax rates due to non deductible amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the business in september since amortization is a fixed amount  increases in pre tax earnings reduce the effect of this tax difference as a percentage of pre tax earnings 
net income 
net income increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit  and was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in income taxes  and a million charge relating to the early repayment of the secured bank credit facility 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the same period last year 
this increase is attributable primarily to million of net sales for the new stores opened during fiscal  as well as other stores opened in prior fiscal years that did not qualify as comparable stores 
our comparable store sales increased and contributed million to the net sales increase during fiscal gross profit 
gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold  which includes buying  distribution and occupancy costs 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million or over last fiscal year 
this increase is the result of higher net sales and improved gross profit margins 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit rose to from 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was principally due to higher initial markups  improved inventory shrink expense and the impact of leveraging distribution center expenses over a higher sales base  partially offset by higher markdown expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or over last fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to new store expansion  increased corporate expenses  and a  impairment charge related to the plan to close two stores 
the impairment loss includes  representing the net carrying value of leasehold improvements which will be abandoned and  for estimated unamortized landlord allowances that are refundable upon closure 
employee termination benefits related to the store closures will be insignificant 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administration expenses dropped to from  primarily due to the impact of leveraging store operating expenses and corporate payroll expenses over a higher sales base 
the decline in expenses as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by management bonus plan accruals  for which no comparable charge was incurred during the same period of the prior year 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles expense remained constant at million during fiscal years and income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares to an effective tax rate of for fiscal our effective tax rate exceeds statutory tax rates due to non deductible amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the business in september since amortization is a fixed amount  increases in pre tax earnings reduce the effect of this tax difference as a percentage of pre tax earnings 
net income 
net income increased to million from million  an increase of million or over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit  and was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in income taxes  and a million charge relating to the early repayment of the subordinated debt in june quarterly results and seasonality we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by strong sales during the back to school  easter and winter holiday seasons 
the strength of each of these three seasons generally provides relatively balanced sales during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the second fiscal quarter ending in march of each year 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays  as well as other factors discussed in the section entitled risks relating to our business 
the following table includes our unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the four quarters in the fiscal years ended september  and september  the fourth quarter of fiscal included weeks of operations while all other quarters in fiscal and consisted of weeks 
we believe that this information has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in the annual report

we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
due to the rapid turnover of our inventory  we generate trade payables and other accrued liabilities sufficient to offset our working capital requirements  and this allows us to operate with negative working capital 
as of september   we had a working capital deficit of million 
during fiscal years  and  net cash provided by operations was million  million and million 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of increased operating earnings and increased current liabilities 
in fiscal cash used in investing activities included million related to the acquisition of stores from rampage retailing  inc cash used for new store openings and the construction of our distribution center and corporate facility was million  million and million in fiscal  and excluding the impact of financing activities related to the rampage acquisition  the net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations was million in fiscal and net borrowings of million in during fiscal  we repaid million of our subordinated debt to the skm funds  although net borrowings under our revolving credit facility rose only million during the same period 
in fiscal  we repaid the remaining million balance under the revolving credit facility using the million net proceeds of our initial public offering and operational cash flows 
based on our experience with store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open a new store is approximately  which includes capital expenditures  net of landlord contributions  and initial inventory  net of payables 
during the first year of operations  our new stores opened during fiscal years through generated store level operating cash flow in excess of  representing an average cash return on investment greater than although there can be no assurance that our new stores will obtain these levels in fiscal years after after taking into account store remodeling  corporate capital projects and distribution center enhancements  total capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to be approximately million 
our unsecured revolving credit facility with bankboston  na  as agent  provides us with a million revolving line of credit under which borrowed funds bear interest at either the bank s eurodollar rate plus or the bank s base rate at our option  subject to certain adjustments 
at september   no outstanding balance existed under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios such as total liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  fixed charges coverage  and minimum net worth 
we believe that cash flows from operations  current cash balance and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated capital expenditure requirements for fiscal if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly  or if we should accelerate our store expansion program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
forward looking statements we have made statements under the captions  business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and risks relating to our business  as well as in other sections of this annual report  that are forward looking statements 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  intend  anticipate  believe  estimate and continue or similar words 
these forward looking statements may also use different phrases 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements  which are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about us  may include  among other things  projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition  our anticipated growth strategies  and general and regional economic conditions  industry trends  consumer demands and preferences  competition from other retailers and uncertainties generally associated with women s apparel and accessory retailing 
there may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or which we do not fully control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
because these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements  including shopping mall traffic and shopping patterns  timing of openings for new shopping malls or our stores  fashion trends  national or regional economic influences  and weather 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this annual report might not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate pegged to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of september   we had no borrowings against our credit facility  however  we may borrow additional funds under our facility as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
risks relating to our business 
we will be opening new stores more rapidly than we have in the past  which could strain our resources and cause us to execute our business less effectively 
our growth will largely be dependent on successfully opening and operating new stores 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  including stores in the fourth quarter 
the addition of stores in fiscal represented an increase of approximately from the number of stores open at the end of fiscal we plan to open at least new stores during fiscal  an increase of at least from the end of fiscal we intend to continue to increase our number of stores at approximately this rate for at least the next few years 
our managerial and operational resources were significantly strained during our acquisition of the rampage stores in fiscal our proposed expansion is more rapid than what we have experienced in the past  including the rampage acquisition  and will place increased demands on our managerial  operational and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to execute our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores and slow our new store growth 
our planned expansion involves a number of risks that could prevent or delay the successful opening of new stores as well as impact the performance of our existing stores 
our ability to open and operate new stores successfully depends on many factors  including  among others  our ability to identify suitable store locations  negotiate acceptable lease terms  including desired tenant improvement allowances  source sufficient levels of inventory to meet the needs of new stores  hire and train store personnel  successfully integrate new stores into our existing operations  and satisfy the fashion preferences of new geographic areas 
in addition  many of our new stores will be opened in regions of the united states and its territories in which we currently have few or no stores 
the expansion into new markets may present competitive  merchandising and distribution challenges that are different from those currently encountered in our existing markets 
any of these challenges could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent our new store openings are in existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets 
our stores are heavily dependent on the customer traffic generated by shopping malls 
most of our store locations are not sufficiently concentrated to make significant marketing expenditures cost effective 
as a result  we depend heavily on locating our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls in order to generate customer traffic 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls  or the success of individual shopping malls 
if at any time our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations decline or do not meet the expectations of research analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
our quarterly results of operations for our individual stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for instance  while quarterly comparable store sales increased at least in each quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced quarterly comparable store sales increases of or less in each of the three subsequent quarters 
our net sales and operating results are typically lower in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings and the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  fashion trends  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  the effectiveness of our test and reorder strategy in maintaining appropriate inventory levels  changes in our merchandise mix  timing of promotional events  general economic conditions and  in particular  the retail sales environment  actions by competitors or mall anchor tenants  weather conditions  and the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores 
our business and reputation may be adversely affected if our rampage stores are associated with negative publicity related to the use of the rampage trademark by other parties 
in connection with the acquisition of our rampage stores  we acquired the exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark for use on exterior or interior signages identifying our rampage stores as well as the non exclusive right within the united states to use the rampage trademark for promotional and advertising materials 
we do not  however  have the right to use the rampage trademark on our merchandise 
the right to market merchandise under the rampage trademark was retained by rampage clothing company 
further  nothing in our license agreement with rampage clothing company prohibits the sale of merchandise bearing the rampage trademark by other parties or the licensing of the rampage trademark to other parties 
in fact  rampage clothing company has licensed the trademark to other parties 
we believe a positive rampage brand image is important to our success 
accordingly  if the merchandise sold by the rampage clothing company or other parties under the rampage trademark is of low quality or if the rampage clothing company or these parties otherwise engage in activities that negatively affect the rampage trademark or are otherwise inconsistent with our rampage store concept  consumers could lose confidence in our merchandise and our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to identify and rapidly respond to consumers fashion tastes 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
accordingly  our success is heavily dependent both on the priority our target customers place on fashion and on our ability to anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
current fashion tastes place significant emphasis on a fashionable look 
in the past this emphasis has increased and decreased through fashion cycles  and decreased emphasis has adversely affected our results 
although we rely on a test and reorder merchandise strategy to minimize our exposure to misjudging fashion tastes and to reduce inventory risks  we have no assurance you that this strategy will continue to be successful 
our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles  trends  desired images or brand preferences could lead to  among other things  excess inventories and higher markdowns  as well as decreased appeal of our brands 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
we operate in a highly competitive environment characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national and local specialty retail stores  regional retail chains  traditional department stores and  to a lesser extent  mall merchandisers 
our market share and results of operations may be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
many of our competitors also are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
we rely on our good relationships with vendors to implement our business strategy successfully 
our business is dependent on continued good relations with our vendors 
in particular  we believe that we generally are able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors because we are perceived as a desirable customer 
our test and reorder merchandise strategy also relies in large part on our ability to obtain merchandise from our vendors within three to six weeks from the date of order 
our failure to maintain good relations with our vendors could increase our exposure to changing fashion cycles  which may in turn lead to increased inventory markdown rates 
our southwestern united states concentration makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region 
a majority of our stores are located in the southwest 
as a result  our operations are more subject to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  economic and weather conditions  demographic and population changes and fashion tastes 
in addition  our corporate offices and distribution center are located in san diego  and we transact business with vendors at our offices in the californiamart in los angeles 
a natural disaster or other catastrophic event  such as an earthquake  affecting southern california could significantly disrupt our operations 
our failure to retain our existing senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization in order to timely deliver and display fashionable merchandise in appropriate quantities in our stores 
this execution requires experienced and talented management 
we currently have a management team with a great deal of experience with us and in apparel retailing 
if we were to lose the benefit of this experience  and in particular if we were to lose the services of bernard zeichner  our president and chief executive officer  or harriet sustarsic  our executive vice president and general merchandise manager  our business could be adversely affected 
we do not have employment agreements with any member of our senior management team other than mr 
zeichner 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our management team 
we rely on third parties for upgrading and maintaining our management information systems 
if these third parties do not adequately perform these functions appropriately  our business could be disrupted 
the efficient operation of our business is heavily dependent on our information systems 
in particular  we rely heavily on the automated sortation system used in our distribution center and the merchandise management system used to track sales and inventory 
we depend on our vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade these systems for the continued ability of these systems to support our business as we expand 
the software programs supporting our automated sorting equipment and processing our inventory management information were licensed to us by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers to continue to maintain and upgrade these software programs would disrupt our operations if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner
