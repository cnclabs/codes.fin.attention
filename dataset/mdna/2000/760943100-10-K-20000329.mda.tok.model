item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview res care  inc rescare or the company receives revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  education and support services to populations with special needs 
the company has three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii job corps program  and iii other youth services programs 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment follows 
further information regarding each of these segments  including the required disclosure of certain segment financial information  is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
such disclosures are incorporated herein by reference and should be read in conjunction with this item 
revenues for the company s disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state government agencies under the medicaid reimbursement system and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid system 
reimbursement methods vary by state and are typically based on a flat rate or cost based reimbursement system on a per person  per diem basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based primarily upon historical costs experienced by the company and by other service providers  and on inflation 
at facilities and programs where it is the provider of record  the company is directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services it provides and such reimbursement is affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that the company operates pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated based upon the reimbursement amount expected to be earned by the provider of record  which is affected by occupancy levels 
under certain management contracts  the company is paid a fixed fee regardless of occupancy levels 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies with respect to medicaid contracts 
the company operates vocational training programs under the federal job corps program administered by the united states department of labor dol 
under the job corps program  the company is reimbursed for direct costs related to job corps center operations and allowable indirect costs for general and administrative expenses  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program expenses 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program expenses 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
in  the company began operating other programs for at risk and troubled youths through its youthtrack youthtrack and alternative youth services ays subsidiaries 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies including school systems 
under these contracts  the company is typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for disabilities services  job corps and other youth services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
any resulting adjustments would be recorded as contractual adjustments to revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments may be announced by the various states inconsistently and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
the company expects that future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments 
however  in some cases states have revised their rate setting methodologies  which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
current initiatives at the federal or state level may materially change the medicaid system as it now exists 
retroactively calculated contractual adjustments are estimated and accrued in the periods the related services are rendered and recorded as adjustments in future periods as final adjustments are received 
because the cumulative effect of rate adjustments may differ from previously estimated amounts  net income as a percentage of revenues for a period in which an adjustment occurs may not be indicative of expected results in succeeding periods 
future revenues may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where the company operates 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  the company cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed 
recent developments in february  the company announced that it received a proposal  which was subsequently withdrawn  for a management led group to acquire all the company s outstanding shares of common stock through a merger at a price of per share in cash 
the proposal was made by a group  which included members of the company s management and three equity investment funds 
prior to execution of the definitive agreements for the transaction  the group withdrew its proposal when the lead equity investment fund decided not to proceed with the transaction because of its concern about the availability of debt financing at acceptable rates in light of current conditions in the credit markets 
representatives of management and the two remaining investment funds have indicated to the company their desire to continue negotiations regarding a possible transaction 
a special committee of the board of directors was formed to negotiate and evaluate any possible transaction 
the special committee is being advised by jc bradford co 
there can be no assurance that discussions regarding a possible transaction will continue  that any new offer will be made to the company  or that any transaction will ultimately be consummated

through december   approximately million of the charge had been utilized through million in cash payments principally severance and transaction costs and million in asset write downs relating principally to the discontinued peopleserve information systems

interest income in increased  to million from million for this increase was due primarily to interest earned on the investment of proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in november and december income taxes increased to million in compared to million in  and reflect effective tax rates of and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital is attributable primarily to the company s plans to expand through the development of new facilities and programs and selected acquisitions  and the working capital required for general corporate purposes 
since most of the company s facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates received by the company  the company s ability to continue to grow at its current rate is directly dependent upon such expansion 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for and million for the decrease in from was due primarily to a growth in accounts receivable as well as declines in the growth of current liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily related to the increased number of acquisitions made during and  as well as delays in payment from certain medicaid programs and the integration of acquired operations 
the decrease in from was due primarily to an increase in income from continuing operations  trade payables and accrued expenses  offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily related to the increased number of acquisitions made during during the years ended december   and  cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  relating primarily to acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million for  related primarily to borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  related primarily to the issuance of convertible subordinated notes  offset by repayment of the line of credit 
cash provided by financing activities was million for consisting primarily of borrowings against the line of credit 
as of december   the company had million available on its line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
outstanding at that date were irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued in connection with workers compensation insurance and certain facility leases 
net days revenue in accounts receivable  including the million additional provision for doubtful accounts discussed above  was days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  accounts receivable at december   increased to million  compared to million at december   and million at december  growth in these amounts from to has been primarily related to delays in payment from certain state medicaid programs and the integration of acquired operations 
the company has historically sought to provide its services in leased premises  especially in the case of larger facilities 
however  the company has increased its real estate purchases  particularity residential homes  in response to changes in certain reimbursement methodologies primarily related to its expansion of services provided to consumers in community based settings 
further  when cost effective  the company may exercise options to purchase real estate available under the terms of certain of its leasing arrangements 
in the first quarter of  the company expects to exercise its option under a lease arrangement to purchase approximately million in real estate 
also  acquisitions may involve the purchase of real estate 
the company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from its operating cash flow and utilization of its credit facility 
cash requirements for the acquisition of new business operations have generally been funded through a combination of cash generated from operating activities  utilization of the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of long term obligations and common stock 
current conditions in the capital markets  especially for companies identified as health care related  have limited the company s ability to raise significant amounts of expansion capital 
as a result  the company s growth rate going forward  with its emphasis on internally generated growth  is expected to be lower than in recent years when acquisitions produced higher growth rates 
the company is exploring other sources of capital  including a sale leaseback of its owned real estate properties  and believes such sources in addition to cash generated from operations and amounts remaining available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements in  in light of the company s reduced growth rate 
certain risk factors the company s growth in revenues has been directly related to a considerable increase in the number of individuals served in each of its operating segments 
this growth has been largely dependent upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities or of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or not for profit organizations and the extension or renewal of contracts previously awarded to the company 
as discussed above  the company s ability to raise additional capital to support such development driven activities  particularly acquisitions  is currently limited 
for this reason and as a result of the company s emphasis on internal growth as discussed above  the company expects its growth over the next twelve months to be lower than the rates achieved in recent years 
the company s future revenues will depend significantly upon the company s ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the special needs populations it serves  whether through selected acquisitions or awards in response to requests for proposals for new programs or in connection with facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  which do not require significant outlays of capital 
future revenues also depend on the company s ability to maintain and renew its existing services contracts and its existing leases 
changes in the market for acquisitions and contracts  including increasing competition and the cost to transition or implement these acquisitions or awarded contracts  could also adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
revenues of the company s disabilities services segment are highly dependent on reimbursement under federal and state medicaid programs 
generally  each state has its own medicaid reimbursement regulations and formula 
the company s revenues and operating profitability are dependent upon its ability to maintain its existing reimbursement levels and to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates 
changes in the manner in which medicaid reimbursement rates are established or reviewed in one or more of the states in which the company conducts its operations could adversely affect revenues and profitability 
other changes in the manner in which federal and state reimbursement programs are operated  and in the manner in which billings costs are reviewed and audited  could also affect revenues and operating profitability 
as discussed above  following discussions with various state agencies and clarification obtained regarding certain aspects of state billing procedures  the company increased its reserve for doubtful accounts by approximately million reflecting a revision of its previous estimate regarding the collectibility of certain older accounts 
management has taken steps to address this issue  including implementing a new comprehensive accounts receivable system to replace its existing systems 
management believes this will enable it to more effectively track and manage its accounts receivable 
the failure to properly manage its account balances could adversely affect the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the company s cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are significantly dependent on its labor costs and the availability and utilization of its labor force and thus may be affected by a variety of factors  including local competitive forces  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  the company s effectiveness in managing its direct service staff  and changes in consumer services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
as discussed above  the difficulty experienced in hiring direct service staff in certain markets is expected to result in higher labor costs in certain operating units of the company 
additionally  the company s continued maintenance and expansion of its operations are dependent upon continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation and the company s ability to tailor its services to meet the specific needs of the populations it serves 
the success in operating in a changing environment is subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures  including desires of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of the company s services and its operating flexibility  and ultimately its revenues and profitability 
from time to time  the company or a provider with which the company has a management agreement  is a party to legal and or administrative proceedings involving state program administrators and others that  in the event of unfavorable outcomes  may adversely affect revenues and period to period comparisons 
in addition  the company is a party to various legal proceedings encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that many of such legal proceedings are without merit 
further  such claims may be covered by insurance 
the company does not believe the results of such proceedings or litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity
