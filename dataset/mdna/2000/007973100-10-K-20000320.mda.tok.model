as a result  our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or prove any forward looking statements  by hindsight  to be overly optimistic or unachievable  include  but are not limited to the following o the significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  o the volatility of the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries  o timing and success of integration of recent and potential future acquisitions  and o supply constraints and technological changes 
for a discussion of these and other factors that may impact our realization of our forward looking statements  see part i cautionary statements risk factors 
overview we design  manufacture and support power conversion and control systems 
these systems are important components of industrial manufacturing equipment that modifies surfaces or deposits or etches thin film layers on computer chips  cds  flat panel displays such as computer screens  dvds  windows  eyeglasses and other products 
we market and sell our systems primarily to large global oems of semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing equipment and for manufacturers of other products in emerging markets 
a substantial proportion of our sales are made on a just in time basis in which the shipment of systems occurs within a few days or hours after an order is received 
we recognize revenues upon shipment of our systems and there is no requirement for acceptance when a product is shipped 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry accounted for approximately of our sales in  in and in we have been successful in achieving a number of design wins each year  which have resulted in our obtaining new customers and solidifying relationships with our existing customers 
we believe our ability to continue to achieve design wins with existing and potential customers will be critical to our future success 
we continue to seek to expand our product offerings and customer base through internal development and acquisitions 
in may we acquired the assets of mik physics  inc this acquisition provided the base technology for our astral products  which are high power direct current dc systems used in pvd equipment 
in august we acquired tower electronics 
this acquisition expanded our technology and customer base  and provided us with the capability to design and manufacture power conversion systems for use in modems  non impact printers  telephone switches and laser devices 
in october we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in that same month we also completed formation of our wholly owned sales and service subsidiary in south korea 
we took another step towards achieving further market penetration in september when we acquired the assets of fourth state technology 
this acquisition enhanced our capability to design and manufacture rf power related process control systems used to monitor and analyze data in thin film etch processes 
in october we acquired rf power products  which designs  manufactures and supports rf power conversion and control systems  consisting of generators and matching networks 
we believe our ability to offer an expanded line of rf systems to our existing customer base has strengthened those relationships 
we sell these products principally to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers 
we also sell similar systems to capital equipment manufacturers in the flat panel display and thin film data storage industries  and are exploring applications for these products in other industries 
in april we changed the name of rf power products to advanced energy voorhees  inc and conduct business under that name 
in october we acquired a majority interest in litmas  a company that designs and manufactures plasma gas abatement systems and high density plasma sources 
we believe that litmas current and future products will expand our product offerings to our existing and potential customers in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
in november we completed two underwritten public offerings  one for million of convertible subordinated notes  and one for  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
these offerings provided aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
in december we completed formation of our wholly owned sales and service subsidiary in taiwan

we also sell spare parts and repair services worldwide through our customer service and technical support organization 
sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to our sales decrease from to resulted from decreased unit sales of our systems  while the increase from to was due to increased unit sales 
we started the year with strong sales growth to semiconductor capital equipment customers  which followed the downturn in that industry that had resulted from excess production capacity of semiconductor manufacturers and sharply decreased memory device prices 
toward the end of  after a relatively strong recovery  the semiconductor capital equipment industry  affected primarily by the asian financial crisis  began a sudden and severe downturn  which continued through this caused a decrease in our sales to this industry in when compared to  and resulted in lower sales to the united states and the asia pacific region 
sales to the data storage industry decreased  although sales to our largest customer in that industry grew significantly from to  resulting in higher sales to europe 
sales to emerging markets were slightly higher  but would have been lower if not for the full year effect of sales by tower in our experience has shown that our sales to semiconductor capital equipment customers has been dependent on the volatility of that industry  as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand  and rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
a substantial portion of our sales growth from to was due to higher system sales to four of our largest customers  three of whom are primarily semiconductor capital equipment oems  and one of whom is a data storage oem 
our sales in reflected the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry from the severe downturn of  and resulted from capacity expansion and increased investment in advanced technology by the semiconductor industry 
this recovery and expansion resulted in record sales for us in it also resulted in record sales for us to the semiconductor capital equipment industry specifically 
our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry in increased over sales to that industry in  and resulted in higher sales within the united states 
sales to the data storage industry increased from to  and resulted in higher sales to europe 
sales to the flat panel display industry increased from to  and resulted in higher sales to the asia pacific region  particularly to japan 
sales to emerging industries decreased  primarily due to decreased sales by our tower subsidiary 
the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by customer type for us for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands semiconductor capital equipment    data storage    flat panel display    emerging    customer service technical support    years ended december  semiconductor capital equipment data storage flat panel display emerging customer service technical support the following tables summarize annual net sales  and percentages of net sales  by geographic region for us for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  in thousands united states and canada    europe    asia pacific    rest of world years ended december  united states and canada europe asia pacific rest of world gross margin our gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of significant capacity expansion in and the reduced level of sales in the improvement in gross margin from to was primarily a result of our efforts to reduce material costs  improve overhead cost controls and a more favorable absorption of manufacturing costs from the higher sales base 
during the first quarter of we relocated and expanded the voorhees  new jersey facility 
in the fourth quarter of we expanded into a new manufacturing facility in fort collins  colorado 
in the second quarter of we relocated part of our previously existing fort collins manufacturing operations to a new facility in austin  texas 
we intended the three new facilities to serve existing and anticipated growth in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the expansion to the new location in austin was to provide service specifically to our largest customer  a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer  whose primary manufacturing facilities are in austin 
in the fourth quarter of the semiconductor capital equipment industry entered a sudden and severe downturn which continued through the end of the downturn in this industry  with the resulting underutilization of capacity  significantly impacted our financial results for the combination of the expansion and lower sales resulted in an over capacity situation for us  leading to unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and a substantially reduced margin 
this underutilization of manufacturing capacity continued to negatively impact gross margins  until sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market began to recover in historically  price competition has not had a material effect on margins 
however  competitive pressures may produce a decline in average selling prices for certain products 
any decline in average selling prices not offset by reduced costs could result in a decline in our gross margins 
we provide warranty coverage for our systems ranging from to months  and estimate the anticipated costs of repairing our systems under such warranties based on the historical average costs of the repairs 
to date  we have not experienced significant warranty costs in excess of our recorded reserves 
research and development we invest in research and development to research new technologies  develop new products and improve existing product designs 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of from to and from to as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from in to in because of the lower sales base  but decreased to in because of the higher sales base 
the increase in expenses from to is primarily due to increases in payroll  materials and supplies  and higher infrastructure costs for new product development 
in connection with the acquisition of tower in august  we recorded a one time charge of million in for the portion of the purchase price attributable to in process research and development 
this one time charge is not included in the million reported for research and development expense in we believe continued research and development investment for development of new systems is critical to our ability to serve new and existing markets 
since our inception  research and development costs generally have been internally funded and all have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses support domestic and international sales and marketing activities which include personnel  trade shows  advertising  and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
this represented a increase from to and from to the increases are attributable to higher payroll costs incurred as we continue to increase our sales management and product management capabilities 
additionally  we increased spending in to develop worldwide applications engineering capabilities 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses increased from in to in because of the lower sales base but decreased to in because of the higher sales base 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses support our worldwide financial  administrative  information systems and human resources functions 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses from to is primarily due to cost control measures implemented in  and the increase from to is primarily due to higher spending for payroll and purchased services 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase from to was due to the lower sales base  while the decrease from to was due to the higher sales base 
we continue to implement our management system software  including the replacement of existing systems in our domestic and foreign locations 
we expect that charges related to training and implementation of the new software will continue through one time charges and credits we took one time net charges totaling million in included was a net charge of million for storm damage to our headquarters and main manufacturing facilities that resulted from heavy rains in the fort collins area in july we settled with our insurance carrier in  which resulted in a million recovery we recorded in the fourth quarter of as discussed above in research and development  the acquisition of tower resulted in a charge of million in for purchased in process research and development  which is nondeductible for income tax purposes 
in addition to the settlement for storm damage  we took one time charges totaling million in in august we announced a restructuring plan to respond to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
the plan included a reduction of workforce of people  the closure of one facility in our fort collins  colorado campus  and the abandonment of plans to construct a new manufacturing facility in fort collins 
we achieved other reductions in workforce at the voorhees facility throughout we took a one time charge of million for the restructuring in the third quarter of on october   advanced energy acquired rf power products  in a pooling of interests that involved the exchange of four million shares of advanced energy common stock for the publicly held common stock of rf power products 
as part of the business combination  we incurred million of expense recorded in the fourth quarter of we incurred additional operating expenses during relating to consolidating and integrating operations of this business combination 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
interest income was approximately million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
in and  interest income was earned primarily from earnings on investments made from the proceeds of our initial public offering in and our underwritten public offering in in interest income was earned primarily from the proceeds of our offering of convertible subordinated debt and common stock offering of november interest expense consists principally of accruals of interest on our convertible subordinated notes  on borrowings under our bank credit and capital lease facilities and a state government loan 
interest expense was approximately million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the increase of interest expense from to was primarily due to interest on the convertible subordinated notes 
our foreign subsidiaries sales are primarily denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we recorded net foreign currency gains of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to strengthening of the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar 
beginning in  we entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various policies to minimize the effect of foreign currency fluctuations 
eleven european countries have adopted a single european currency the euro as of january  with a transition period continuing through january  as of january   these eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
for three years after the introduction of the euro  the participating countries can perform financial transactions in either the euro or their original local currencies 
this will result in a fixed exchange rate among the participating countries  whereas the euro and the participating countries currencies in tandem will continue to float freely against the us dollar and other currencies of non participating countries 
although we do not expect the introduction of the euro currency to have a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations  we are unable to determine what effects  if any  the currency change in europe will have on competition and competitive pricing in the affected regions 
provision benefit for income taxes the income tax provision for was million and represented an effective tax rate of 
the income tax benefit of million for represented an effective rate of 
the income tax provision of million in represented an effective rate of 
the lower rate of the tax benefit in was due to nondeductible costs associated with advanced energy s acquisition of rf power products  and foreign operating losses with no benefit recorded 
changes in our relative earnings and the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries affect our consolidated effective tax rate 
we adjust our income taxes periodically based upon the anticipated tax status of all foreign and domestic entities 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly results in dollars and as a percentage of sales for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

minority interest in net income net income loss we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results may be adversely affected 
a variety of factors have an influence on the level of our revenues in a particular quarter 
these factors include o general economic conditions  o specific economic conditions in the industries we serve  o timing and receipt of orders from major customers  o customer cancellations or delays of shipments  o specific feature requests by customers  o production delays or manufacturing inefficiencies  o exchange rate fluctuations  o management decisions to commence or discontinue product lines  o our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis  o the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  o the timing of research and development expenditures  and o expenses related to acquisitions  strategic alliances  and the further development of marketing and service capabilities 
we make a substantial portion of our shipments on a just in time basis in which shipment of systems occurs within a few days or hours after we receive an order 
our backlog is not meaningful because of the importance of just in time shipments 
we are dependent on obtaining orders for shipment in a particular quarter to achieve our revenue objectives for that quarter 
accordingly  it is difficult for us to predict accurately the timing and level of sales in a particular quarter 
due to our just in time program  we anticipate quarterly fluctuations in sales to continue to occur 
our quarterly operating results in and reflect the changing demand for our products during this period  principally from manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment and data storage equipment and emerging markets  and our ability to adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet this demand 
demand from the semiconductor capital equipment companies entered a sudden and severe downturn at the end of  which continued throughout  but which recovered slowly throughout sales to the data storage industry declined from the first quarter of to the second quarter of  then increased in the third quarter of but dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of data storage sales then increased throughout  except for a slight decrease in the second quarter 
sales to the flat panel display industry decreased from the first quarter of to the second quarter of  and decreased again from the second quarter of to the third quarter of  then increased in each of the next five quarters 
sales to emerging markets were lower in the second half of when compared to the first half of  were lower again in the first half of  then increased in the second half of our gross margin fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis in and  primarily reflecting utilization of manufacturing capacity 
the decrease in gross margin from to from the first quarter of to the second quarter of was due to decreased utilization of capacity resulting from the decrease in sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
gross margin improved to in the third quarter of even though there was a decrease in sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry and decreased utilization of capacity 
the improvement was due to our efforts to lower material costs through supplier contract negotiations while improving material quality and material handling efficiency  as well as from cost improvements realized from the restructuring 
gross margin declined to in the fourth quarter of  due primarily to another decrease in sales to the semiconductor capital equipment industry that resulted in decreased utilization of capacity  although material costs improved due to efforts continued from the previous quarter 
gross margin then improved to in the first quarter of  to in the second and third quarters of and to in the fourth quarter of these increases were due to increased utilization of capacity from the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and from our increased efforts to lower material costs 
due to the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry in  we held operating expenses  excluding one time charges and credits  relatively flat during the first half of in anticipation of an early recovery 
operating expenses were million and million in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
with the extent and duration of the downturn still uncertain  in the second half of we reduced operating expenses  excluding one time charges and credits  while maintaining a minimum level of resources necessary to address an upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that began to occur during operating expenses in the third and fourth quarters of were million and million  respectively  and would have been million and million  respectively  if not for one time charges and credits 
operating expenses were million  million  million and million during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  but declined as a percentage of sales throughout as the sales base increased each quarter 
as a percentage of sales  operating expenses have declined during periods of rapid sales growth  when sales increased at a rate faster than our ability to add personnel and facilities to support the growth 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales have increased during periods of flat or decreased sales  when our infrastructure is retained to support anticipated future growth 
other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency gain and loss 
interest income and expense were relatively stable throughout the periods presented  until the fourth quarter of  when the interest income and expense from the proceeds of the convertible subordinated notes and the interest from the proceeds of the common stock sale began 
during we recorded a net foreign exchange gain of million  earned primarily in the fourth quarter of that year 
during we recorded a net foreign exchange gain of million  which occurred mostly in the second half of the year 
we continue to utilize forward foreign exchange contracts in japan to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
our effective rate for income tax provision benefit fluctuated significantly throughout  varying from to 
the fluctuations were due to certain nondeductible expenses including merger costs and losses in foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recorded 
our effective income tax rate became more stable in  varying from to 
we have implemented certain business strategies which we believe will favorably impact our effective income tax rate in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations  acquired equipment and met our working capital requirements through borrowings under our revolving line of credit  long term loans secured by property and equipment  cash flow from operations  proceeds from underwritten public offerings of our common stock and proceeds from convertible subordinated debt 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of depreciation  amortization and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by net loss  decreases in income taxes payable  accounts payable and payroll 
operating activities provided cash of million in  primarily as a result of net income  depreciation  amortization  increases in accounts payable and increased accruals for payroll  employee benefits and income taxes  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
we expect future receivable and inventory balances to fluctuate with net sales 
we provide just in time deliveries to certain of our customers and may be required to maintain higher levels of inventory to satisfy our customers delivery requirements 
any increase in our inventory levels will require the use of cash to finance the inventory 
investing activities in used cash of million and included the purchase of property and equipment of million  the acquisition of the assets of fourth state technology for million and the initial investment in litmas of million  offset by a net decrease in marketable securities of million 
investing activities in used cash of million and included a net increase in marketable securities of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and an additional investment in litmas of million 
financing activities used cash of million in and consisted primarily of changes in notes payable and capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in  and consisted primarily of net proceeds from convertible subordinated debt of million  net proceeds from the sale of common stock of million  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million  and other items of million 
we plan to spend approximately million in for the acquisition of equipment  leasehold improvements and furnishings  with depreciation expense projected to be million 
as of december   we had working capital of million 
our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  and a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit which replaced our prior line of credit  with options to convert up to million to a three year term loan 
advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at either the prime rate at february  minus or the libor day rate at february  plus basis points  at our option 
all advances under this revolving line of credit will be due and payable in december as of december  there was an advance outstanding of million to our japanese subsidiary  advanced energy japan kk additionally  we guarantee a  bank term loan through march   entered into by a non public entity that serves as a supplier to us 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and available borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through at least the end of after that time  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital  capital equipment or expansion needs 
in addition  any significant acquisitions we make may require additional equity or debt financings to fund the purchase price  if paid in cash 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when required or that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
year program we did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in our operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   we do not expect any significant impact to our ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues may occur with billing  payroll  or financial closings at the end of a month  quarter or year 
we have not experienced any such problems to date and we believe that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  we could still be negatively impacted if the year or similar issues adversely affect our customers or suppliers 
we currently are not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for our customers and suppliers 
the foregoing beliefs and expectations are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
these are based in large part on certain statements and representations made by persons other than us  any of which statements or representations ultimately could prove to be inaccurate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy are averse to principal loss and seek to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   our investments consisted of commercial paper  municipal bonds and notes and mutual funds 
our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates with respect to our bank facility of which million was outstanding as of december  our other debt  including our convertible subordinated notes  is fixed rate in nature and mitigates the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value of our debt approximates the carrying amount at december  we believe the potential effects of near term changes in interest rates on our debt is not material 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are generated in countries in asia and europe 
we have entered into various forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against currency fluctuations in the japanese yen 
we will continue to evaluate various methods to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations 
at december   we held foreign forward exchange contracts with nominal amounts of  and market settlement amounts of  for an unrealized gain position of other risk we have invested in a start up company and may in the future make additional investments in start up companies that develop products which we believe may provide future benefits 
the current start up investment and any future start up investments will be subject to all of the risks inherent in investing in companies that are not established
