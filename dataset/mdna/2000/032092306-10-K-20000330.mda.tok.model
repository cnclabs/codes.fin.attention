strategic repositioning of the company beginning in  the company began a strategic repositioning by building a network of internet video businesses  focusing on programming  services and technology 
during the past year the company  through its subsidiary  inextv  acquired equity interests in various internet video businesses and started to assemble its internal organization to support the inextv network and to develop additional internet video based websites 
in february  in order to focus more sharply on its internet video businesses  the company announced plans to sell data systems  its subsidiary which makes high performance tape based mass data storage products 
the results of operations of data systems have been classified as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for all periods presented 
the book value of the net assets to be sold of this segment have been reflected in net assets of business held for disposition in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  upon consummation of a successful sale  the company intends to use the proceeds for investment in inextv and other internet initiatives  as well as to retire debt 
following the planned sale of data systems  the company s continuing operations will include inextv  its non internet technology licensing group  the newly formed internet technology group and micronet  its wholly owned subsidiary that makes high performance disk arrays and san products principally datadock  genesis and sancube products 
these product groups are described below 
no other class of similar products  services or royalty arrangements accounted for more than of continuing revenues during the comparison periods discussed below 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations for the three years ended december  total revenue 
total revenue increased by to million in from million in  which increased by from the total revenue of million in in  the revenue increase over was primarily due to the increased royalty income 
in addition  there was an increase in total revenue in as a result of the inclusion of the company s internet video businesses and an increase in product sales from micronet reflecting the inclusion of an entire twelve month period in compared to the six month period since acquiring micronet in june in  the revenue increase compared to is attributed to the inclusion of micronet product sales for the six month period  offset in part by slightly lower royalty income 
royalty income 
royalty income was million in  million in and million in the increase in royalties in was positively impacted by royalty income of approximately million  representing the portion of royalties earned through from a previously disclosed long term license agreement extending through the year the company s royalty income derives from patent licenses  and the company receives most of its royalty income from licenses with companies that manufacture consumer video products such as vcrs and camcorders and  in certain cases  professional video tape recorders 
during this period  a growing portion of royalty income related to mm and mm video recorders and camcorders 
the company is assessing whether manufacturers of video games  dvd recorders and digital television receivers are using its patented technology 
there can be no assurance that the manufacturers of these products are utilizing the company s technology or  if used  whether the company will be able to negotiate license agreements with the manufacturers 
royalty income has historically fluctuated widely due to a number of factors that the company cannot predict or control such as the extent of use of the company s patented technology by third parties  the materiality of any nonrecurring royalties received as the result of negotiated settlements for products sold by manufacturers prior to entering into licensing agreements with the company  the extent which the company must pursue litigation in order to enforce its patents  and the ultimate success of its licensing and litigation activities 
the costs of patent litigation can be material  and the institution of patent enforcement litigation may also increase the risk of counterclaims alleging infringement by the company of patents held by third parties or seeking to invalidate patents held by the company 
see legal proceedings  above 
internet revenue 
the company s internet video programming and services business began in early  and in june were consolidated under its subsidiary  inextv 
inextv recorded revenue of million in the year ended december   principally from internet video services conducted by tv onthe web 
such revenues do not include revenues of tv  which provides internet video services to european businesses  as tv is not a majority owned affiliate 
inextv currently anticipates that internet video revenues will grow in  but that revenues from advertising and e commerce are not expected to become significant until the second half of the company s two new websites  exbtv 
com and istyletv 
com  which are expected to rely significantly on advertising and e commerce revenues  were launched in the first quarter of additionally  aentv 
com s new programming  on which it will be primarily dependent for revenue  was introduced in the fourth quarter of product sales 
the company has included the operations of micronet in its consolidated results of operations since its acquisition effective june  sales of micronet products for totaled million compared to the six month period since acquisition of million 
the company believes that micronet sales levels have been adversely impacted by the decision to withdraw from lower priced product lines  and micronet is refocusing on higher performance disk array products such as the datadock  and genesis which was introduced in in  micronet has introduced sancube which is anticipated to further enhance micronet s position in the market for storage area network products 
intellectual property costs 
intellectual property costs relate to those expenditures incurred by the company s in house patent department in procuring royalty income and expenditures associated with patent enforcement litigation 
intellectual property costs totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
expenditures in were higher than in subsequent years as the company filed a lawsuit alleging patent infringement resulting in additional legal expenses 
internet video programming and site development 
internet video programming and site development costs of million in represent costs incurred for services rendered to customers  as well as costs incurred for the development of made for the internet video programming and website hardware and software purchases in preparation for the launch of exbtv 
com and istyletv 
com 
such costs also include costs incurred by ampex s internet technology group to develop improved internet video technology that will be used by inextv and its affiliates 
the company anticipates that site development startup costs will decline in the first quarter of  but that expenditures for program production  marketing and advertising will increase materially as the network expands 
cost of product sales 
product costs associated with micronet sales were million and million in and the six month period since acquisition  respectively 
the company has been transitioning micronet s product line to focus on higher margin disk arrays and storage area network products 
gross margins on such products are generally higher than on the company s current product lines 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses associated with micronet increased to million of product sales in from million of product sales in the majority of rd e was focused on the development and engineering on disk array products  specifically the development of the genesis and sancube product lines which have been introduced to the market in and early  respectively 
the company did not have any rd e expenses in the company is also committed to investing in research  development and engineering programs which support inextv s internet video strategy 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in in addition to costs incurred for the internet video programming and site development discussed above  the company s internet video businesses incurred sales  marketing and administrative expenses totaling million in in  there were no material internet related expenditures 
micronet incurred expenditures of million in compared to million for the six month period since acquisition 
the company anticipates that it will need to increase its sales and marketing efforts to be successful in bringing together the necessary capabilities to build the company s presence in internet video markets and increase sales at micronet due to its new product offerings in early amortization of goodwill and asset writedown 
in connection with the acquisitions of each of micronet  tv onthe web and aentv  the purchase price exceeded the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  resulting in the recording of goodwill 
goodwill is being amortized on a straight line basis over a three to five year period from the respective dates of acquisition 
additional goodwill may be recognized to the extent that future payments are required to be paid on the micronet preferred stock  or if the company exercises options to acquire controlling equity interest in its other internet video affiliates 
the rapid amortization policy results in material charges against operations and increased losses being recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  the company elected not to exercise options to acquire additional ownership in executive branch webcasting corporation ebwc but to proceed with the development of exbtv 
com as an inextv funded internet video initiative 
the company wrote off its minority investment in ebwc totaling million 
also in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off a minority investment in a company providing web hosting and internet consulting services  totaling million  since the company is no longer involved in the strategic direction of that entity 
acquisition of in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of micronet  the independent appraisal of the in process research and development resulted in the recording of a one time million charge in the second quarter of at the acquisition date  micronet was in the process of developing four significant enhancements to its data dock product line which had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no future alternative use 
these projects included 
the first generation genesis product  a disk array with a scalable  variable raid configured disk array offering up to terabyte of capacity and fibre channel interface for broadband users  
the second generation genesis product that will incorporate a fibre channel back plane to permit fibre channel connectivity to fibre channel disk drives  
datadock products offering a low voltage differential compatible back plane to connect to ultra scsi channels between the disk array and host computer  
datadock products offering ethernet connectivity permitting local and remote monitoring via tcp ip networks and standard web browsers for multiple user workgroup environments 
the classification of each research and development project as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of sfas  sfas and fin the above development projects were estimated to be completed within months of the acquisition date and between and complete  based on engineering estimates of hours incurred to date and hours expected to be required to complete technological feasibility per project 
the company s development effort involves storage subsystem design and includes software  firmware and electronics designed to tie together disk drives and third party hardware drive mechanisms 
micronet s design philosophy is to incorporate off the shelf technology as it becomes available and proven in the marketplace  and to focus its design activities on ease of use  reliability  security  durability and similar enhancements 
as a result  its development activities can be budgeted with a fair degree of precision 
all in process r d projects continue to progress  in all material respects  consistently with the assumptions that micronet provided to the independent appraiser for use in the valuation of the in process r d 
the company used an independent appraisal firm to assist it with its valuation of the fair market value of the purchased assets of micronet and the valuation of the consideration issued 
fair market value is defined as the estimated amount at which an asset might be expected to be exchanged between a willing buyer and willing seller  assuming the buyer continues to use the assets in their current operations 
micronet provided assumptions by product line of revenue  cost of goods sold and operating expense to the appraiser to assist in the valuation 
the appraisal considered three traditional approaches to valuation the cost approach  the market approach and the income approach 
the incomplete technology represents a mix of near and mid term prospects for the business and imparts a level of uncertainty to its prospects 
it is the nature of the business to be constantly developing enhanced products that offer improved storage capacity and performance 
a reasonable expectation of return on the incomplete technology would be higher than that of completed technology due to these inherent risks 
as a result  the earnings associated with incomplete technology were discounted at a rate of  and included as in process r d only that portion of the discounted revenues that had been completed at the acquisition date 
the valuation was based on the assumption that the estimated cost to complete all products under development  measured as of the acquisition date  would be approximately  the valuation approach also assumed that these products would generate revenues through the year the inability of micronet to complete this technology within the expected timeframes could materially impact future revenues and earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on micronet s business  financial condition and results of operations 
operating income loss 
the company incurred an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in and operating income of million in the operating loss in was primarily due to the inclusion of the company s internet video activities  including amortization of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of tv onthe web and aentv and the write off of two minority investments described above  offset in part by royalty income of which approximately million relates to royalties earned from a previously disclosed license agreement 
the company expects to make additional strategic acquisitions relative to its internet video strategy that will require significant expenditures in and future periods 
the company may also incur material charges to goodwill amortization and that will increase consolidated net losses while the company is building its internet programming network 
interest expense 
interest expense  primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes due and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock in january and july  increased between the comparison periods 
interest expense was not material in amortization of debt financing costs 
these amounts reflect periodic amortization of financing costs over the remaining terms of the debt 
financing costs associated with the january and july issuance of the senior notes are being charged to expense over five years 
interest income 
interest income is earned on cash balances and short and long term investments 
in and the company  pending application of the proceeds of the senior notes  had significantly higher investment balances compared to  which resulted in higher interest income 
in  interest income included imputed interest on the notes received in connection with the sale of the company s redwood city  california property in the notes were fully paid in other income expense  net 
in  other income expense  net includes a proportionate share of the net loss for the period the company held a minority interest in tv onthe web and aentv 
provision for benefit of income taxes 
the provisions for income taxes in and consist primarily of foreign income taxes and withholding taxes on royalty income 
in the first quarter of  the company reversed million previously reserved in connection with disputed state income taxes for the prior years  following the favorable settlement of that dispute in march in the second and third quarters of  the company reversed and million  respectively  previously reserved in connection with the liquidation of its subsidiary in italy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company was not required to include any material provision for us federal income tax in any of the last three fiscal years due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards and timing differences 
at december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards for income tax purposes of million  expiring in the years through as a result of financing transactions that were completed in and  the company is limited in the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that can offset consolidated federal taxable income in a given year 
the company derives pretax foreign income from its international operations  which are conducted principally by its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  the company s royalty income is subject  in certain cases  to foreign tax withholding 
such income is taxed by foreign taxing authorities and the company s domestic interest and amortization expenses and operating loss carry forwards are not deductible in computing such foreign taxes 
gain loss of business held for disposition 
in february  the board of directors of the company authorized management to pursue a sale of data systems  its wholly owned subsidiary that manufacturers and sells high performance  tape based mass data storage products 
as a result  for all periods presented  the company reported as a single line item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  a gain loss of business held for disposition  net of taxes of million  million and million in  and  respectively

at december   the company had cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
data systems  which is accounted for as a discontinued operation  had working capital of million and million at december  and  respectively 
working capital of data systems has been classified in net assets of business held for disposition at december   whereas such balances are included in the respective balance sheet accounts of the company at december  the decline in cash and short term investments from to results primarily from operating losses of the company s internet video businesses  operations of the internet technology group and operating losses of micronet 
these losses more than offset operating income from the company s non internet technology licensing activities

other non cash charges affecting operations included other depreciation and amortization of million  the company s equity in losses in internet businesses prior to the company having acquired control in such affiliates totaling million  and stock issued to individuals for services rendered to the company totaling million 
during  the company  through its subsidiary inextv  acquired majority control of tv onthe web and aentv in step acquisitions 
the company invested a total of million in such affiliates 
the company has included the value of assets and liabilities of these majority owned affiliates in its consolidated financial statements and has reported of net losses reported by these affiliates for periods after it acquired a majority interest 
also during  the company acquired minority interests in executive branch webcasting corporation ebwc and tv the company invested a total of million in such affiliates 
the company has elected not to exercise options to acquire additional ownership in ebwc but to proceed with the development of exbtv 
com as an inextv funded internet video initiative 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off its minority investment in ebwc 
the company s strategy is to grow internet revenues from video advertising  e commerce partnerships  webcasting and technology licensing 
in order to do so  the company will be required to incur substantial expenditures to attract users to its video websites  which have only recently become operational 
material advertising and e commerce revenues are not likely to be obtained until a significant base of users can be demonstrated 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining sufficient revenues from the above sources to make its internet video businesses viable or profitable 
the company intends to seek strategic partnerships with other companies in order to obtain additional content  brand recognition  user awareness  technology and infrastructure cost savings 
the company may be required to commit significant resources and or to issue a significant percent of its common stock in order to attract such prospective partners  which would dilute current stockholders interest in the company 
the company believes that it has adequate financial resources to develop its internet video businesses as presently envisioned for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may seek to raise additional capital this next fiscal year to support future years operations and to make new investments in streaming media internet ventures and technology 
the company may seek to issue additional shares of common stock in public or private equity transactions or seek to sell equity securities of one or several of its internet video businesses in an initial public offering 
there can be no assurance that a market will exist for the company s or its affiliates securities 
the company expects that it will face an increased number of competitors in future years  many of whom will be better capitalized and have greater financial resources than the company 
the ability to access the capital markets will be instrumental to the company s future success 
the company has available  through a subsidiary  a working capital facility that allows it to borrow or obtain letters of credit totaling million  based on eligible accounts receivable  through may at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million and had letters of credit issued against the facility totaling million

the company believes that this facility will be significantly reduced or allowed to expire in conjunction with the sale of data systems 
financing transactions 
during  holders of  shares of convertible preferred stock exchanged their holdings for  shares of common stock  leaving  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
subsequent to year end  holders of shares of convertible preferred stock exchanged their holdings for  shares of common stock 
beginning in june  the company will be required to redeem any remaining shares of convertible preferred stock in quarterly installments through september the company s redeemable preferred stock is redeemable in quarterly installments from june through march during  the company satisfied its redemption obligation by issuing  shares of common stock in exchange for redeemable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of million 
in april  the company agreed to exchange shares of redeemable preferred stock for  shares of common stock 
the resultant  benefit on exchange has been recognized as a benefit available to common stockholders on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  the company will have the option to redeem the redeemable preferred stock at any time and the convertible preferred stock beginning in june  and has the option to make mandatory redemption payments either in cash or in shares of common stock

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the company issued million of its senior notes  together with warrants to purchase million shares of its class a common stock the class a stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share at any time on or prior to march  at the end of the second quarter of  the company issued an additional million of senior notes 
as a result of the issuance of the senior notes  the company s total indebtedness and future debt service obligations have increased significantly from prior levels 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering have been invested to repay short term debt and trade accounts payable of micronet  and the balance has been invested in short term government securities and other investments 
the yield on the company s investment portfolio is substantially lower than the interest charges on the senior notes 
the company has wide discretion as to how the debt proceeds may be invested  including for acquisitions of and investments in new businesses  including the company s internet video businesses 
any such investments or acquisitions are not expected to pay a current return  which could require the company to fund debt service obligations on the senior notes out of its liquidity and cash flow from existing operations 
in order to minimize the difference between the interest the company currently receives on its investments and the interest payable on the senior notes  the company has invested a portion of the senior note proceeds in securities with higher yields  longer terms or lower credit quality  and the company may also engage in various transactions in derivative securities 
investments in any securities could expose the company to a risk of trading losses due to market or interest rate fluctuations or other factors that are not within the company s control 
the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains customary affirmative and negative restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the incurrence of additional senior debt  the payment of dividends  the sale of assets and other actions by the company and certain restricted subsidiaries 
upon a successful sale of data systems  the company plans to offer to repay a substantial portion of the senior notes 
recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for the company in fiscal year and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements  but the company believes there will not be a significant impact 
in december  the securities exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the sec 
the company believes that adopting sab will not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material 
investment risk 
the company invests in equity instruments of technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 
the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
investments  which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market
