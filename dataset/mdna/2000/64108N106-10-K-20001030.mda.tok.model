item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
the historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition and results of operations would have been had we been operated as an independent entity during the periods presented 
overview we began our operations in november  launched our first netphone product in july  and were established as a separate subsidiary of idt in october we have incurred net operating losses since inception and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing efforts 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we recognized significant charges relating to non cash executive compensation expense in fiscal and will recognize additional significant charges on an ongoing basis  in connection with the grants of options i with exercise prices less than market value on the date of grant and ii in connection with the adjustment to stock options in connection with the at t transactions 
with respect to these options  we recognized a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and million in fiscal  and will recognize charges of approximately million during fiscal  approximately million during fiscal  approximately million during fiscal and approximately  in fiscal in may  we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock which were converted into  shares of class a stock at per share at the time of our initial public offering 
the series a convertible preferred stock contains beneficial conversion features 
the total value of the beneficial conversion features is approximately million 
for accounting purposes  the value of the beneficial conversion features was limited to the amount of proceeds allocated to the series a convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a reduction in net income available to common stockholders in the quarter ended july  of approximately million 
in connection with the issuance of the series a convertible preferred stock  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of warrants on the date of issuance was million 
these warrants were exercised to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at the time of our initial public offering 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and a decrease to the carrying value of the series a convertible preferred stock 
the decrease in the carrying value of the series a convertible preferred stock will be accreted  with a corresponding reduction of additional paid in capital  over the period to the initial redemption date in may at the closing of our initial public offering in august  the balance of the unamortized amount was written off 
in connection with our distribution and marketing agreement with icq  we issued a warrant to america online to purchase up to percent of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis 
this warrant will vest in percent increments upon the achievement of each of three incremental thresholds of revenue generated under the agreement during the first four years that the warrant is outstanding 
the per share exercise price under the warrant will be equal to the lesser of per share or million divided by the number of our fully diluted shares on the initial exercise date 
if one or more of the revenue thresholds set forth in the warrant are achieved  we will recognize additional non cash charges in an amount equal to the value of the warrant  as determined at the time that these thresholds are met 
we offered  shares of our common stock in an initial public offering  which became effective on july  on august  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the  shares at the initial public offering price of per share 
on december   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
 shares were sold by selling stockholders and  shares were sold by netphone 
net proceeds to netphone  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were approximately million 
sources of revenue during fiscal  our revenues were derived from per minute charges we billed to our customers on a pre paid basis and from the sale of internet telephony equipment  such as yap gear  and services to resellers  idt and other carriers 
revenue increased approximately percent from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in billed minutes of use resulting from additional marketing of our products and services and the introduction of our yap product line of internet telephony devices 
specifically  revenue from services increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million in revenue for fiscal revenue from products increased approximately  percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal we anticipate that revenue from services will increase in absolute terms as our products become more widely distributed 
however  as a percentage of revenue  we expect revenue from these services to decline over the next several years as we begin to market additional products and services and pursue additional sources of revenue 
for example  we are selling web based advertising and sponsorship positions on our pc client  as well as msn s instant messenger to leverage our customer reach 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from per minute charges we charge our customers on a prepaid basis to use our services 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our revenue was derived from customers based outside of the united states 
as of july   we served over  active customers 
we recognize revenue as our customers utilize the balances in their prepaid accounts by placing calls 
as such  we have deferred revenue for all unutilized balances in our customers accounts 
cost structure our costs and expenses include direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  selling and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
direct cost of revenue direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  and routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination 
these costs exclude depreciation and include amounts paid to other carriers to terminate traffic on a per minute basis  the cost of leased routers and access servers  telecommunications costs  including the cost of local telephone lines to carry subscriber calls to our network  the costs associated with leased lines connecting our network directly to the internet or to our operations centers and connecting our operations centers to the internet  internet backbone costs  which are the amounts we pay to internet service providers for capacity  and costs associated with the manufacturing and licensing of equipment 
we expect our direct cost of revenue to increase in absolute terms over time to support our growing customer base 
while some of these costs are fixed  other costs vary on a per minute basis 
therefore  there may be some fluctuation in our direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  particularly as we aggressively expand our network 
we try to terminate calls on our own network whenever possible 
when we cannot terminate calls on our network  we terminate calls on the network of other suppliers  primarily idt 
we expect to continue to utilize this process 
we also expect the percentage of our traffic that we terminate with idt will decline in the future as we expand our own network and as we leverage our relationship with at t 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing includes the expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales personnel  advertising costs  referral fees and amounts paid to our strategic partners in connection with revenue sharing arrangements 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase over time as we aggressively market our products and services 
historically  selling and marketing expenses have been a relatively variable cost and are expected to increase in the near future both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as our revenue grows 
we expect to spend significant capital to build brand recognition 
most of our sales and marketing expenses will go toward securing significant and strategic relationships with a variety of internet companies 
over time  we expect these sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  and the cost of insurance  travel  entertainment  rent and utilities 
a large portion of our general and administrative expenses include operations and customer support 
these include the expenses associated with customer service and technical support  and consist primarily of the salaries and employment costs of the employees responsible for those efforts 
we expect operations and customer support expenses to increase over time to support new and existing customers 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase to support our growth  particularly as we establish a larger organization to implement our business plan 
we include our research and development costs  comprised primarily of payroll expenses for our technical team of engineers and developers  in general and administrative expenses 
we plan to incur additional costs for research and development  though they are not expected to increase as a percentage of revenue 
over time  we expect these relatively fixed general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization primarily relates to our hardware infrastructure 
we depreciate our network equipment over its estimated useful life ranging from five to fifteen years using the straight line method 
we plan to acquire a domestic high capacity network to provide additional capacity to handle the expected increase in customer traffic as our business grows 
in addition  we will be adding more network hardware as traffic volumes justify 
we expect depreciation to increase in absolute terms as we expand our network to support new and acquired customers  but to decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
amortization includes amortization of intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of aplio which was completed in july results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  percent statement of operations data revenue service revenue product revenue total revenue costs and expenses service cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization product cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization total direct costs of revenue selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization compensation charge from the issuance of stock options total costs and expenses loss from operations interest expense interest income other income net loss redeemable preferred stock dividends net loss available to common stockholders comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
our revenues are derived from per minute charges we billed to our customers on a pre paid basis and from the sale of internet telephony equipment  such as yap gear and services to resellers  idt and other carriers 
revenue increased approximately percent from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in billed minutes of use resulting from additional marketing of our products and services and the introduction of our yap product line of internet telephony devices 
specifically  revenue from services increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million in revenue for fiscal revenue from products increased approximately  percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal primarily due to the introduction of our line of yap gear in the third and fourth quarters of we anticipate that services revenue will increase in absolute terms as our services become more widely distributed 
however  as a percentage of revenue  we expect revenue from these services to decline over the next several years as we begin to market additional products and services and pursue additional sources of revenue 
direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization 
our direct cost of revenue consists primarily of network costs associated with carrying our customers traffic on our network and leased networks  routing their calls through a local telephone company to reach their final destination and wholesale cost of internet telephony devices 
total direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by percent from million for fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to monthly recurring costs from leased lines and other connectivity in anticipation of increased traffic volumes from our various distribution relationships 
as a percentage of revenue  we expect direct cost of revenue to increase as a result of a decline in per minute charges to customers 
we also expect to incur additional costs in connection with the growth of our business  especially in connection with increasing our own network capacity to handle increased traffic volumes which are expected to result from our recent relationships with at t  yahoo  aol  and msn 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with acquiring customers  including commissions paid to our sales personnel  advertising costs  referral fees and amounts paid to our strategic partners  some of which contain revenue sharing arrangements 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal however  we incurred a one time charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal which was associated with our termination of certain marketing agreements with smaller web properties  which had been important in our initial stage of development as a way of promoting brand awareness and consumer acceptance of our retail services  but have since been rendered superfluous to our marketing plan 
as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this increase primarily reflects the increased marketing and advertising expenses associated with the agreements established with priceline 
com  compuserve  infospace 
com  yahoo  excite  snap and other strategic partners  as well as the million one time charge 
we expect to continue to increase significantly our advertising and marketing expenditures to build additional brand recognition  and to enhance the distribution of our products and services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of the salaries of our employees and associated benefits  and the cost of insurance  travel  entertainment  rent and utilities 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the additional organizational infrastructure and increase in personnel as we continue to build our operations  customer service  marketing and business development functions  the building of our broadband and enterprise groups  and adding new office space 
moreover  in absolute terms  our research and development expenses will increase as we hire the additional engineers necessary to continue the development of new products and services 
however  these research and development expenses are not expected to significantly increase as a percentage of our total revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal depreciation and amortization will continue to increase as we increase capital expenditures for the deployment of network equipment both domestically and internationally to manage increased call volumes  as well as the amortization of intangible assets  associated with the acquisition of aplio 
compensation charge from the issuance of stock options 
we recognized million of non cash compensation expense in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  the compensation charge from issuance of stock options was percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal loss from operations 
loss from operations was approximately million for fiscal as compared to loss from operations of approximately million for fiscal excluding the non cash compensation charge and the one time costs described above  our loss from operations for fiscal and fiscal would have been million and million  respectively 
this change is due to the substantial increase in both selling and marketing expenses as well as general and administrative expenses we incurred as we expanded our distribution relationships  corporate infrastructure and human resources 
we anticipate continued and increasing losses as we pursue our growth strategy 
comparison of fiscal years ended july  and revenue 
revenue increased approximately percent from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million for fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in minutes of use resulting from additional marketing of our products and services 
specifically  revenue from services increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million in revenue for fiscal additionally  revenue from product decreased approximately percent from million for fiscal to approximately million in revenue for fiscal direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization 
total direct cost of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by percent from million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to improved efficiencies in terminating traffic and utilization of network assets 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs increased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this increase primarily reflects the increased marketing and advertising expenses associated with the agreements established with netscape  icq  infospace 
com  yahoo  excite and other strategic partners 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately percent from approximately million for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs decreased from approximately percent for fiscal to approximately percent for fiscal this decrease primarily reflects the efficiencies we have begun to realize from leveraging our sales and support infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased approximately percent from approximately  for fiscal to approximately million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  these costs remained relatively constant in fiscal and fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in capital expenditures for the deployment of network equipment both domestically and internationally to manage increased call volumes 
compensation charge from the issuance of stock options 
we recognized million of non cash compensation expense in fiscal as a result of option grants made in may and july as a percentage of total revenue  the compensation charge from issuance of stock options was percent in fiscal no compensation charge from the issuance of stock options was recognized in fiscal loss from operations 
loss from operations was approximately million for fiscal as compared to loss from operations of approximately million for fiscal excluding the non cash compensation charge described above  our loss from operations for fiscal would have been million 
this change is due to the substantial increase in both selling and marketing expenses as well as general and administrative expenses we incurred as we expanded our distribution relationships  corporate infrastructure and human resources 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the eight quarters ended july  this quarterly information is unaudited  has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements  and  in our opinion  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring accruals necessary for a fair presentation of the information for periods presented

includes amortization of goodwill from the aplio acquisition in the amount of  we have experienced growth in total revenue in each quarter since inception  reflecting greater acceptance and usage of our products and services by our expanded customer base 
we expect our revenue to grow over time as use of our services increase and our products such as yap become more popular 
however  we may experience declines in average revenue per minute due to competitive pressures  promotions and marketing initiatives  increased commissions paid to our international resellers and increased amounts paid to our strategic partners under existing and future revenue sharing arrangements 
our services revenue has increased in each quarter since inception and  over the last six quarters  has slightly decreased as a percentage of our total revenue 
this growth is primarily a result of expanded network coverage to create an increased number of access points for our customers  enhanced service offerings  lower prices and increased selling and marketing efforts to promote our services 
our product revenue has also increased in each quarter since january  growth of our product and service revenue in future periods depends  in part  upon the recently released distribution of our pc to phone service through the integration of our pc to phone software in icq s  yahoo s  and msn s instant messaging software and netscape s internet browser 
further  any delay by our strategic partners in releasing the next version of their respective products could delay the associated services revenue we could expect to receive from these sources 
in addition  other factors could delay our growth of services revenue 
these factors may include regulatory or other actions by foreign regulatory agencies or government controlled telecommunications companies 
in the quarter ended july   direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue accounted for approximately percent as compared to approximately percent in the quarter ended july  this increase is primarily attributable to monthly recurring costs from leased lines and other connectivity in anticipation of increased traffic volumes from our various distribution relationships with major partners such as aol  yahoo  and msn 
our increased sales and marketing expenses reflect the relationships we have with various online strategic partners with whom we advertise our pc to phone and phone to phone services  as well as the formation of our broadband enterprise groups  and our acquisition of aplio 
we expect to continue to increase significantly our advertising and marketing expenditures to build additional recognition of our products and services 
as a result of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete  we are unable to accurately forecast our revenue and direct cost of revenue as they may be impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors include the level of use of the internet as a communications medium  seasonal trends  capacity constraints  the amount and timing of our capital expenditures  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  price competition  technical difficulties or system downtime  and the development of regulatory restrictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
in fiscal year  we invested approximately million in five companies plus yahoo and webex primarily to enhance strategic relationships and to provide access to emerging technologies in order to strengthen our products and services 
we generated negative cash flow from operating activities of approximately million during the fiscal  compared with negative cash flow from operating activities of million during fiscal the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily caused by an increase in the net loss before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation expense and an increase in prepaid and other assets 
the company s capital expenditures increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  as we expanded our domestic and international network infrastructure 
historically  we financed our operations through advances from idt since our inception in january in may  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of our series a convertible preferred stock and warrants 
we applied a portion of the net proceeds from this sale to repay million of the million of advances from idt that were outstanding as of april  the remaining million due to idt was converted into a promissory note in may the entire principal balance was repaid during fiscal we offered  shares of our common stock in an initial public offering  which became effective on july  on august  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the  shares at the initial public offering price of per share 
on december   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
selling stockholders sold  shares and we sold  shares of common stock 
our proceeds from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
on august   a subsidiary of at t corp 
completed its billion investment in us 
the at t subsidiary purchased  newly issued shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  a portion of the options outstanding under our stock option plan held by our officers and employees contain change of control provisions that gave rise to accelerated vesting as a result of the transactions with at t and idt 
the accelerated vesting of stock options due to the transactions resulted in a one time non cash charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
in addition  we previously granted to idt employees options to purchase our common stock pursuant to our stock option plan 
since the transactions with at t and idt would have caused the options held by idt employees to terminate  our board agreed to take all necessary action to ensure that the rights of the employees of idt under the plan were not terminated or affected in any way as a result of the transactions 
the extension of such stock options resulted in a non cash charge against earnings  prior to the closing of the transactions of approximately million  and additional significant charges over the remaining vesting period of such options 
we believe that  based upon our present business plan  our existing cash resources  which include million received in connection with the at t transaction in first quarter of fiscal  will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months 
effects of inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation over the last several years  inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business and prospects 
risks related to our financial condition and our business our limited operating history makes evaluating our business difficult 
idt formed us as a subsidiary in october prior to that  we conducted business as a division of idt 
therefore  we have only a limited operating history with which you may evaluate our business 
you must consider the numerous risks and uncertainties an early stage company like ours faces in the new and rapidly evolving market for internet related services 
these risks include our ability to increase awareness of our brand and continue to build user loyalty  maintain our current  and develop new  strategic relationships  respond effectively to competitive pressures  and continue to develop and upgrade our network and technology 
if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks  sales of our products and services  as well as our ability to maintain or increase our customer base  will be substantially diminished 
we have never been profitable and expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have never been profitable on an annual basis 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of july  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
our operating and marketing expenses have continuously increased since inception and we expect them to continue to increase significantly during the next several years 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability 
we may not be able to do so 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in addition  we recognized significant charges relating to non cash executive compensation expense in fiscal and will recognize additional significant charges on an ongoing basis  in connection with the grants of options to purchase shares of our common stock 
with respect to these options  we recognized a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and million during fiscal  and will recognize charges of approximately million during fiscal  approximately million during fiscal  million during fiscal  and  in fiscal we intend to pursue new streams of revenue  which we have not attempted to generate before and which may not be profitable 
in addition to our minutes based revenue  we are beginning to generate new web based revenue opportunities from banner with our netphone free domestic pc to phone  yahoo instant messenger and msn instant messenger offerings and audio advertising  as well as from sponsorship opportunities on our pc to phone software user 
furthermore  with adir technologies  we will be commercializing our existing network management software 
adir will market its products to service providers  telecommunications companies  and equipment manufacturers 
we also intend to explore the availability of revenue sharing opportunities with online retailers 
we intend to devote significant capital and resources to create these new revenue streams and we cannot ensure that these investments will be profitable 
we may have difficulties managing our expanding operations  which may reduce our chances of achieving profitability 
our future performance will depend  in part  on our ability to manage our growth effectively 
to that end  we will have to undertake the following tasks  among others develop our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  improve coordination among our engineering  accounting  finance  marketing and operations personnel  enhance our management information systems capabilities  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
if we cannot accomplish these tasks  our chances of achieving profitability may be diminished 
if we fail to establish and maintain strategic relationships our ability to meet analyst expectations and our sales would suffer 
we currently have strategic relationships with at t  msn  aol  icq  yahoo  cisco and others 
we depend on these relationships to expand our customer base  distribute our products to potential customers  increase usage of our services  build brand awareness  and cooperatively market our products and services 
we believe that our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with leading internet companies and computer hardware and software companies  as well as key marketing distribution partners 
in cases where our products and services are integrated into our strategic partners product and service offerings  our ability to meet analyst expectations and our sales depend upon a timely release of these offerings 
if any of our strategic relationships are discontinued or if the release of these partners offerings that integrate our products and services are delayed  sales of our products and services and our ability to maintain or increase our customer base may be substantially diminished 
competition could reduce our market share and decrease our revenue 
the market for our services has been extremely competitive 
many companies offer products and services like ours  and many of these companies have a substantial presence in this market 
in addition  many of these companies are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
we therefore may not be able to compete successfully in this market 
if we do not succeed in competing with these companies  we will lose customers and our revenue will be substantially reduced 
our competitors include the following internet telephony service providers 
internet telephony service providers such as at t jens a japanese affiliate of at t  deltathree 
com a subsidiary of rsl communications  i link  ibasis formerly known as vip calling  icg communications  ipvoice 
com  itxc and ozemail which was acquired by mci worldcom route voice traffic over the internet 
software hardware providers 
companies such as vocaltec  netspeak and e net produce software and other computer equipment that may be installed on a user s computer to permit voice communications over the internet 
telecommunications companies 
a number of telecommunications companies  including at t  deutsche telekom  mci worldcom and qwest  currently maintain  or plan to maintain  packet switched networks to route the voice traffic of other telecommunications companies 
network hardware manufacturers 
a number of large telecommunications providers and equipment manufacturers  including alcatel  cisco  lucent  northern telecom and dialogic which was acquired by intel  have announced that they intend to offer products similar to ours 
we expect these products to allow live voice communications over the internet between parties using a personal computer and a telephone and between two parties using telephones 
cisco systems has also taken additional steps by recently acquiring companies that produce devices that help internet service providers carry voice over the internet while maintaining traditional phone usage and infrastructure 
voice enabled online commerce providers 
several companies  including usa global link and at t s inter active communications  have begun to apply internet telephony technologies in connection with online commerce transactions 
these providers compete with services of ours such as clicktalk by integrating voice communications into commercial web sites 
pricing pressures may lessen our competitive pricing advantage 
our success is based partly on our ability to provide discounted domestic and international long distance services by taking advantage of cost savings achieved by carrying voice traffic over the internet  as compared to carrying calls over long distance networks  such as those owned by at t  sprint and mci worldcom 
in recent years  the price of long distance calls has fallen 
in response  we have lowered the price of our service offerings 
for example  at t  sprint and mci worldcom have adopted pricing plans in which the rates that they charge for us domestic long distance calls are not always substantially higher than the rates that we charge for our us domestic service 
the price of long distance calls may decline to a point where we no longer have a price advantage over these traditional long distance services 
alternatively  other providers of long distance services may begin to offer unlimited or nearly unlimited use of some of their services for an attractive monthly rate 
we would then have to rely on factors other than price to differentiate our product and service offerings  which we may not be able to do 
we may not be able to compete with providers that can bundle long distance services with other offerings 
our competitors may be able to bundle services and products that we do not offer together with long distance or internet telephony services 
these services could include wireless communications  voice and data services  internet access and cable television 
this form of bundling would put us at a competitive disadvantage if these providers can combine a variety of service offerings at a single attractive price 
in addition  some of the telecommunications and other companies that compete with us may be able to provide customers with lower communications costs or other incentives with their services  reducing the overall cost of their communications packages  and significantly increasing pricing pressures on our services 
this form of competition could significantly reduce our revenues 
if our customers do not perceive our service to be effective or of high quality  our brand and name recognition would suffer 
we believe that establishing and maintaining a brand and name recognition is critical for attracting and expanding our targeted client base 
we also believe that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in our market increases 
promotion and enhancement of our name will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts and on our success in continuing to provide high quality products and services  neither of which can be assured 
we depend on our international operations  which subject us to unpredictable regulatory and political situations 
as of july   approximately percent of our customers were based outside of the united states  generating approximately percent of our revenue during fiscal a significant component of our strategy is to continue to expand internationally 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding into additional international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenue from foreign operations and expand our international presence  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis  including changing regulatory requirements  which vary widely from country to country  action by foreign governments or foreign telecommunications companies to limit access to our services  increased bad debt and subscription fraud  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  political instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not materially adversely affect the growth of our business or our customer base 
all of the telephone calls made by our customers are connected through local telephone companies and  at least in part  through leased networks that may become unavailable 
we are not a local telephone company or a registered local exchange carrier 
our network covers only portions of the united states 
accordingly  we must route parts of some domestic and all international calls made by our customers over leased transmission facilities 
in addition  because our network does not extend to homes or businesses  we must route calls through a local telephone company to reach our network and  ultimately  to reach their final destinations 
in many of the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct or plan to conduct business  the primary provider of significant intra national transmission facilities is the national telephone company 
accordingly  we may have to lease transmission capacity at artificially high rates from a monopolistic provider and  consequently  we may not be able to generate a profit on those calls 
in addition  national telephone companies may not be required by law to lease necessary transmission lines to us or  if applicable law requires national telephone companies to lease transmission facilities to us  we may encounter delays in negotiating leases and interconnection agreements and commencing operations 
additionally  disputes may result with respect to pricing terms and billing 
in the united states  the providers of local telephone service are generally the incumbent local telephone companies  including the regional bell operating companies 
the permitted pricing of local transmission facilities that we lease in the united states is subject to uncertainties 
the federal communications commission has issued an order requiring incumbent local telephone companies to price those facilities at total element long run incremental cost  and the united states supreme court upheld the fcc s jurisdiction to set a pricing standard for local transmission facilities provided to competitors 
however  the incumbent local telephone companies can be expected to bring additional legal challenges to the fcc s total element long run incremental cost standard and  if they succeed  the result may be to increase the cost of incumbent local transmission facilities obtained by us 
our success depends on our ability to handle a large number of simultaneous calls  which our systems may not be able to accommodate 
we expect the volume of simultaneous calls to increase significantly as we expand our operations 
our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
if we fail to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance  or if our service is disrupted  our reputation could be hurt and we could lose customers 
because we are unable to definitively predict the volume of usage and our capacity needs  we may be forced to enter into disadvantageous contracts that would reduce our operating margins 
in order to ensure that we are able to handle additional usage  we have agreed to pay idt a one time fee of approximately million for a year right to use part of a new high capacity network that is under construction 
we may have to enter into additional long term agreements for leased capacity 
to the extent that we overestimate our call volume  we may be obligated to pay for more transmission capacity than we actually use  resulting in costs without corresponding revenue 
conversely  if we underestimate our capacity needs  we may be required to obtain additional transmission capacity through more expensive means that may not be available 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to grow our business 
we intend to continue to grow our business 
due to our limited operating history and the nature of our industry  our future capital needs are difficult to predict 
therefore  we may require additional capital to fund any of the following unanticipated opportunities  strategic alliances  potential acquisitions  changing business conditions  and unanticipated competitive pressures 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive to us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  our growth could be impeded 
any damage to or failure of our systems or operations could result in reductions in  or terminations of  our services 
our success depends on our ability to provide efficient and uninterrupted  high quality services 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  telecommunication failures  physical or electronic break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events that may be or may not be beyond our control 
the occurrence of any or all of these events could hurt our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our brand 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
it may be difficult for us to enforce certain of our intellectual property rights against third parties who may have acquired intellectual property rights by filing unauthorized applications in foreign countries to register the marks that we use because of their familiarity with our worldwide operations 
since internet related industries such as ours are exposed to the intellectual property laws of numerous foreign countries and trademark rights are territorial  there is uncertainty in the enforceability and scope of protection of our intellectual property 
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties may damage our brand 
defending against intellectual property infringement claims could be expensive and could disrupt our business 
we cannot be certain that our products and services do not or will not infringe upon valid patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held or claimed by third parties 
multi tech  inc has filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we infringe upon its patents 
we are incurring substantial expenses defending this claim 
if multi tech is successful  we may be subject to significant monetary liability and our business may be materially disrupted 
we may also be subject to other legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against those third party infringement claims  regardless of their merit 
successful infringement claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business 
risks related to our relationship with at t a subsidiary of at t has acquired approximately percent of our outstanding capital stock and percent of our aggregate voting power 
this transaction contains certain risks associated with it including the following there is uncertainty regarding at t licenses 
there is no commitment from at t to use our technology  and therefore there is no assurance that at t will pay us any royalties  notwithstanding the fact that its significant interest in us should give it an incentive to do so 
our relationship may discourage others from seeking nonexclusive licenses 
our obligation to grant non exclusive most favored nation licenses to at t will preclude us from granting exclusive licenses to others and may discourage others from seeking nonexclusive licenses  particularly if at t fails to use our technology and at t s failure to use it is deemed to be a negative reflection on the technology 
it may be a disadvantage to have a subsidiary of at t as our largest shareholder 
as a financially strong company  at t may be less likely than others might be to agree to an acquisition of netphone as a whole by another company in a transaction in which our public stockholders could realize a premium for their shares 
we may experience conflicts of interest resulting from at t s designation of members of our board of directors 
at t has the right to designate three members of our board of directors 
this presence on our board of directors may give rise to significant influence and or conflicts of interest with respect to certain decisions involving business opportunities and similar matters that may arise in the ordinary course of our business or the business of at t 
risks related to our relationship with idt we have contracted with idt for various services and for the use of its telecommunications network  which contracts we may not be able to renew when they expire 
in may  we entered into agreements with idt under which idt will continue to provide administrative and telecommunication services to us 
these agreements have an initial term of one year  and at the end of the initial term and each year thereafter  will automatically renew for additional one year periods unless one party has given the other party prior termination notice 
when these agreements expire  we will need to extend them  engage other entities to perform these services or perform these services ourselves 
in addition  after the initial term  these agreements are terminable by either party upon prior written notice 
we cannot assure you that idt will not terminate these agreements or continue to provide these services after the initial term of the agreements 
as a result  we may have to purchase these services from third parties or devote resources to handle these functions internally  which may cost us more than we paid idt for the same services 
in addition  idt has provided us in the past with working capital to fund our operations  and idt is not under any obligation  under these agreements or otherwise  to do so in the future 
we may experience conflicts of interest with idt  which may not be resolved in our favor 
two members of our board of directors are officers and or directors of idt 
additionally  one of our directors  james r 
mellor  was a director of idt until june in addition  certain of our executive officers  directors and employees hold shares of idt common stock and options to acquire shares of idt common stock 
these individuals may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain decisions involving business opportunities and similar matters that may arise in the ordinary course of our business or the business of idt 
if conflicts arise with idt  we expect to resolve those conflicts on a case by case basis  and in the manner required by applicable law and customary business practices  subject to our agreement with idt to resolve disputes involving million or less through mandatory  binding arbitration 
conflicts  if any  could be resolved in a manner adverse to us and our stockholders  which could harm our business 
idt currently owns approximately percent of our outstanding capital stock and controls percent of our voting power 
therefore  idt will have input in the election of our directors  the appointment of new management and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of our stockholders  including any amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of our company or of all of our assets 
in addition  we could be prevented from entering into certain transactions that could be beneficial to us 
third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of idt s stockholdings and voting rights 
risks related to our industry if the internet does not continue to grow as a medium for voice communications  our business will suffer 
the technology that allows voice communications over the internet is still in its early stages of development 
historically  the sound quality of internet calls was poor 
as the industry has grown  sound quality has improved  but the technology requires additional refinement 
additionally  the internet s capacity constraints may impede the acceptance of internet telephony 
callers could experience delays  errors in transmissions or other interruptions in service 
making telephone calls over the internet must also be accepted as an alternative to traditional telephone service 
because the internet telephony market is new and evolving  predicting the size of this market and its growth rate is difficult 
if our market fails to develop  then we will be unable to grow our customer base and our opportunity for profitability will be harmed 
our business will not grow without increased use of the internet 
the use of the internet as a commercial marketplace is at an early stage of development 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services over the internet are still uncertain 
we cannot predict whether customers will be willing to shift their traditional activities online 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including concerns about security  internet congestion  inconsistent service  and lack of cost effective  high speed access 
if the use of the internet as a commercial marketplace does not continue to grow  we may not be able to grow our customer base  which may prevent us from achieving profitability 
governmental regulations regarding the internet may be passed  which could impede our business 
the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and is changing rapidly as use of the internet increases 
for example  in the united states  the federal communications commission is considering whether to impose surcharges or additional regulations upon certain providers of internet telephony 
in addition  regulatory treatment of internet telephony outside the united states varies from country to country 
for example  access to certain services may be negatively impacted by government regulation 
there can be no assurance that there will not be future interruptions in foreign countries or that we will be able to return to the level of service we had in any such countries prior to any interruptions 
these actions and other similar actions in foreign countries may adversely affect our continuing ability to offer services in these and other countries  causing us to lose customers and revenue 
new regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from delivering our products and services over the internet  which could adversely affect our customer base and our revenue 
the growth of the internet may also be significantly slowed 
this could delay growth in demand for our products and services and limit the growth of our revenue 
in addition to new regulations being adopted  existing laws may be applied to the internet 
new and existing laws may cover issues that include sales and other taxes  access charges  user privacy  pricing controls  characteristics and quality of products and services  consumer protection  contributions to the universal service fund  an fcc administered fund for the support of local telephone service in rural and high cost areas  cross border commerce  copyright  trademark and patent infringement  and other claims based on the nature and content of internet materials 
our risk management practices may not be sufficient to protect us from unauthorized transactions or thefts of services 
we may be the victim of fraud or theft of service 
from time to time  callers have obtained our services without rendering payment by unlawfully using our access numbers and personal identification numbers 
we attempt to manage these theft and fraud risks through our internal controls and our monitoring and blocking systems 
if these efforts are not successful  the theft of our services may cause our revenue to decline significantly 
one vote per share 
except as otherwise required by law or as described below  the holders of class a common stock and common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their vote or approval  including the election of directors 
the holders of class a common stock may have the ability to elect all of our directors and to effect or prevent certain corporate transactions 
these provisions could discourage takeover attempts and could materially adversely affect the price of our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the securities and exchange commission s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments such as investments and debt that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to significant market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes
