in these evaluations  management considers numerous factors including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  loan loss experience and management s estimate of potential losses 
these various analyses lead to a determination of the amount needed in the allowance for credit losses 
to the extent the existing allowance is below the amount so determined  a provision is made that will bring the allowance to such amount 
thus  the provision for credit losses may fluctuate and may not be comparable from year to year

loan portfolio total loans at december  increased to  million  a million  or increase over the previous year end 
the increase in total loans was primarily due to increases in commercial and real estate mortgage loans

loans outstanding in this category increased to million  an increase of million  or  over year end loans in this category are primarily loans to small and medium sized businesses and professionals doing business in hawaii 
as mentioned previously  the company increased us mainland based participations and purchased loans as well as usda guaranteed loans in the average loan balance was  at december  these loans have been made primarily on a collateralized basis 
typically  real estate serves as collateral as well as equipment  receivables and personal assets as deemed necessary 
real estate mortgage 
real estate mortgage loans increased to million at december   an increase of million  or  over year end the primary reason for this increase in the mortgage portfolio was the decreased loan sales activity which resulted in loans being originated for investment versus for sale

nonperforming loans declined to million at december  a decrease of million  or  from the million at year end during  the company sold million in delinquent loans including million of nonperforming loans 
this sale resulted in a loss of million see further discussion in noninterest income of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest income which would have been accrued in on nonaccrual loans had these loans been current amounted to million  as compared to the million of interest income recorded on these loans during at december   oreo net of valuation allowance amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from the prior year end 
despite the decrease in the oreo balance and provision for oreo losses  the balance remains at levels higher than pre years and reflects the continued weakness in the hawaii economy and related decline in real estate values 
additionally  the company has also been more aggressive in its delinquent loan collection efforts resulting in a higher level of foreclosures and related oreo 
past due loans which are still accruing interest decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease reflects the company s proactive collection efforts which resulted in the removal of a million credit from this category in primarily all loans in this category are both well collateralized and in the process of collection 
restructured loans increased million  or  as compared to due to the restructuring of certain commercial loans in at december   the company was not aware of any significant potential problem loans not otherwise classified as nonperforming or past due where possible credit problems of the borrower caused management to have serious concerns as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
deposits the company competes for deposits in hawaii principally by providing quality customer service at its branch offices 
the company has a network of branch offices which seek to provide a stable core deposit base 
a new branch in kihei  maui  is scheduled to open during the second quarter of the deposit base provided by these branches consists of interest and noninterest bearing demand and savings accounts  money market certificates and time certificates of deposit

advances from the fhlb were made under credit line agreements totaling million  of which million was undrawn at december  see notes j and k of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were four long term fhlb advances totaling million  callable beginning january  to july  liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order that the cash flow needs of the company are met in the most economical and expedient manner 
the liquidity needs of a financial institution require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and the credit commitments of borrowers 
in order to optimize liquidity  management monitors and forecasts the various sources and uses of funds in an effort to continually meet the financial requirements of the company and the financial needs of its customer base 
on a stand alone basis  the company s primary source of liquidity is dividends from the bank and association 
the bank and association s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions 
to ensure liquidity on a short term basis  the company s primary sources are cash or cash equivalents  loan repayments  proceeds from the sale of assets available for sale  increases in deposits  proceeds from maturing securities and  when necessary  federal funds purchased  brokered deposits and credit arrangements with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
maturities of investment securities are also structured to cover large commitments and seasonal fluctuations in credit arrangements 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify three major sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s operating activities provided million in  an increase of million from the million used in the primary source of cash flows from operations in was the sale of million of loans held for sale  which amounted to million at december  due to the company s growth strategies in as well as liquidity needs due to the year date change  the company s use of fhlb advances increased in the current year

as of december   the bank and the association had available unused credit lines of million from the fhlb 
during  million of short term and million of long term borrowings from the fhlb mature 
the borrowing agreements with the fhlb are currently being negotiated for renewal in may and the company anticipates that the fhlb maturities will be covered by such renewals 
the company is also currently applying for an increased credit line with the fhlb calculated as a percentage of total qualified assets to be applied to the company on a combined basis  subsequent to the merger 
in addition  the company anticipates that the available unused credit line will increase to million  versus million  based on combined qualified assets as of december  the company anticipates continued growth in the loan portfolio in the company intends to fund this anticipated increase in the use of funds by time certificates of deposit  brokered deposits and fhlb advances 
the company s most liquid assets are cash  interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investment activities during any given period 
at december   cash  interest bearing deposits  federal funds sold and available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities totaled million  an increase of from million at december  investing activities provided used cash flow of million in  million during  and million in the primary use of cash for investing activities in was the net increase in loans of million and purchases of available for sale securities of million

capital resources the company has a strong capital base with a tier i capital ratio of at december  this is well above the minimum regulatory guideline of for tier i capital 
bank holding companies are also required to comply with risk based capital guidelines as established by the federal reserve board 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets that include both on and off balance sheet exposures 
a company s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital the numerator of the ratio by its risk weighted assets the denominator 
the minimum required qualifying total capital ratio is 
as of december   the company s total capital to risk adjusted assets ratio was 
during the second quarter of  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  or approximately  shares  of its million shares of common stock outstanding 
as of december   shares had been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share  at a total cost of million 
year the year problem was a significant issue facing financial institutions 
because computers frequently use only two digits to recognize years instead of four digits  many computer systems  as well as equipment using embedded computer chips  could have been unable to distinguish the year this would have produced erroneous results or systems may have failed in the year when the two digit year became 
in  the company established a year committee comprised of senior managers from each major operational unit 
the year committee had prepared a comprehensive program to address this problem to ensure that the company s computer systems would function properly in the years and thereafter 
the company successfully completed its year program in a timely and effective manner 
the company did not experience any significant disruptions to the financial or operating activities caused by failure of the computerized systems resulting from year issues 
although there has been no impact to date  the company may be affected by the year effects of governmental agencies  businesses and other entities who provide data to  or receive data from  the company  and by entities  such as borrowers  vendors and customers  whose financial condition or operational capability is significant to the company 
the company is also subject to credit risk to the extent borrowers failed to adequately address their year issues 
while the company continued discussions with  obtained written certification from  tested such external parties year compliance efforts  and have not experienced to date any adverse impact as a result of the failure of these companies to resolve their year issues  there is no assurance that there will be no future adverse impact on the company as a result of unresolved year issues of third parties 
the company has expended  and will continue to expend  the resources necessary to address future issues in a timely manner 
through december   cumulative incremental expenditures of less than million have been incurred out of a total projected million 
the incremental expenditures exclude internal cost and the approximately million cost incurred in converting to the fiserv comprehensive banking system 
the company did not separately track internal costs related to the internal allocation of personnel and other costs related to the year project 
most of these incremental expenditures related to the acquisition and implementation of new and enhanced systems and or equipment  which was capitalized and amortized over their respective useful lives 
expenses related to the company s internal resources and year remediation costs were expensed as incurred 
minimal future expenditures are expected to take place over the next year  funded by operating cash flows  and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance  however  can be given that the year problem will not have an adverse impact on the company s future earnings 
effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate changes have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
quarterly results of operations unaudited operating earnings for the fourth quarter of were million  or per diluted share  a increase over operating earnings of million  or per diluted share for the same quarter in operating cash earnings for the fourth quarter of were million  or per diluted share  a increase over the same quarter in as previously mentioned  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a non cash after tax charge of million per share related to its change in method for evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  from an undiscounted cash flow to a discounted cash flow basis 
in addition  the company recorded an after tax charge of million per share related to the impending merger of its two principal subsidiaries  the bank and the association

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest bearing assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be adversely affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  theoretically  the net earnings of an institution with a positive gap position may increase as it is able to invest in higher yielding interest earning assets at a more rapid rate than its interest bearing liabilities reprice 
the company also measures and monitors its sensitivity to interest rates using net interest income simulations on a quarterly basis 
any identified exposure is managed primarily through the use of off balance sheet instruments such as swaps  caps  floors and options on mortgage backed securities and through extending or shortening the duration of the investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio  retail certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
the company currently does not engage in the use of trading activities  high risk derivatives and synthetic instruments in controlling its interest rate risk 
such uses are permitted at the recommendation of alco with the approval of the board of directors 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity or magnitude  and since volatility is subject to change  the gap is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity

in connection with these asset and liability management objectives  various actions have been taken  including changes in the composition of assets and liabilities  and the use of financial instruments 
when appropriate  alco may utilize off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a board of directors approved hedging policy statement governs the use of these instruments 
the financial instruments used and their notional amounts outstanding at december for the years indicated were as follows in thousands of dollars interest rate swaps pay fixed swaps notional amount  average receive rate average pay rate under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amount 
the company paid the fixed rate and received the floating rate under the majority of its swaps outstanding at december  interest rate contracts are primarily used to convert certain deposits and long term debt to floating interest rates or to convert certain groups of customer loans and other interest earning assets to fixed rates 
certain interest rate swaps specifically match the amounts and terms of particular liabilities 
interest rate options  which primarily consist of caps and floors  are interest rate protection instruments that involve the payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer 
this differential represents the difference between current interest rates and an agreed upon rate applied to a notional amount 
interest rate caps limit the cap holder s risk associated with an increase in interest rates 
interest rate floors limit the risk associated with a decline in interest rates 
interest rate options at december  and consisted of the following notional estimated notional estimated in thousands of dollars amount fair value amount fair value caps  floors   total interest rate options   interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet as well as for off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  estimated nii sensitivity rate change bp bp loan growth from december  to of million  or  has been predominantly longer term fixed rate or prime based loans while funding has been mainly a combination of short term time certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
these changes have made the balance sheet more liability sensitive and more negatively exposed to continued upward movement in interest rates 
as a result  the company has been and will continue efforts to extend terms of time certificates of deposits and use of putable fhlb advances to extend funding terms 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
