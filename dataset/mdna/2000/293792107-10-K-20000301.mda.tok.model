item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of enterprise products partners lp enterprise or the company included elsewhere herein 
general the company i processes natural gas  ii fractionates for a processing fee mixed ngls produced as by products of oil and natural gas production into their component products ethane  propane  isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline  iii converts normal butane to isobutane through the process of isomerization  iv produces mtbe from isobutane and methanol  and v transports ngl products to end users by pipeline and railcar 
the company also separates high purity propylene from refinery sourced propane propylene mix and transports high purity propylene to plastics manufacturers by pipeline 
products processed by the company generally are used as feedstocks in petrochemical manufacturing  in the production of motor gasoline and as fuel for residential and commercial heating 
the company s ngl processing operations are concentrated in the texas  louisiana  and mississippi gulf coast area 
a large portion is concentrated in mont belvieu  texas  which is the hub of the domestic ngl industry and is adjacent to the largest concentration of refineries and petrochemical plants in the united states 
the facilities the company operates at mont belvieu include i one of the largest ngl fractionation facilities in the united states with an average production capacity of  barrels per day  ii the largest butane isomerization complex in the united states with an average isobutane production capacity of  barrels per day  iii one of the largest mtbe production facilities in the united states with an average production capacity of  barrels per day  and iv two propylene fractionation units with an average combined production capacity of  barrels per day 
the company owns all of the assets at its mont belvieu facility except for the ngl fractionation facility  in which it owns an effective economic interest see recent acquisitions below  one of the propylene fractionation units  in which it owns a interest and controls the remaining interest through a long term lease  the mtbe production facility  in which it owns a interest  and one of its three isomerization units and one deisobutanizer which are held under long term leases with purchase options 
the company also owns and operates approximately million barrels of storage capacity at mont belvieu and million barrels of storage capacity in petal  mississippi that are an integral part of its processing operations 
in addition  the company owns and operates a ngl fractionation facility in petal  mississippi with an average production capacity of  barrels per day 
the company also leases and operates one of only two commercial ngl import export terminals on the gulf coast 
as a result of the tejas natural gas liquids  llc tngl acquisition  the company acquired  effective august  o a year natural gas processing agreement with shell for the rights to process its current and future natural gas production from the state and federal waters of the gulf of mexico shell processing agreement  o varying interests in natural gas processing plants including one under construction with a combined gross capacity of billion cubic feet per day bcfd and net capacity of bcfd  o four ngl fractionation facilities with a combined gross capacity of  bpd and net capacity of  bpd  and o four ngl storage facilities with approximately million barrels of gross capacity and million barrels of net capacity 
lastly  the company has operating and non operating ownership interests in over  miles of ngl pipelines along the gulf coast including an interest in the  mile dixie pipeline 
all references herein to shell  unless the context indicates otherwise  shall refer collectively to shell oil company  its subsidiaries and affiliates 
recent acquisitions tngl acquisition 
as noted above  effective august   the company acquired tngl from tejas energy  llc tejas energy  now coral energy llc  an affiliate of shell  in exchange for million non distribution bearing  convertible special partner units special units of the company and a cash payment of million 
the company also agreed to issue up to million non distribution bearing  convertible special units contingency units to shell in the future if the volumes of natural gas that the company processes for shell reach certain agreed upon levels in and the businesses acquired from shell include natural gas processing and ngl fractionation  transportation and storage in louisiana and mississippi and its ngl supply and merchant business 
the assets acquired include varying interests in natural gas processing plants  four ngl fractionation facilities  and four ngl storage facilities and operator and non operator ownership interests in approximately  miles of ngl pipelines 
the company accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method 
the company s major customer related to the tngl assets is shell 
under the terms of the shell processing agreement  the company has the right to process substantially all of shell s current and future natural gas production from the gulf of mexico 
this includes natural gas production from the developments currently referred to as deepwater 
generally  the shell processing agreement grants the company the following rights and obligations o the exclusive right to process any and all of shell s gulf of mexico natural gas production from existing and future dedicated leases  plus o the right to all title  interest  and ownership in the raw make extracted by the company s gas processing facilities from shell s natural gas production from such leases  with o the obligation to deliver to shell the natural gas stream after the raw make is extracted 
natural gas processing plants are generally located near the production area 
when produced at the wellhead  natural gas generally must be processed to separate the merchantable  pipeline quality natural gas principally methane  from ngls and other impurities 
wet or rich natural gas normally must be processed to render the natural gas acceptable for transport in the nation s gas pipeline distribution system and to meet specifications required by local natural gas distribution companies 
after being extracted in the field  mixed ngls  sometimes referred to as y grade or raw make are typically transported to a central facility for fractionation and subsequent sale 
mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility 
effective july   a subsidiary of the operating partnership acquired an additional interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility from kinder morgan operating lp a kinder morgan for a purchase price of approximately million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
an additional interest in the same facility was purchased from epco for a cash purchase price of million 
this acquisition referred to as the mba acquisition increased the company s effective economic interest in the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility from to 
as a result of this acquisition  the results of operations after july  were consolidated rather than included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
industry environment because certain ngl products compete with other refined petroleum products in the fuel and petrochemical feedstock markets  ngl product prices are set by or in competition with refined petroleum products 
increased production and importation of ngls and ngl products in the united states may decrease ngl product prices in relation to refined petroleum alternatives and thereby increase consumption of ngl products as ngl products are substituted for other more expensive refined petroleum products 
conversely  a decrease in the production and importation of ngls and ngl products could increase ngl product prices in relation to refined petroleum product prices and thereby decrease consumption of ngls 
however  because of the relationship of crude oil and natural gas production to ngl production  the company believes any imbalance in the prices of ngls and ngl products and alternative products would be temporary 
when the price of crude oil nears a multiple of ten or higher to the price of natural gas ie  crude oil per barrel and natural gas per thousand cubic feet mcf  ngl pricing has been strong due to increased use in manufacturing petrochemicals 
in  the industry experienced a multiple of approximately nine ie  crude oil averaged per barrel based on averages of published cushing oklahoma prices and natural gas averaged per mcf based on averages of published henry hub prices  which caused petrochemical manufacturing demand to change from a preference for crude oil derivatives to a reliance on ngls 
in  when the multiple was approximately seven  petrochemical manufacturing demand relied on crude oil derivatives which depressed ngl prices 
this change resulted in the increasing of both the production and pricing of ngls 
in the ngl industry  revenues and cost of goods sold can fluctuate significantly up or down based on current ngl prices 
however  operating margins will generally remain constant except for the effect of inventory price adjustments or increased operating expenses 
results of operation of the company historically  the company has had only one reportable business segment ngl operations 
due to the broadened scope of the company s operations with the acquisition of tngl in the third quarter of  the company s operations are being managed using the following five reportable business segments to better reflect the earnings and activities in each of the company s major lines of business o fractionation o pipeline o processing o octane enhancement o other fractionation includes ngl fractionation  polymer grade propylene fractionation and butane isomerization converting normal butane into high purity isobutane services 
pipeline consists of pipeline  storage and import export terminal services 
processing includes the natural gas processing business and its related ngl merchant activities 
octane enhancement represents the company s ownership interest in a facility that produces motor gasoline additives to enhance octane currently producing mtbe 
the other operating segment consists of fee based marketing services and other plant support functions 
the management of the company evaluates segment performance on the basis of gross operating margin 
gross operating margin reported for each segment represents earnings before depreciation  lease expense obligations retained by the company s largest unitholder  epco  and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  segment gross operating margin is exclusive of interest expense  interest income from unconsolidated affiliates or others  dividend income from unconsolidated affiliates  minority interest  extraordinary charges and other income and expense transactions 
the company s equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates are included in segment gross operating margin 
segment gross operating margin is inclusive of intersegment revenues 
such revenues  which have been eliminated from the consolidated totals  are recorded at arms length prices which are intended to approximate the prices charged to external customers 
segment assets consists of property  plant and equipment and the amount of investments in and advances to equity and cost method investees 
the company s gross operating margins by segment in thousands along with a reconciliation to consolidated operating income over the past three years were as follows year ended december  gross operating margin by segment fractionation    pipeline    processing   octane enhancement    other   gross operating margin total    depreciation and amortization    retained lease expense  net    loss gain on sale of assets selling  general  and administrative expenses    consolidated operating income    the company s significant plant production and other volumetric data in thousands of barrels per day over the past three years are follows year ended december  plant production data fractionation mont belvieu ngl fractionation mont belvieu isomerization mont belvieu propylene production norco ngl fractionation a processing gas processing plants equity production a octane enhancement mtbe production other volumetric data pipeline houston ship channel distribution system louisiana pipeline distribution system a assets acquired in tngl acquisition effective august   rates shown are post acquisition year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
the company s revenues increased by to  million in compared to million in the company s costs and expenses increased by to  million in versus million in operating income before selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the principal factor behind the million increase in operating income before sg a was the tngl acquisition 
earnings attributable to these assets from the date of acquisition  august   through december  added approximately million in gross operating margin to the company s financial performance 
the other primary source of the increase was an overall improvement in ngl product prices in over levels 
fractionation 
the company s gross operating margin for the fractionation segment increased to million in from million in the increase is associated with a number of factors including o an overall improvement in the isomerization business due to an increase in production volumes and higher pricing in the first half of o the addition of the norco ngl fractionation facility operating results acquired in the tngl acquisition  o higher earnings in the propylene production business stemming from a rebound in propylene prices and an increase in propylene production  and o the mba acquisition on the financial results of the mont belvieu ngl fractionation business 
of the million increase in gross operating margin  million is attributable to the improvement in the isomerization business 
the primary reason for this improvement is an increase in production rates  which were accompanied by exceptional pricing conditions in the first half of the normal butane spread averaged cents per gallon in the first of half and cents per gallon for as a whole compared to cents per gallon for the company s gross operating margin on its propylene production facilities increased million in generally due to increases in polymer grade propylene prices and higher production rates 
spot prices of polymer grade propylene averaged cents per pound in compared to an average of cents per pound for also  the gross operating margin on the company s mont belvieu ngl fractionation facilities increased million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the consolidation of an additional of the operations of the mont belvieu ngl fractionation facility as a result of the mba acquisition 
lastly  the norco ngl fractionation facility contributed million in gross operating margin since its acquisition effective august  in addition to the major business areas mentioned above  this segment reflects equity earnings from mba  brf  promix and brpc 
as noted previously  mba was acquired effective july  prior to this date  the company recorded its share of earnings from mba as equity income in an unconsolidated affiliate 
for the period prior to the acquisition date  the company recorded million in equity income from mba 
the brf facility commenced operations in july the company recorded a loss of million from brf operations during primarily due to operating and other startup expenses incurred prior to the commencement of operations 
also  the company recorded million in equity income from promix 
promix is engaged in the business of transporting  fractionating  storing and exchanging ngls in southern louisiana and was acquired in the tngl acquisition 
pre startup equity earnings from brpc  a joint venture with exxonmobil to build a propylene concentrator unit near baton rouge  louisiana  were insignificant 
the brpc facility is scheduled to start operations in the third quarter of pipeline 
the company s gross operating margin for the pipeline segment was million in as compared to million in earnings generated from the louisiana pipeline distribution system increased million on an increase in pipeline volumes 
throughput volumes increased from thousand barrels per day mbpd in to mbpd in on the pre tngl acquisition system 
with the post tngl acquisition volumes added  the throughput on a prorata basis from august  increased to mbpd 
the increase in earnings from the louisiana system was offset by declines in the company s houston ship channel distribution system of million and at the company s import terminal of million 
the decrease for both the houston ship channel distribution system on the company s import terminal are generally attributable to lower butane import volumes 
the gross operating margin of this segment includes equity income from epik  wilprise  tri states and belle rose 
equity income attributable to this segment increased from million in to million in equity income from epik increased to million in from million in the increase is attributable to s earnings being for a full fiscal year whereas the results were for july through december the company recorded a combined million in equity income from the wilprise  tri states  and belle rose systems 
individually  equity earnings from wilprise  tri states  and belle rose were million  million  and a loss of thousand  respectively 
the belle rose system was acquired in the tngl acquisition 
the remaining million increase in equity income is attributable to entell 
the operating partnership formed entell in march as a pipeline joint venture with tngl with each member having a ownership interest 
as a result of the tngl acquisition  the company acquired the remaining ownership interest of entell and now consolidates the operations of entell with those of the operating partnership 
for the period march  through august   the company recorded its earnings from entell as equity income in an unconsolidated affiliate 
processing 
the company s gross operating margin for processing was million in compared to a loss of million in of the increase  million is due to the gas processing operations acquired in the tngl acquisition effective august  the gas processing operations benefited from a favorable ngl pricing environment where the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices averaged to during the fourth quarter of octane enhancement 
the company s gross operating margin for octane enhancement decreased to million in from million in this segment consists entirely of the company s equity earnings and investment in bef  a joint venture facility that currently produces mtbe 
the decrease in equity earnings from bef can be attributed a million non cash write off in january of the unamortized balance of deferred start up costs 
the company s share of this non cash charge was million 
other 
the company s gross operating margin for the other segment was million in compared to a loss of million in beginning in  this segment includes fee based marketing services 
the company acquired its fee based marketing services business as part of the tngl acquisition 
for the period august  through december   this business earned million 
apart from this portion of the segment s operations  the gross margin contribution of the other aspects of this segment were insignificant in both and selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased to million in from million in sg a expenses of the company are covered by the administrative services fee found in epco agreement 
on july   the audit and conflicts committee of the general partner authorized an increase in the administrative services fee to million per month from the initial million per month 
the increased fees were effective august  beginning in january  the administrative services fee will increase to million per month plus accrued employee incentive plan costs to compensate epco for the additional sg a charges related to the additional administrative employees acquired in the tngl acquisition 
interest expense 
the company s interest expense increased to million in compared to million in while average debt levels remained generally consistent in compared to  interest expense increased due to the amortization of loan origination costs 
the company s debt service costs will increase in the future as a result of additional borrowings for possible acquisitions and working capital needs 
for a more complete discussion of the company s debt management strategy  see bank credit facilities and december universal shelf registration under the liquidity and capital resources section of this report 
dividend income from unconsolidated affiliates 
the company s investment in dixie and vesco are recorded using the cost method as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
in accordance with these guidelines  the company records as dividend income the cash distributions from these investments as opposed to showing equity earnings 
both the dixie and vesco investments were acquired as part of the tngl acquisition 
for  the company recorded dividend income from dixie and vesco in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues  costs and expenses and operating income 
the company s revenues decreased by to million in compared to  million in the company s costs and expenses  excluding selling  general  and administrative charges  decreased as well to million in from million in both revenues and costs of goods sold decreased dramatically from to due to sharp declines in average ngl prices during most of for example  isobutane prices decreased from an average of cents per gallon in to cents per gallon in operating income before sg a decreased to million in from million in the reduced operating income in is mainly due to the effect of declining ngl prices on inventory values and merchant values during fractionation 
the company s gross operating margin for the fractionation segment declined to million in from million in the decrease can be attributed to a number of factors including o for the isomerization business  inventory write downs  loss of marketing profits due to lower butane price spreads  and the decline of revenues on merchant activities  o for the propylene production business  declines in the prices of high purity and refinery grade propylene  reduced production volumes  and write downs on feedstock inventory  and o for the mont belvieu ngl fractionation business  lower toll processing fees charged to customers 
the majority of the million decline in fractionation gross operating margin was caused by a million decrease in the isomerization business for the reasons outlined above 
from a pricing standpoint  the butane price spreads ie  the difference between the average prices of isobutane and normal butane decreased from cents per gallon in to cents per gallon in as a result of the preference for crude oil derivative petrochemical feedstocks over ngls 
as a sign of further weakness in ngl prices  the company s gross operating margin on its propylene production facilities dropped million in from levels 
as with other ngl products  the pricing of propylene fell during for example  spot prices of polymer grade propylene dropped from an average of cents per pound in to cents per pound in the gross operating margin for the mont belvieu fractionation facilities declined to million in from million in excluding the positive effect of million in overhead expenses and support facility cost reimbursements from joint venture partners in 
if not for the partial offset of lowered operating expenses  the gross operating margin on the fractionation facilities would have dropped by million in due to lower toll processing fees 
on average  these fees were cents per gallon in versus cents per gallon in the lower ngl fractionation fees impacted equity income from mba as well causing a decrease of million from million in to million in pipeline 
the company s gross operating margin for the pipeline segment increased to million in from million in of the million increase  million is attributable to higher throughput rates on the houston ship channel distribution system due to higher butane import volumes 
another million of the increase is associated with a increase in volumes on the louisiana pipeline distribution system 
lastly  part of the increase stems from the company s investment in epik  which began operations in june epik generated million in equity income for the period june through december processing 
the company s gross operating margin for processing improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower operating expenses associated with the company s rail car activity 
octane enhancement 
the company s gross operating margin for octane enhancement improved to million in from million in this segment consists entirely of the company s equity earnings and investment in bef  a joint venture owning a facility that currently produces mtbe 
the improvement in equity earnings from bef can be attributed to decreased debt service costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the adoption of the epco agreement in july in conjunction with the company s ipo which fixed the reimbursable sg a expenses at million per month 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in and million in the million decline was primarily due to a decrease in the average debt outstanding during the first seven months of as compared to the same period of  and the prepayment of debt in conjunction with the ipo in july prepayment penalties on extinguishment of debt 
the company incurred a million extraordinary loss during the third quarter of in connection with the early extinguishment of debt assumed from epco in connection with the ipo 
the extraordinary loss was equal to remaining unamortized debt origination costs associated with such debt and make whole premiums payable in connection with the repayment of such debt 
pro forma impact of tngl and mba acquisitions as noted above under recent acquisitions  the company acquired tngl and mba in fiscal as a result of these acquisitions  revenues  operating costs and expenses  interest expense  and other amounts shown on the statements of consolidated operations for have increased significantly over the amounts shown for the following table presents certain unaudited pro forma information for the years ended december   and as if the acquisition of tngl and the mont belvieu fractionator facility from kinder morgan and epco been made as of the beginning of the periods presented revenues    net income    allocation of net income to limited partners    general partner  units used in earnings per unit calculations basic    diluted    income per unit before extraordinary item and minority interest basic diluted net income per unit basic diluted liquidity and capital resources general 
the company s primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures  and quarterly distributions to the partners 
the company expects to fund future cash distributions and maintenance capital expenditures with cash flows from operating activities 
capital expenditures for future expansion activities and asset acquisitions are expected to be funded with cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under the revolving bank credit facilities 
cash flows from operating activities were a million inflow for compared to a million outflow for the comparable period of cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect the effects of net income  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary items  equity income of unconsolidated affiliates and changes in working capital 
net income increased significantly as a result of improved overall margins and the tngl acquisition 
depreciation and amortization increased a combined million in primarily as a result of additional capital expenditures and the tngl and mont belvieu fractionator acquisitions the acquisitions in the third quarter of amortization expense increased by million primarily due to the amortization of the intangible asset associated with the shell processing agreement 
the shell processing agreement and the excess cost associated with the mba acquisition will be amortized over a year period at approximately million per year 
the net effect of changes in operating accounts from year to year is generally the result of timing of ngl sales and purchases near the end of the period 
cash outflows used in investing activities were million in and million for the comparable period of cash outflows included capital expenditures of million for and million for included in the capital expenditures amounts are maintenance capital expenditures of million for and million for investing cash outflows in also included million in advances to and investments in unconsolidated affiliates versus million for the million increase stems primarily from contributions made to the wilprise  tri states  brf  and brpc joint ventures located in louisiana 
also  the company received million in payments on notes receivable from the bef and mba notes purchased during with the proceeds of the company s ipo 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the mba interest in the mont belvieu fractionation facility  million was received during the third quarter from mba for the balance of the company s note receivable 
the million outstanding balance of notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates relates to the participation in the bef note 
this balance will be collected in equal installments of approximately million each at the end of february and may cash outflows for investing activities also include the cash payments related to the acquisitions 
per the terms of the tngl acquisition  million was paid to tejas energy in september likewise  million was paid to kinder morgan and epco to purchase their collective interest in mba 
as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  on february  the company announced the acquisition of the lou tex propylene pipeline and other assets effective march  from concha chemical pipeline company concha  an affiliate of shell  for approximately million in cash 
the pipeline consists of miles of pipeline from sorrento  louisiana to mont belvieu  texas 
it is currently dedicated to the transportation of chemical grade propylene from sorrento to the mont belvieu area 
the acquisition of the lou tex propylene pipeline is the first step in the company s development of an approximately million   barrel per day louisiana to texas gas liquids pipeline system 
the second step involves the construction of the mile lou tex ngl pipeline from sorrento  louisiana to mont belvieu  texas  scheduled for completion in the third quarter of this larger system will link growing supplies of ngls produced in louisiana and mississippi with the principal ngl markets on the united states gulf coast 
on february   the company offered to buy the remaining ownership interests in dixie from the other seven owners for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the offer is subject to the acceptance by the holders of a minimum of of the oustanding ownership interests 
the offer will expire on march  if it is not accepted by such holders 
if the offer is accepted  the purchase would be subject to  among other things  preparation and execution of a definitive purchase agreement and the obtaining of requisite regulatory approvals and consents 
cash flows from financing activities were a million inflow in versus a million inflow for cash flows from financing activities are affected primarily by repayments of long term debt  borrowings under the long term debt agreements and distributions to the partners 
the period reflects the transactions that occurred in the ipo in july the period includes million in long term debt borrowings associated with the tngl and mont belvieu fractionation facility acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities for also reflected the net purchase of million of common units by a consolidated trust 
the operating partnership is planning to borrow million in march from the mississippi business finance corporation mbfc to reimburse the company s portion of construction costs of the pascagoula gas processing plant 
mbfc will issue million in taxable industrial development bonds underwritten by first union securities  inc and banc of america securities  llc 
the company will act as guarantor of the mbfc bonds with the operating partnership making payments of principal and interest to mbfc 
interest on the bonds will be paid semiannually with final maturity of the bonds in march future capital expenditures 
the company estimates that its share of capital expenditures in the projects of its unconsolidated affiliates will be approximately million in fiscal including million for the brpc propylene fractionator 
in addition  the company forecasts that million will be spent in on capital projects that will be recorded as property  plant  and equipment including million for construction of the lou tex ngl pipeline and million for the construction of processing facilities acquired from tngl 
the company expects to finance these expenditures out of operating cash flows  borrowings under its bank credit facilities  and offerings of debt and or equity securities 
as of december   the company had million in outstanding purchase commitments attributable to its capital projects 
of this amount  million is associated with capital projects which will be recorded as additional investments in unconsolidated affiliates for accounting purposes 
distributions and dividends from unconsolidated affiliates distributions from unconsolidated affiliates 
the company received million in distributions from its equity method investees in compared to million in distributions to the company from mba were million in and million in the level of distributions from mba is lower in versus due to a decrease in ngl fractionation margins and the acquisition of mba by the operating partnership effective july  distributions from bef were million in versus million in distributions from bef are lower in due to downtime associated with maintenance activities 
distributions from epik were million in versus million for epik was formed in the second quarter of and had no distributions until the third quarter of the company received million collectively from its newly acquired equity investments in promix and belle rose 
the promix and belle rose distributions to the company were million and million  respectively

debt ratings 
in january  the company received investment grade debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s investor services relating to the potential debt securities of the operating partnership covered under the registration statement and bank revolvers a and b 
standard poor s issued a bbb rating to the company s two bank revolvers and a preliminary bbb senior unsecured debt rating to the million universal shelf registration 
generally  a company given a standard poor s rating of bbb or higher is regarded as having financial security characteristics that outweigh its vulnerabilities  and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments 
the outlook for the standard poor s ratings is stable 
moody s investor services issued a rating of baa to the company s bank revolvers and a first time senior unsecured debt rating of baa with a stable outlook to the million universal shelf registration 
a ranking of baa from moody s investor services entails that a company offers adequate financial security  however  certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time 
a ranking of baa as opposed to baa means that a company ranks on the lower end of its rating category 
as a result of the acquisition of the favorable debt ratings  the company was allowed to reduce its eurodollar interest rates on the million and million bank credit facilities by 
in accordance with the terms of the revolvers 
long term incentive plan effective january   enterprise products gp  llc  the general partner of the company  adopted the long term incentive plan the plan 
under the plan  non qualified incentive options to purchase a fixed number of common units may be granted to key employees of epco who perform management  administrative or operational functions for the company under the epco agreement

upon the exercise of an option  the company may deliver the units or pay an amount in cash equal to the excess of the fair market value of a unit and the exercise price of the option 
on january    options were granted at a weighted average price of per unit of which none had been exercised at february  the plan is primarily funded by the units purchased by the trust 
since the common units held by the trust were previously unallocated  they were excluded from the earnings per unit calculation

mtbe production general 
the company owns a economic interest in the bef partnership that owns the mtbe production facility located within the company s mont belvieu complex 
the production of mtbe is driven by oxygenated fuels programs enacted under the federal clean air act amendments of and other legislation 
any changes to these programs that enable localities to opt out of these programs  lessen the requirements for oxygenates or favor the use of non isobutane based oxygenated fuels reduce the demand for mtbe and could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
recent regulatory developments 
see discussion of octane enhancement recent regulatory developments above 
alternative uses of the bef facility 
in light of these regulatory developments  the company is formulating a contingency plan for use of the bef facility if mtbe were banned or significantly curtailed 
management is exploring a possible conversion of the bef facility from mtbe production to alkylate production 
at present the forecast cost of this conversion would be in the million to million range  with the company s share being million to million 
management anticipates that if mtbe is banned alkylate demand will rise as producers use it to replace mtbe as an octane enhancer 
alkylate production would be expected to generate spot market margins comparable to those of mtbe 
greater alkylate production would be expected to increase isobutane consumption nationwide and result in improved isomerization margins for the company 
results of year readiness program successful outcome of year readiness program 
management is pleased to announce that the company s efforts at preparing its computer systems for the year were successful and that no significant problems were encountered 
the year readiness team reported that all systems functioned properly as the date changed from december  to january  the company is also pleased to note that no problems were reported to it by its customers or vendors as a result of the year issue 
the company continues to be vigilant in monitoring its systems for any potential year problems that may arise in the short term 
there is no assurance that residual year issues will not arise in the future which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
history of year readiness program and costs 
in  epco began assessing the impact of year compliance issues on the software and hardware used by the company 
a team was assembled to review and document the status of epco s and the company s systems for year compliance 
the key information systems reviewed include the company s pipeline supervisory control and data acquisition scada system  plant  storage  and other pipeline operating systems 
in connection with each of these areas  consideration was given to hardware  operating systems  applications  data base management  system interfaces  electronic transmission  and outside vendors 
as of november  work was complete in all areas 
pursuant to the epco agreement  any selling  general and administrative costs related to year compliance issues were covered by the annual administrative services fee paid by the company to epco 
consequently  only those costs incurred in connection with year compliance which relate to operational information systems and hardware were paid directly by the company 
epco spent approximately  in connection with year compliance 
the company incurred expenditures of approximately  in connection with finalizing its year compliance project principally the scada system 
these cost estimates do not include the internal costs of epco s or the company s previously existing resources and personnel that might have been partially used for year compliance or cost of normal system upgrades which also included various year compliance features or fixes 
such internal costs were determined to be insignificant to the total estimated cost of year compliance for both entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates with respect to its debt obligations and changes in commodity prices 
the company may use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate these risks 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

the company will enter into risk management transactions to manage price risk  basis risk  physical risk or other risks related to energy commodities on both a short term less than days and long term basis  not to exceed months

interest rate risk 
at december  and  the company had no derivative instruments in place to cover any potential interest rate risk on its variable rate debt obligations 
variable interest rate debt obligations do expose the company to possible increases in interest expense and decreases in earnings if interest rates were to rise 
all of the company s long term debt is at variable interest rates 
if the weighted average base interest rates selected on long term debt in were to have been higher than the weighted average of the actual base interest rates selected  assuming no changes in weighted average variable debt levels  interest expense would have increased by approximately million with a corresponding decrease in earnings before minority interest 
for  if the weighted average base rates had been higher than those actually selected  interest expense would have been million higher with a corresponding decrease in earnings before minority interest 
at december  and  the company had million and million invested in cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
all cash equivalent investments other than cash are highly liquid  have original maturities of less than three months  and are considered to have insignificant interest rate risk 
commodity price risk 
the company is exposed to commodity price risk through its ngl businesses acquired in the tngl acquisition effective august  in order to effectively manage this risk  the company may enter into swaps  forwards  commodity futures  options and other derivative commodity instruments with similar characteristics that are permitted by contract or business custom to be settled in cash or with another financial instrument 
the purpose of these risk management activities is to hedge exposure to price risks associated with natural gas  ngl inventories  commitments and certain anticipated transactions 
the table below presents the hypothetical changes in fair values arising from immediate selected potential changes in the quoted market prices of derivative commodity instruments outstanding at december  gain or loss on these derivative commodity instruments would be offset by a corresponding gain or loss on the hedged commodity positions  which are not included in the table 
the fair value of the commodity futures at december  and february  was estimated at million payable and million payable  respectively  based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been settled at the balance sheet date 
the increase in fair value of the commodity futures payable is primarily due to an increase in volumes hedged  change in composition of commodities hedged and higher ngl product prices 
millions of dollars no change increase decrease impact of changes in quoted fair fair increase fair increase market prices on value value decrease value decrease commodity futures at december  at february  for a further discussion of the risk management activities and accounting for derivative commodity and other financial instruments  please see notes and to the consolidated financial statements
