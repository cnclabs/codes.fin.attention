item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations going concern considerations the company has suffered losses from operations in and is in default of its debt obligations 
consequently the company s december  balance sheet reflects a net working capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to meet its financial needs during  the company must obtain some form of debt or equity financing or combination thereof  or complete a sale of assets  a merger or other transaction 
presently  management is attempting to raise funds to pay down its bank debt 
the overdue principal payments totaling approximately  are currently due on the earlier of may  or the closing of the transaction contemplated by the stock purchase agreement with snpe  inc  discussed below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
the company is actively pursuing a common stock sale through the form of a definitive stock purchase agreement 
however  there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its fund raising efforts or  if successful  that it will be able to successfully restructure or refinance its existing debt obligations 
in conjunction with attempts to secure financing  the company may need to initiate further reductions in its workforce and other areas of costs to reduce future financial obligations 
general dynamic materials corporation dmc or the company is a worldwide leader in explosive metalworking and  through its new aerospace group  is involved in a variety of metal forming  machining  welding  and assembly activities 
the explosive metalworking business includes the use of explosives to perform metallurgical bonding  or metal cladding and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
the company performs metal cladding using its proprietary dynaclad and detaclad r technologies 
the company s revenues from its explosive metalworking businesses  as a proportion of total company revenues  have declined as a result a significant slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate and the acquisitions of amk welding  spin forge and precision machined products 
the company s aerospace group was formed from these three acquisitions and accounted for and of the company s revenues and revenues  respectively 
explosive metalworking 
clad metal products are used in manufacturing processes or environments that involve highly corrosive chemicals  high temperatures and or high pressure conditions 
for example  the company fabricates clad metal tube sheets for heat exchangers 
heat exchangers are used in a variety of high temperature  high pressure  highly corrosive chemical processes  such as processing crude oil in the petrochemical industry and processing chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers 
in addition  the company has produced titanium clad plates used in the fabrication of metal autoclaves to replace autoclaves made of brick and lead for two customers in the mining industry 
the company believes that its clad metal products are an economical  high performance alternative to the use of sol id corrosion resistant alloys 
in addition to clad metal products  the explosive metalworking business includes shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
aerospace manufacturing 
formed metal products are made from sheet metal and forgings that are subsequently formed into precise  three dimensional shapes that are held to tight tolerances 
metal forming is accomplished through the use of traditional forming technologies  including spinning  machining  rolling and hydraulic expansion 
dmc also performs welding services utilizing a variety of manual and automatic welding techniques that include electron beam and gas tungsten arc welding processes 
the company s forming and welding operations are often performed to support the manufacture of completed assemblies and sub assemblies required by its customers 
fabrication and assembly services are performed utilizing the company s close tolerance machining  forming  welding  inspection and other special service capabilities 
the company s forming  machining  welding and assembly operations serve a variety of product applications in the commercial aircraft  aerospace  defense and power generation industries 
product applications include tactical missile motor cases  titanium pressure tanks for launch vehicles  and complex  high precision component parts for satellites 
the company completed three separate business acquisitions during on january   the company acquired certain assets of amk welding  inc amk 
amk supplies commercial aircraft and aerospace related automatic and manual  gas tungsten and arc welding services 
on march   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of spin forge  llc spin forge 
the company s management believes spin forge is one of the country s leading manufacturers of tactical missile motor cases and titanium pressure vessels for the commercial aerospace and defense industries 
on december   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of precision machined products  inc pmp 
pmp is a contract machining shop specializing in high precision  high quality  complex machined parts used in the aerospace  satellite and high technology industries 
on january   the board of directors of dmc declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common stock 
the dividend was paid on january   the rights record date  to the stockholders of record on that date 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from dmc one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value 
per share  of dmc at a purchase price of  subject to adjustment 
on june   the company announced that it had entered into an asset sale agreement to sell certain assets of its explosive metalworking group to ametek  inc ametek for an approximate purchase price of million 
company management believed that the sale of dmc s explosive metalworking business would enable the company to eliminate the majority of its outstanding debt  thus strengthening the company s balance sheet and enabling the company to focus its business strategy on consolidating suppliers in the aerospace industry through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the closing of the transaction was expected to occur during the latter part of  pending the satisfaction of certain conditions 
however  in a letter dated october   ametek notified the company that it was terminating the asset purchase agreement between the two companies 
the company does not believe that ametek had a legal basis for terminating the agreement and is evaluating its course of action relating to such termination 
due largely to the operating loss the company incurred during  the company violated certain financial covenants under its debt agreements 
once it became apparent that ametek might terminate the asset purchase agreement and that financial covenant violations under its debt agreements would continue  the company began to evaluate various business strategies and financing alternatives in connection with the need to restructure its debt agreements and or re capitalize the company s balance sheet 
these efforts culminated in the company entering into a stock purchase agreement the agreement with snpe  inc snpe that was signed on january  under the agreement  snpe would make a million cash payment to the company in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share and would lend the company an additional million under a convertible subordinated note that carries a interest rate  is due five years from date of issuance and is convertible into common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share 
snpe currently owns of the company s outstanding common stock and would acquire a controlling interest in the company as a result of the proposed transaction 
the proposed transaction is subject to approval by the company s stockholders and certain regulatory approvals 
company management believes that the necessary stockholder and regulatory approvals will be received and expects to close the transaction in the second quarter of in  the company experienced significant operating losses as a result of a significant slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate and non recurring charges associated with plant closing costs  new facility start up costs  asset impairment write downs and expenses incurred in connection with efforts to sell the explosive metalworking group 
the company expects the reduced demand for these products to continue at least through the company also experienced  and expects to continue to experience  quarterly fluctuations in operating results caused by various factors  including the timing and size of orders from major customers  customer inventory levels  shifts in product mix  the occurrence of acquisition and divestiture related costs  and general economic conditions 
the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
in addition  the company uses numerous suppliers of alloys  steels and other materials for its operations 
the company typically bears a short term risk of alloy  steel and other component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
although the company will work with customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of any component shortages  component shortages have had  and are expected from time to time to have  short term adverse effects on the company s business 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for decreased to  from  in the company s new aerospace group  which was formed in as a result of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp  contributed  to sales of total sales sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this increase in aerospace group sales is largely due to the december  acquisition of pmp whose results are included in aerospace group sales for all of but only one month of the increase in aerospace group sales was more than offset by a  decline in sales by the company s explosion metalworking group 
sales by this group  whose operations include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased from  in of total sales to  in of total sales 
the large decrease in explosive metalworking group sales reflects a significant slowdown in global market demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate that is expected to continue for the year gross profit 
as a result of the sharp decline in the company s net sales  gross profit for decreased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a decline from the gross profit margin of in gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group decreased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to from in the large decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to unfavorable fixed manufacturing overhead cost variances associated with the sharp declines in production and sales of clad plates 
fixed manufacturing overhead costs for the explosive metalworking group have been significantly reduced through the july closing of the group s colorado manufacturing facility and consolidation of all of the group s manufacturing activities in its new mount braddock  pennsylvania plant 
the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group reflects a decrease in year to year sales at spin forge and related unfavorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses into cost of products sold 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase includes a  increase in direct aerospace group general and administrative expenses 
the increase in direct general and administrative expenses of the aerospace group relates to the timing of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp that were completed on january  march and december   respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in this increased percentage is largely attributable to the significant decrease in sales by the explosive metalworking group 
selling expense 
selling expenses decreased by to  in from  in this decrease reflects lower expense levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  advertising and promotion  reserves for bad debts and travel and entertainment expenses 
compensation and benefit expense decreases are associated with reduced staffing levels in response to the decline in demand for explosion bonded clad metal plate 
however  due to the decrease in sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from in to in start up costs 
in the third quarter of  the company began to separately report the start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility in pennsylvania for the manufacture of clad metal plates 
start up costs increased from  in to  in these start up costs included salaries  benefits and travel expenses for company employees assigned to this project  field office expenses and other operating expenses directly associated with this construction project 
the new facility commenced operations in august at which time all operating costs associated with this new facility began to be recorded as manufacturing overhead that is included in the computation of cost of products sold 
plant closing costs 
on april   the company announced that it would be closing its louisville  colorado based explosion bonded clad metal plate manufacturing facility in the third quarter of and consolidating all of its explosive metalworking group operations into the new pennsylvania based clad metal plate manufacturing facility 
for the year ended december   the company recorded non recurring charges of  related to costs associated with this plant closing 
plant closing costs include severance pay to terminated employees  outplacement service fees and certain expenses incurred in connection with final plant shutdown  clean up and site reclamation work subsequent to the discontinuation of manufacturing activities at this facility in july 
impairment of long lived assets 
in connection with the plant closing discussed above  the company identified certain long lived assets associated with its colorado manufacturing operations that were to be abandoned and that had negligible fair market values 
accordingly  the company recorded asset impairment write down charges in the aggregate amount of  during the company also identified certain inventory that was determined to have little value as a result of the plant closing 
this inventory  which totaled approximately  was consequently written off in as a charge to cost of products sold 
costs related to attempted asset disposition 
on june   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell certain assets relating to its explosive metalworking group to ametek for approximately million 
however  on october   ametek notified the company that it was terminating the asset purchase agreement 
in connection with the company s efforts during to sell its explosive metalworking group  the company recorded non recurring expenses of  these expenses related principally to investment banking  legal and other third party fees associated with the terminated ametek transaction 
income loss from operations 
the company reported a  loss from operations in compared to income from operations of  in the operating loss is a result of the decrease in net sales discussed above and non recurring charges in the aggregate amount of  associated with plant closing costs  new facility start up costs  asset impairment write downs and expenses incurred in connection with efforts to sell the explosive metalworking group 
the company s aerospace group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in  with this decrease being largely attributable to unfavorable product mix changes that resulted decreased gross margin levels 
the explosive metalworking group reported a loss from operations of  in  including  of non recurring expenses associated with new facility start up costs  plant closing costs and asset impairment write downs  as compared to income from operations of  in non recurring corporate costs in the amount of  that were incurred in connection with the attempted sale of the explosive metalworking group were not allocated to either of the company s two business segments in computing the above business segment income loss from operations amounts for interest expense 
interest expense increased by to  in from  in this large increase is attributable to borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit with the company s bank that were required to finance the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp and that were outstanding for a full year in and to interest expense under the company s industrial development revenue bonds that were used to finance the new clad metal plate manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
interest expense on the bonds was capitalized during the construction period  which ended on august   and expensed thereafter as the facility became operational 
income tax provision 
due to losses before income taxes and the ability to carry back the major portion of these losses to prior years in which the company generated taxable income  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in as compared to a tax provision of  in the effective tax rates for recording the tax benefit and the tax provision were and  respectively 
the tax loss exceeded the amount of federal tax that can be carried back to the and tax years and the company did not recognize a tax benefit with respect to the portion of the tax loss that can be carried forward 
additionally  the tax loss cannot be carried back for state tax purposes 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the effective tax benefit rate for was significantly lower than the company s effective tax rate for net income loss 
the company recorded a net loss of  in as compared to net income of  in the significant decrease in net earnings was primarily attributable to decreased gross profit from the company s explosion metalworking group  non recurring expenses in the aggregate amount of  associated with plant closing costs  new facility start up costs  asset impairment write downs and expenses incurred in connection with efforts to sell the explosive metalworking group and increased interest expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in the company s new aerospace group  which was formed in as a result of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp  contributed  to sales and thus accounted for the entire sales increase 
sales by the company s explosion metalworking group  which includes explosion bonding of clad metal  explosively formed metal products and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased from  in to  in this decrease reflects a decrease in sales of explosively formed products to  in from  in due to a significant reduction in orders from a customer that accounts for a majority of such sales 
as a result of this customer no longer ordering explosively formed parts from the company  the company expects sales of explosively formed products to be less than  in gross profit 
as a result of the company s increase in net sales  gross profit for increased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a decline from the gross profit margin of in gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group decreased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the new aerospace group was 
the large decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosion metalworking group is principally due to proportionately lower sales of explosively formed products that carry significantly higher margins than sales of clad metal plates 
as discussed above  a large explosion forming customer no longer orders product from the company and sales of explosively formed products are expected to be less than  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the largest portion of this increase relates to  of new general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of amk  spin forge and pmp which were acquired on january   march  and december   respectively 
expenses in also include  of non recurring expenses relating to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in to support a full year of operations for the three aerospace group acquisitions and other strategic business initiatives 
after adjustment for non recurring expenses related to the departure of the company s former ceo  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in selling expense 
selling expenses decreased by to  in from  in this decrease reflects lower expense levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  advertising and promotion  and consulting 
decreases in these categories were partially offset by an increase in the provision for bad debts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts increased from  as of december  to  as of december  due to a specific provision in the amount of  for an outstanding receivable from a customer that was experiencing significant financial difficulty 
the customer filed for bankruptcy in and the company was required to record a write off for the full amount of the receivable during since liquidation proceeds from the bankruptcy proceeding were inadequate to satisfy any obligations to unsecured creditors 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in start up costs 
in the third quarter of  the company began to separately report the start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility in pennsylvania for the manufacture of clad metal plates 
start up costs for totaled  and include salaries  benefits and travel expenses for company employees assigned to this project  field office expenses and other operating expenses directly associated with this project 
the company will continue to incur and separately report start up costs in until the new facility commences operations during the last half of income from operations 
income from operations decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is a direct result of decreased sales and gross profits from the company s explosion metalworking group  non recurring expenses in the amount of  relating to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer  and  in start up costs discussed above 
income from operations in for the company s explosion metalworking group and aerospace group was  and  respectively  versus income from operations of  that was generated entirely by the explosion metalworking group 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased more than threefold to  in from  in this increase is due to borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit with keybank of colorado that were required to finance the amk  spin forge and pmp acquisitions 
interest expense is expected to increase in as a result of revolving credit loans used to finance the pmp acquisition being outstanding for the full year and the initial recording of interest expense on the industrial development revenue bond financing for the new pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
interest on the industrial development revenue bonds is being capitalized during the construction period and will not be expensed until the new facility becomes operational during the second half of income tax provision 
the company s income tax provision decreased by to  in from  in  and follows the decrease in income from operations and income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in and in net income 
net income decreased by to  in from  in and  as a percentage of net sales  was in compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross profit from the company s explosion metalworking group and increased general and administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has obtained most of its operational financing from a combination of operating activities and an asset backed revolving credit facility 
due primarily to the operating loss the company incurred during  the company violated certain financial covenants under both its revolving credit facility and the reimbursement agreement related to the letter of credit supporting payment of principal and interest under the company s industrial revenue development bonds the bonds  used to finance the construction of its manufacturing facilities in pennsylvania 
the company has entered into an agreement with its bank under which i certain principal payments due september   december  and march  totaling approximately  have been deferred until the earlier of may  or the closing date of the transaction with snpe  inc described below  ii covenant defaults under both the revolving credit facility and reimbursement agreement are waived until may   iii interest rates on the revolving credit facility have been increased to prime plus on the acquisition and working capital lines and prime plus on the accommodation line  and iv maximum borrowings permitted under the working capital line have been decreased to from million to million 
the working capital line expires by its terms on november  as of december   borrowings outstanding under the million revolving credit line totaled million on the acquisition line  million on the accommodation line and million on the working capital line  and borrowings outstanding on the bonds totaled approximately million 
in january of  the company used proceeds from the sale of its louisville  colorado manufacturing facility to pay the acquisition line down to million 
borrowings under the accommodation line remained at million and borrowings under the working capital line increased to million as of march  the company expects working capital borrowings to remain in the to million range until such time that the company is able to close the proposed transaction with snpe  inc since the current bank deferral and waiver extends only through may  and certain financial covenant violations are likely to continue beyond this date  all of the foregoing debt has been classified as a current liability in the company s december  financial statements 
on january   the company entered into the agreement with snpe under which snpe would acquire  shares of the company s common stock for a million cash payment and would lend the company an additional million pursuant to a convertible subordinated note due five years from the issue date 
completion of the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and approval by the stockholders of the company at a special meeting expected to occur in the second quarter of snpe currently owns of the company s common stock and would acquire a controlling interest in the company as a result of this transaction 
the company expects to complete the transaction in the second quarter of in anticipation of closing the snpe transaction  the company is in current discussions with its bank to amend both the revolving credit facility and reimbursement agreement with the bank 
amendment to both agreements would contain new financial covenants that reflect the company s current financial position and projected results for the year and the company expects the amended revolving credit facility to have a term of twelve to eighteen months and consist of a working capital component and a term component with fixed quarterly principal payments 
the current maturity schedule for the bonds is expected to remain unchanged 
there can be no assurance that the waivers and deferrals currently in effect will be extended  that the company will be successful in closing the transaction with snpe  or that it will be able to successfully restructure or refinance its existing debt obligations 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and funds the company expects to be available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its current operations at least until the snpe transaction is completed in the second quarter of if the bank were to refuse to amend the agreement as described above  or to make further funds available to the company as permitted under that agreement  the company s ability to meet its cash requirements would be adversely affected 
assuming that the proposed snpe transaction closes as expected  the company expects to utilize the million cash infusion to repay bank debt  finance working capital requirements and make selective capital investments 
company management believes that this cash infusion would enable the company to restructure its current credit facility and financial covenants relating to its bank credit agreement and the bonds to ensure compliance with underlying covenants or obtain replacement financing 
additionally  the company believes that proceeds from this contemplated equity sale  cash flow from its operations and funds expected to be available under a restructured or new credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its current business operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if this contemplated equity sale transaction does not close and the company is unsuccessful in restructuring its currently outstanding debt or obtaining replacement financing  the company may be required to liquidate certain assets outside of the normal course of business which could result in a loss on the disposition of those assets 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
year compliance the year issue is the result of many computer programs being written such that they will malfunction when reading a year of this problem could cause system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of business processes 
during the latter part of and throughout  the company pursued a two prong approach to the year issue 
the first prong involved an internal evaluation of the company s computer systems 
the second prong of the company s approach involved an integrated process of working with suppliers and customers to ensure that the flow of goods  services or payments would not be interrupted because of year issues 
tests performed by the company indicated that the company s computer hardware and software systems were year compliant  and the company did not encounter any problems during the transition to the year additionally  the company did not experience any disruption in the flow of goods  services or payments as a result of year problems encountered by suppliers and customers 
finally  the company did not incur any material costs because company employees performed all year compliance work
