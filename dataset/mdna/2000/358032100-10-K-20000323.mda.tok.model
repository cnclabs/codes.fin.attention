in addition  the company s quarterly results of operations have been  and may continue to be  materially impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and by restaurant closings 
the fourth quarter normally includes weeks of operations as compared with weeks for each of the three prior quarters 
the fourth quarter of will include weeks 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income in the fourth quarter are not comparable to results in each of the first three fiscal quarters  and net sales and income can be expected to decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
because of prior year operating losses  restaurant closures  the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter cannot be relied upon as indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year

although no series a preferred stock is currently outstanding  holders of series a preferred stock  if any  would be entitled to vote with common stockholders on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
when and if issued  the holders of a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock will have a separate right to approve certain corporate actions 
in fiscal  the company failed to achieve a specified earnings target before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of at least  which constituted an event of default of the terms of the preferred stock agreement and which triggered the right of the series a preferred stockholders to elect a majority of the company s board of directors 
the holder of the series b preferred stock has not initiated any action to convert such shares into shares of series a preferred stock nor has it exercised its right to elect a majority of the board of directors 
such holder has notified the company that it has no present intention of exercising such right  however  it has not waived any of its rights under the agreement

see business risks included herein 
the company believes its operating cash requirements and fiscal capital requirements can be met through existing cash balances  cash provided by operations and its borrowing arrangements 
the company may continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to provide greater flexibility toward improving its operating performance and resuming restaurant expansion 
inflation many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage could materially increase the company s labor costs 
in addition  the cost of food commodities utilized by the company are subject to market supply and demand pressures 
shifts in these costs may have a significant impact on the company s food costs 
the company anticipates that increases in these costs may be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there is no assurance that the company would be able to pass such costs on to its guests or that even if it were able to do so  it could do so in a short period of time 
year software requirements the company has completed a review of all its restaurant and corporate computer systems for compliance with the year the company has migrated its critical processing and information requirements to outsourced processing companies whose software is represented to be year compliant

the  cost for year compliance upgrades was capitalized in accordance with normal policy and was funded either through operating cash flow  equipment lease financing or borrowings under the company s loan and security agreement 
the company has completed surveying all of its vendors and has received confirmation that all programs and systems used by vendors are  or were expected to be  year compliant by year end 
the company believes it has an effective plan in place to anticipate and resolve any potential year issues  which have not yet occurred  in a timely manner 
the company transitioned to the year with no material disruption to its business 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt this statement for its fiscal year beginning january  the company does not expect that adoption of this statement will impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if market rates were to increase immediately by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings would not be materially affected as borrowings are primarily subject to variable interest rates
