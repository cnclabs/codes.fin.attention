item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earnings summary the company reported a net loss of  or basic and diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended september  this compares to net income of  basic and diluted net income per share in fiscal and  basic and diluted net income per share in fiscal results decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to charges to restructure the company s manufacturing operations by eliminating excess capacity  moving operations from mexico to thailand and closing the mexican facility 
the decrease is also due to operating losses generated by the acquired adflex operation and increased interest expense as a result of the adflex acquisition 
revenue related to the acquired adflex operation decreased throughout fiscal as a result of pre acquisition customer service and quality issues and the operations relatively high cost structure 
during fiscal  innovex took the steps necessary to turn the operation around 
the higher cost mexican facility was closed with operations being transferred to the expanded lower cost lamphun thailand facility and the manufacturing  customer service and quality areas were strengthened 
at the end of fiscal  the company began to see a resurgence of orders related to the acquired operation and as a result  expects improving revenue and operating results from the acquired adflex operation in fiscal fiscal results decreased in comparison to due to the increase in flexible circuit sales to the disk drive industry not offsetting the phase out of lead wire assembly revenue 
this was due in part to continued disk drive industry softness 
this softness appears to be the result of an over supply of disk drives and due to a reduction in the number of disk drives kept in inventory by computer manufacturers that have adopted a build to order business model 
also contributing to the sales decrease was a reduction in the average number of heads per disk drive 
this reduction is the result of an increasing number of low cost disk drives being sold and as a result of the use of magneto resistive mr and giant magneto resistive gmr disk drive heads which increase the storage capacity per disk drive platter and reduce the number of heads required to provide the same disk drive capacity 
the decrease in gross margin percent in fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of lower margin revenue related to the acquired adflex operation 
the acquisition related revenue generates a lower gross margin percent than innovex s high end flexible circuit revenue due to the higher material content of the assembly portion of the business and lower level of technical tolerances required 
gross margins for the acquired adflex operation are also lower due the higher level of fixed costs related to the operation 
the drop in gross margin percent during as compared to was due to several factors  the inclusion of weeks of lower margin adflex related sales  reduced yields and costs related to an aggressive new product ramp up in production concurrent with new flexible circuit capacity installation and due to lower shipments of lead wire assemblies reducing the leverage of the fixed overhead costs related to their production 
operating expenses were of revenue in fiscal as compared to and of revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal operating expenses is a result of amortization of intangibles related to the adflex acquisition and the acquisition of the company s thailand subcontractor and higher engineering expenses related to the development of a base material manufacturing process at the company s new maple plain facility 
the increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales for over is primarily due to increases in marketing  professional and legal expenses 
results of operations net sales 
the company s net sales of  for fiscal increased from fiscal net sales of  the increase in over was due  in part to the increase in flexible circuit revenue from the disk drive industry 
in addition  a large portion of the increase was due to revenue generated from the telecommunication  network system  consumer and other industries related to the august acquisition of adflex 
these increases offset a reduction in revenue generated from lead wire interconnects as the disk drive industry transitioned to integrated interconnects including the company s head interconnect flex hif and flex suspension assembly fsa 
less than of revenue for fiscal was generated by lead wire assemblies as compared to for fiscal net sales for fiscal were  a increase from net sales of  the increase in over was primarily due to the fourth quarter results including eight weeks of operating results related to the acquisition of adflex solutions  inc excluding the acquisition related revenue  net sales would have decreased by 
fiscal revenue was impacted by the transition of the disk drive industry from traditional lead wire interconnects to integrated interconnects including the company s head interconnect flex hif 
the large increase in these flexible circuit sales to the disk drive industry did not offset the phase out of lead wire assembly revenue 
this was due in part to continued disk drive industry softness as a result of an over supply of disk drives and due to a reduction in the number of disk drives kept in inventory by computer manufacturers that have adopted a build to order business model 
also contributing to the sales decrease was a reduction in the average number of heads per disk drive 
this reduction is the result of an increasing number of low cost disk drives being sold and as a result of the use of magneto resistive mr and giant magneto resistive gmr disk drive heads which increase the storage capacity per disk drive platter and reduce the number of heads required to provide the same disk drive capacity 
revenue from the disk drive industry generated of fiscal revenue and is expected to be a similar percentage during fiscal in addition  during fiscal  of the revenue was generated by flexible circuits for consumer applications  from network system applications  from telecommunications applications and from applications from other industries 
the acquisition of adflex has reduced the company s dependence on the disk drive industry significantly from its historical levels of of revenue 
fiscal should benefit from continued growth in the demand for high technology flexible circuit products including the company s hif and fsa 
significant progress has been made in gaining customer acceptance of the company s fsa product that will be integral to increasing revenue in fiscal export sales accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal as compared to for and for  reflecting the high level of interconnect shipments to electronic manufacturers in asia 
a significant portion of the remaining domestic sales are subsequently shipped internationally by the company s customers 
gross margin 
the company s gross profit as a percent of sales for fiscal decreased to  from the reported for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to fiscal including lower margin revenue related to the acquired adflex operation 
the acquisition related revenue generates a lower gross margin percent than the high end innovex flexible circuit revenue due to the higher material content of the assembly portion of the business and lower level of technical tolerances required 
gross margins for the acquired adflex operation are also lower due the level of fixed costs related to the operation 
the company anticipates growing gross margin percents on the pre acquisition innovex revenue during fiscal through improved yield performance and increased utilization of the high volume manufacturing facility 
gross margins on the revenue generated by the acquired operations are expected to improve as a result of the transfer of manufacturing operations from mexico to thailand and other cost saving initiatives 
the company s gross profit margin decreased to of sales in fiscal as compared to in the decrease in was partially due to the fourth quarter results including eight weeks of operating results related to the acquisition of adflex solutions  inc the adflex revenue generates a lower gross margin percent than the existing innovex flexible circuit revenue due to the higher material content of the assembly portion of the business and lower level of technical tolerances required 
gross margins for the pre purchase high end flexible circuit revenue were lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced yields and costs related to an aggressive new product ramp up in production concurrent with new capacity installation 
in addition  the fiscal gross margin percent decreased due to lower shipments of lead wire assemblies reducing the leverage of the fixed overhead costs related to their production 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in as compared to in and in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over is the result of the amortization of intangibles related to the adflex and the thailand subcontractor acquisitions 
the increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales for as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenue and an increase in marketing  professional and legal expenses 
increases in marketing expenses were incurred to expand efforts to diversify the company s revenue base and increases in professional services were due to consultants being retained to improve the manufacturing operation efficiency 
fiscal operating expenses should decrease as a percent of sales as a result of modest increases in spending offset by the expected increase in revenue from the company s fsa product and other new product applications 
engineering expense increased to of net sales in fiscal from in and in the increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales for fiscal is due to an increase in engineering expense related to the development of base material manufacturing process in the new maple plain minnesota facility 
engineering spending remained relatively stable in fiscal as compared to the fiscal and spending was concentrated on fsa development and the development of a process to manufacture material for use in producing double sided  plated through hole flexible circuits 
fiscal engineering spending is expected to concentrate on technologies related to the material producing capability  fsa capabilities  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development 
restructuring charges 
a restructuring charge of  was recorded during the first quarter of fiscal related to the restructuring of the company s manufacturing operations 
the restructuring is primarily related to moving operations from the company s agua prieta  mexico facility to its new facility in lamphun  thailand 
the majority of this charge includes employee severance  asset impairment of property and equipment and facility abandonment costs 
the restructuring is expected to significantly reduce operating costs as a result of consolidating facilities and the lower thailand cost structure 
a change in estimate was made in the fourth quarter to reduce employee termination benefits by million and increase facility abandonment charges by million 
this was the result of higher turnover than projected and higher than expected costs to dispose of the mexican facility 
a  reduction in estimated restructuring charges was recorded in the third quarter primarily related to the lead wire product line disposition 
restructuring charges for fiscal included a million charge related to the discontinuation of the lead wire assembly product line and charges of million related to the disposition of iconovex  innovex s software division 
interest income expense 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal corresponds to the reduction in the company s excess cash as a result of the adflex acquisition and the high level of capital expenditures in fiscal interest expense increased to  in  from  in and  in interest expense increased substantially in fiscal related to the new million credit facility put in place related to the adflex acquisition 
other income expense 
net other expense for fiscal included a  charge related to the settlement of threatened litigation by a former director of the company 
income loss before provision for income taxes 
income loss before provision for income taxes was  for fiscal as compared to  for and  for as a percent of net sales  income before provision for income taxes was for as compared to and for and liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments decreased by  to  at september  net cash provided by operating activities decreased in to  from  in and  in the reduction in cash and short term investments and in net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to charges to restructure the company s manufacturing operations  temporary increases in inventory as a result of the move from mexico to thailand  operating losses generated by the acquired adflex operation and increased interest expense 
the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures in both fiscal and these capital expenditures in both fiscal and include additional equipment to increase the capacity of the automated flexible circuit production facility in litchfield  minnesota and the costs to construct and equip a material manufacturing facility 
in addition  fiscal included capital expenditures to increase the capacity of the lamphun thailand facility as part of the manufacturing restructuring plan to close the mexican facility and move the operation to thailand 
the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to cash flows from operations 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures included a portion of the costs to construct and equip an automated flexible circuit production facility 
this facility was constructed to meet the expected demand for high volume applications including the hif  fsa and semiconductor packaging related products 
the company also acquired the assets and operations of its thailand subcontractor in october for  on september   the company entered into a new credit facility arranged by norwest bank minnesota na which includes na bank na as an additional lender 
the facility was put in place to pay off all outstanding balances existing at the time of the adflex acquisition under the credit agreement among adflex  bankboston na and bank boston na as agent for lenders  as amended  as required by the adflex merger agreement 
the new credit facility consists of a million  five year revolving line of credit and a million  five year term loan with equal principal payments due each quarter commencing on october  and continuing through the september  maturity date 
at september   million was outstanding under the term loan and million was outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
working capital decreased by  to  at september  the company s current ratio was to at fiscal year end  compared to to at the end of fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the reduced level of cash and short term investments and the increase in current maturities of long term debt 
net property  plant and equipment increased by million to  at september  the increase was due to capital expenditures related to increasing the capacity of the automated flexible circuit production facility in litchfield  minnesota  capital expenditures to expand the lamphun thailand facility capacity and a portion of the costs to construct and equip a new material manufacturing facility in maple plain  minnesota offset by assets disposed of as part of the manufacturing restructuring including the closing of the agua prieta mexico facility 
intangible assets increased million to million at september  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the company s thailand subcontractor 
long term debt  net of current maturities  decreased by million as a portion of the credit facility entered into in as a result of the adflex acquisition is payable in fiscal and was transferred to current maturities of long term debt 
the ratio of long term debt to stockholders equity was 
at september  compared to 
at the end of fiscal management has entered into negotiations for obtaining additional credit facilities that would be secured by the receivables  inventory and assets held by the company in thailand 
management believes the establishment of a credit facility secured by thailand assets  existing credit facilities  cash and investments and cash generated from operations will provide an adequate source of funds to support projected working capital and capital expenditures in fiscal forward looking information statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in the annual report  in the company s form k and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company transacts business predominately in us dollars and a majority of its net sales are collected in us dollars  a material portion of its sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect the company s cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts hedges in the regular course of business to manage its risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
the gains or losses on hedges of transaction exposure are included in income in the period in which the exchange rates change 
the gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company periodically reviews the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short  balanced for those currencies in which the company has significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   the company had three open forward exchange contracts to sell thai baht for a total of  thai baht 
no assurance can be given that the company s hedging strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
