item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general candlewood operates  franchises  manages  and develops candlewood hotels serving mid market transient and extended stay business travelers 
the following table sets forth our property portfolio as of december  and number of hotels number of rooms december december increase increase owned    leased   managed joint venture franchised 
  total    our results of operations are dependent upon our revenue per available room revpar which is a factor of occupancy and room rate 
accordingly  we intend to remain focused on occupancy levels at each of our hotels until such time as the occupancy levels reach stabilization 
due to our rapid expansion  the overall occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
this negative impact on occupancy is expected to diminish as the ratio of new property openings during a period to total properties in operation at the end of the period decreases 
once our hotels occupancy levels have stabilized  we intend to review the daily pricing rates of our hotels 
we believe that this practice is a prevailing standard in the us lodging industry 
our overall results of operations and financial position are significantly influenced by our development activity 
the following table sets forth our hotel development for the past three years number of hotels december  open hotels owned leased managed joint venture franchised total under construction owned leased managed joint venture franchised total potential development owned leased managed joint venture franchised total managed hotels for the years  and represent hotels the company managed but which are not part of the candlewood system 
the following is a summary of hotel development by quarter for number of hotels first second third fourth as of quarter quarter quarter quarter as of owned leased managed joint venture franchised total at the end of  we had a total of company operated hotels hotels owned and leased and franchised hotels located in different states 
in addition  at december   we had a total of two company owned hotels  six joint venture hotels and five franchise hotels under construction 
our portfolio also included one parcel of undeveloped property 
we are attempting to secure financing for the development of this property 
if we are unable to secure financing for development of this property  we may sell the property in which case we may incur a loss on the sale 
as of december   we had two new joint venture development sites under contract on which we were performing market feasibility due diligence 
the contracts into which we enter for the purchase of potential hotel sites provide for numerous investigations and other due diligence  including environmental studies and title reports  prior to the closing of the sale 
we have the right to terminate each contract if we are not satisfied with the results of the investigations and due diligence 
we intend to continue developing additional hotels through either new construction or acquisition of existing properties and are evaluating various financing arrangements 
we expect to develop fewer hotels in than we did in we are unable to assure such development opportunities or the related financing will be available and  if available  under terms acceptable to us 
in addition  if we abandon a contract  we may write off certain costs that would have otherwise been capitalized 
for the years ended december  and  we wrote off million and million  respectively  of costs on development projects we abandoned 
we believe that a significant element of our future growth and expansion will be provided through the franchising of hotels 
during  we assembled an experienced franchise sales team to lead our efforts in this area 
as of december   all franchise activity reported represents the franchising of the candlewood suites brand 
the following table summarizes the franchise development activity for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  applications received applications approved franchise agreements signed we received franchise applications during and signed new franchise agreements 
based on the projected construction dates  the majority of these hotels are scheduled to open in we are unable to assure that we will enter into any additional franchise agreements or that franchisees will complete the development and construction of hotels 
traditionally  our franchise development program has consisted of one brand  candlewood suites 
to serve a perceived market demand  we added a second brand  cambridge suites by candlewood  to our franchise program in november we believe the addition of the cambridge suites brand diversifies our franchise program and provides additional growth opportunities 
in two separate sale leaseback transactions  we have sold and leased back certain of our hotels with hpt  a real estate investment trust 
the provisions of the transactions allow us to operate  as lessee  over a defined lease term  hotels that we developed 
the transactions were closed in stages  beginning in and ending in early five hotels were sold and leased back in and hotels sold and leased back during the remaining three hotels were sold and leased back in january the results from operations for  and reflect the transactions 
as a result of the sale leaseback transactions  we have recorded rent expense on the hotels leased back from hpt 
as the hotels are leased and not owned  the financial statements do not reflect any depreciation and amortization or interest expense for these hotels after the date of sale 
the proceeds from the sale of the hotels is recorded net of the deferred gain on sale 
the gain is deferred and not recognized into earnings until certain operating performance levels are achieved 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in june  we entered into an agreement with boston capital institutional advisors llc and mass mutual to jointly develop to new candlewood hotels 
as of december  we had six joint venture hotels under construction pursuant to this agreement  all of which are scheduled to open in in addition  at december   we had identified two additional potential joint venture development sites 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  hotel operations hotel operations revenue the following is a summary of and hotel operations revenues  stratified by the year in which the hotels opened in thousands fiscal year number fiscal fiscal increase percentage opened of hotels revenues revenues decrease change   n a total    hotel operations revenue  which includes room revenue and other revenue eg guest telephone  sales of products from the candlewood cupboard  was million for  compared to million for the increase in revenue reflects the increase in the number of hotels in operation during and the full year impact of the hotels opened in fifteen of the hotels opened in opened in the fourth quarter 
the following table sets forth our operating statistics for and for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room average occupancy rate  which is determined by dividing the number of guest rooms occupied by the total number of guest rooms available for the period  was for  compared to for the occupancy rate during was positively influenced by the increase in occupancy experienced by those hotels that had completed or were near completion of their ramp up phase 
the overall increase in the occupancy rate was partially offset by a decrease in occupancy which occurred as a result of the increase in room rates at some of our more established hotels 
it is our practice to continuously review individual markets to assess the impact of competition on local supply and demand and to attempt to establish room rates that balance occupancy to produce optimal revenue 
the average daily room rate in was  compared to for average daily room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied for the applicable period 
the increase in average daily rate was largely due to increases in room rates charged at previously opened hotels and higher introductory rates for new hotel openings 
other factors that influenced average daily room rates included o stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  o higher rates for our one bedroom suites  and o higher rates in certain hotel locations 
revenue per available room  calculated as the average occupancy rate multiplied by the average daily rate  was for  compared to for  a increase 
the increase was due to increases in the average daily occupancy rate and the average daily room rate 
we cannot predict whether current occupancy and room rates can be maintained 
future occupancy and room rates may be impacted by a number of factors including o the number and geographic location of new hotels  o the season in which new hotels open  o competition  o market acceptance of our hotels  and o general economic conditions 
we consider a property to have completed its initial ramp up phase somewhere between six and twelve months following hotel opening 
the ramp up phase is dependent on the supply demand characteristics of individual markets as well as the effectiveness of our local sales efforts 
we had company operated hotels open as of december   of which opened in the following table sets forth the performance of our hotels  stratified by the year in which the hotels opened number of average daily revenue per hotels occupancy rate available room hotels hotels hotels hotels total hotels we had company operated hotels open at december  the following table sets forth the performance of these hotels for the years ending december  and  respectively for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room the average occupancy rate for the hotels open as of december  declined occupancy points in to  compared to for this decline was due in large part to our efforts in to increase room rates and geographic market performance 
many of the hotels are located in the midwest 
these markets are secondary markets and typically have lower barriers to entry 
the average daily room rate in increased over despite the decline in occupancy rates  revenue per available room increased for the hotels in  compared to hotel operating expenses hotel operating expenses in totaled million  compared to million for hotel operating expenses consist of all expenses directly applicable to the operation of the hotels 
the largest portion of hotel operating expenses consisted of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of hotel operating expenses was comprised of normal operating items  such as utilities  property taxes  insurance  supplies  promotional materials  maintenance items and similar expenses 
the increase in hotel operating expenses is largely due to the full year impact of the hotels opened in and the increase in the number of hotels in operation during rent expense on leased hotels we incurred rent expense in of million for the hotels leased as of december  we recorded million of rent expense in for the hotels leased as of december  the increase in rent expense reflects the full year lease costs of the hotels sold and leased back in and the three additional hotels sold and leased back in january hotel opening costs opening costs are costs incurred prior to the opening of a hotel and include costs related to the hiring and training of hotel personnel  such as travel  compensation and relocation 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected early adoption of statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires opening costs to be expensed as incurred 
prior to adoption of sop  we capitalized and amortized opening costs using the straight line method over a period of twelve months 
amortization expense on opening costs for is included in depreciation and amortization on the statement of operations 
opening costs for totaled million 
there were no opening cost expensed in  however  we did record million of amortization expense in for opening costs that had been capitalized

the total amount expensed in due to the change in accounting principle was million 
hotel depreciation and amortization hotel depreciation and amortization expense eg building  furniture  fixtures  equipment for  totaled million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of company owned hotels open and operating during and the full year impact of the hotels opened in many of our hotels opened in the second to fourth quarters of and as a result  only a partial year s depreciation was recorded in for both and  depreciation and amortization expense does not reflect any expense for the properties sold in the sale leaseback transactions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we do not depreciate assets held for sale 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from three to forty years 
corporate operations other income other income for totaled million  compared to  for other income consists primarily of franchise fees and royalty fees from franchise hotels  management fees received from two managed hotels cambridge suites and the hotel at old town  both located in wichita  kansas and equity income from a joint venture hotel in rockford  illinois 
at december   we had franchised hotels in operation  compared to nine hotels at december  the increase in other income in  compared to reflects an increase in royalty  franchise fee and management fee income  partially offset by our equity in the net loss of the rockford  illinois joint venture hotel 
royalty income in increased primarily due to the full year impact of the six franchise hotels that opened in franchise fee income in increased as a direct result of our increased franchise sales efforts 
in addition  we sold three additional hotels as part of the sale leaseback transaction during the total sales price for these hotels was million 
a deferred gain of million was recorded on the sales

the largest portion of corporate operating expenses consisted of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of other corporate operating expenses was comprised of normal operating costs  such as office space lease  travel  utilities  advertising  professional fees and similar expenses 
the increase in reflects the expansion of our franchise sales and services team and increases in general personnel and field information system support costs 
these increases were needed to launch our franchise sales program and to provide support and services to the increased number of hotels in operation 
abandoned site costs we recorded million of abandoned site costs in  compared to million in abandoned site costs represent costs related to certain development sites that we have decided not to develop 
corporate depreciation and amortization corporate depreciation and amortization applicable to corporate operations for totaled  compared to  for the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization reflects the leasehold improvements and furnishings purchased in for new corporate offices and the depreciation of new systems hardware and peripheral equipment

the principal payments on notes payable made in related primarily to the hotels sold in at december   we had two company owned hotels under construction with a total estimated cost of approximately million 
we have secured financing on both hotels 
as of december   we had incurred costs of approximately million on these projects 
under terms of the financing  our total equity requirement for these properties is million  million of which had been funded as of december  the remaining million of equity will be funded upon completion of the hotel 
in addition to the company owned hotels under construction  at december   we owned one property on which construction had not begun 
we are attempting to secure financing for this project 
we had six hotels under construction at december  as part of our joint venture development agreement with boston capital institutional advisors and mass mutual 
the total estimated cost of construction for these six hotels is million 
as of december   the joint venture had incurred costs of approximately million on these projects 
these costs include land acquisition costs  deposits and fees for surveys  legal services  environmental studies  and architectural drawings 
our total equity requirement per the loan agreements for these six hotels is million  all of which had been funded as of december  in addition  we have two joint venture properties under contract at december  with an estimated total project cost of million 
under the terms of our joint venture development agreement  if we do not have at least hotels under construction by august   we may be required to increase our capital contributions relating to existing and future joint venture hotels 
we have not secured financing for this contingency 
we will continue to identify and evaluate potential joint venture sites 
we believe that a combination of our cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  borrowed funds from third party lenders if approved on an individual basis and construction loan guarantees from doubletree will be sufficient to provide capital for development of projects currently under construction  payment of preferred dividends and operations through december in addition  from time to time we will consider strategic acquisitions as a means of growth  which would similarly require additional capital 
we are actively considering and or pursuing a number of financing alternatives  including credit facilities  the issuance of equity  debt or equity linked securities and joint ventures which are necessary to provide the capital needed to build or acquire additional hotels 
we are unable to assure that we will be able to obtain financing on a timely basis  on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  losses of deposits or other committed capital  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
dividend payments on the series a and series b preferred stock are paid quarterly and in preference to the common stock 
these payments are approximately million per quarter 
after payment of dividends on the series a and series b preferred stock  we intend to retain any future earnings for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business 
impact of the year issue in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of our systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe our systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expended approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as the majority of our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on prime and libor 
if interest rates change by 
percent  the market value of our mortgages and notes payable  based on the outstanding balance at december   would change by approximately  additionally  we have market risk on our short term investments  which are considered cash equivalents  due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase by
