see liquidity and capital resources 
year the year or yk problem stems from the fact that many computer systems use only two digits when they refer to a year 
it was widely believed that when the calendar rolled to at the end of those computers and systems that were not updated to handle a four digit year would begin to perform calculations where the in would be interpreted as during and the company aggressively researched and tested potential yk problems within its software and systems 
as a result of this research and testing and the company s desire to improve its overall information technology  the company purchased several computer systems and upgraded several other systems 
the majority of this work was performed by outside consultants and therefore represented capital expenditures 
the company is not aware of any computer system on which it relies that was impacted by the yk problem subsequent to year end 
additionally the company has not been impacted by any yk related problems experienced by any of the company s suppliers or vendors 
the company will continue to monitor its computer systems  and those of suppliers and vendors providing services to the company throughout for any yk related problems 
through the year ended december  the company has not incurred significant costs directly associated with yk evaluations and corrections 
the company does not expect to incur significant costs moving forward to rectify any yk issues

commissions increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this overall increase was primarily attributable to an increase in route revenue  since commissions are generally paid based upon a percentage of revenue earned in the company s route locations 
as a percentage of route revenue  commissions increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  these fluctuations are caused by different commission rates on new contracts  accounts acquired and also in part on the impact of the reprographics division s commission rate structure

general  administration  sales and marketing expenses increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this overall increase was primarily attributable to changes associated with the combining of the sales and marketing efforts of the two non laundry acquisitions with the laundry division  as well as consulting and legal expenses related to business expansion opportunities 
impairment of goodwill 
since the acquisition of copico  inc  the reprographics division has not met expectations with respect to its profitability and has produced operating losses 
the company acquired copico  inc in april for approximately  in cash and  shares of mac gray common stock  less the assumption of certain liabilities 
in accordance with the purchase method of accounting the purchase price was assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with any excess purchase price being allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
the goodwill and intangibles recorded in connection with the transaction were approximately the most significant reason for the poor performance of the division has been the impact of technological advances in the past year which have affected the entire reprographics industry 
specifically  the introduction of the internet in college and public libraries  and access to free laser printers have led to fewer vended copies being made than in prior years 
in april  the company began to take corrective action to address certain operational difficulties the division was encountering and to evaluate the entire impact the availability of the internet in college and public libraries was having on the division 
the company replaced the senior management of this division and corrected other organizational and operational inefficiencies which had been negatively impacting the performance of this division 
the company continued to monitor the performance of the division for the remainder of  and due to the lack of satisfactory improvement and the continued insurgence of the internet into its customer base the company performed a full scale reevaluation of the division and its long term prospects in the fourth quarter of the result of this evaluation was the confirmation of longer term expectations of lower operating results 
accordingly  management recognized a non cash  non recurring impairment charge of  or 
per share  in the fourth quarter of this charge was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from year ended december  this increase is primarily related to a full year of the outstanding borrowings related to the significant acquisition activity during  capital expenditures associated with internal growth  acquisition of capital stock and higher interest rates associated with the company s outstanding loan balances

additionally  goodwill recorded in connection with certain business acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective tax rate in results from the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets which are permanently non deductible items 
the results of operations for the year ended december  include a tax benefit of due to the release of a valuation allowance on certain tax assets available for use by intirion 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  due to the differing year ends of mac gray and intirion prior to the combination  the year ended december  represents consolidated results for the period from january through december for mac gray consolidated with the results for the period from july through june for intirion

commissions increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from year ended december  this overall increase was primarily attributable to an increase in route revenue  since commissions are generally paid based upon a percentage of revenue earned in the company s route locations 
the slower rate of increase relative to route revenue was attributable to average commission rates on accounts acquired through acquisition during being lower than on accounts which existed in route expenditures 
route expenditures include costs associated with installing and servicing machines  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
route expenditures increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase was due  in part  to the general increase in revenue  which resulted in increased servicing  collecting  counting and depositing activity  and to the addition of branch locations as a result of acquisitions 
the increase was also attributable to acquisitions made during for which the fixed and variable cost mix associated with route expenditures is different and causes increases in route expenditures relative to route revenue to rise during the slower periods of the year  including june through august 
depreciation and amortization

seasonality the company experiences moderate seasonality as a result of its significant operations in the college and university market 
revenues derived from the college and university market represent approximately twenty five percent of the company s total revenue 
route and rental revenues are derived substantially during the school year that includes the first  second and fourth calendar quarters 
conversely  the company increases its operating expenditures during the third calendar quarter  when colleges and universities are not in session  as a result of mac gray s increased product installation activities 
product sales  principally microfridge  to this market are also high during the third calendar quarter 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands mac gray s primary sources of cash since december  have been operating activities and bank borrowings 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchase of new laundry machines  microfridge equipment  reprographics equipment and smart card based payment systems 
the company also used funds available to repurchase shares of common stock  and for laundry business acquisitions 
the company anticipates that it will continue to use cash flow from its operating activities to finance working capital needs  including interest payments on any outstanding indebtedness  as well as capital expenditures 
to help mitigate the effect of possible higher interest rates in the future  on february   the company negotiated interest rate swaps which fixed  of loan interest rate for years and  of loan interest rate for years 
cash flows provided by operations were   and  for years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations consists primarily of route revenue  product sales  laundry equipment service revenue  and rental revenue  offset by commissions  route expenditures  cost of product sales  cost of rental revenue  general and administration expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
the increase from to is primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization which is a non cash expense 
cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
mac gray invested approximately  in connection with acquisitions  compared to  and  for acquisitions in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities for those periods consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank borrowings  and capital stock transactions 
the decrease in is principally a result of fewer business acquisitions than in as well as borrowing used to fund the repurchase of common stock and capital expenditures 
the company s current loan agreement provides for maximum borrowing of  as of december  the available balance was  although the company expects to fund its operations  debt service obligations  internal growth  and acquisitions through cash generated from operations and the available loan balance  it may be necessary to postpone some capital spending or acquisitions until adequate cash is generated from operations or a new credit facility is obtained 
in april  the company s current loan agreement converts to a term loan  payable over two years 
the company was in compliance with  or had received waivers for non compliance with  the terms of the credit agreement as of december  inflation the company does not believe that its financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
forward looking statements some of the statements incorporated by reference or made in this report under the captions risk factors  business  and management discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this report or in documents incorporated by reference are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of when the company uses the words anticipate  assume  believe  estimate  expect  intend  and other similar expressions in this report  it is generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
investors should not rely on forward looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which are  in some cases  beyond the company s control and which could materially affect actual results  performance or achievements 
factors that could cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors described under risk factors in this report 
investors should carefully review all of the factors described below  which may not be an exhaustive list of these factors 
risk factors a purchase of mac gray common stock involves various risks 
investors should consider the following risk factors the company s cash flows may not be sufficient to finance the significant capital expenditures required to replace equipment and implement new technology 
the company must continue to make capital expenditures in order to replace existing equipment  which requires significant financing 
in addition  the company s plan to use smart card based technologies will also require significant capital expenditures 
while it is anticipated that existing capital resources  as well as cash from operations  will be adequate to finance anticipated capital expenditures  the company cannot assure the investor that the company s resources or cash flows will be sufficient 
to the extent that available resources are insufficient to fund capital requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or curtail certain capital expenditures 
such financings may not be available or available only on less favorable terms and  in the case of equity financings  could result in dilution to stockholders 
indebtedness may limit the company s use of cash flow and restrict its flexibility 
in the event the company is unable to decrease the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility  the indebtedness could 
require use of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on indebtedness  leaving less cash flow available for other purposes  
materially limit or impair the company s ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  general corporate or other purposes  and 
reduce flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
the credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial and other operating covenants 
failure to comply with any of these covenants  which the lender does not waive  would permit the lender to accelerate the loan 
an acceleration of the loan could have a material adverse effect on business 
operations could be disrupted if the company were unable to renew its laundry leases 
the business is highly dependent upon the renewal of leases with property owners  colleges and universities and public housing authorities 
these leases have an average length of seven to ten years with approximately to renewable each year 
mac gray has traditionally relied upon exclusive  long term leases with its customers  as well as frequent customer interaction and a historical emphasis on customer service  to assure continuity of financial and operating results 
the company cannot assure investors that 
it will be able to continue to secure long term exclusive leases with customers on favorable terms  
it will be able to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  or 
it will not experience a loss of business if property owners or management companies choose to vacate properties as a result of economic downturns that impact occupancy levels 
failure by the company to continue to obtain long term exclusive leases with a substantial number of its customers  or to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  could have a material adverse effect on business 
competition on local and national levels may hinder the company s ability to expand 
the card and coin operated laundry services industry is highly competitive  both locally and nationally 
on the local level  private businesses tend to have long standing relationships with property owners and managers in their specific geographic market 
on the national level  there are two competitors which have significantly larger installed machine bases than mac gray 
these larger companies tend to have significant operational and managerial resources to devote to expansion and to capture additional market share 
these competitive forces may increase purchase prices for future acquisitions to levels that make the acquisitions less attractive or uneconomical 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that it will be able to compete effectively in any specific geographic location in the business of supplying laundry equipment services to property owners and managers or in the acquisition of other businesses 
the company s ability to make acquisitions depends upon its ability to access capital on acceptable terms 
partial success of the company s growth strategy is dependent upon its ability to identify  finance and consummate acquisitions on acceptable financial terms 
the access to capital is subject to the following risks 
use of common stock as acquisition consideration may result in dilution to stockholders  
if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient valuation or if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept shares of the company s common stock  then the company will be required to use more cash resources or other consideration to make acquisitions  
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash for acquisitions from existing operations  its ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected unless it is able to obtain additional capital through external financings or to borrow sufficient amounts  and 
funding the acquisition program through debt financing will result in additional leverage 
growth strategy may not be successful if the company is unable to acquire and integrate new businesses 
the company s growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate and operate additional businesses 
while the company generally believes that the management team and business structure currently in place enables it to operate a significantly larger and more diverse operation  it may be exposed to the following risks in connection with finding  completing  and successfully integrating acquisitions 
the inability to effectively and efficiently integrate the assets of the acquired businesses  
the inability to increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business  
the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of money and time integrating acquired businesses  particularly operations located in new regions and operations involving new lines of business  and 
future acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting may result in the recording of goodwill and intangibles  the amortization of which may reduce net income 
operations could be disrupted if the company is unable to continue its relationships with maytag and other suppliers 
currently the company purchases a majority of the equipment that is used in the laundry route business from maytag corporation 
in addition  the company derives a significant amount of non laundry route revenue  as well as competitive advantages  from its position as a distributor of maytag commercial laundry products 
although the agreements between the company and maytag corporation may be terminated by either party upon written notice  maytag corporation has never terminated any of the agreements 
the company also currently purchases substantially all of its smart card based equipment from schlumberger technologies  inc  a manufacturer of card based electronic transaction systems 
in addition  the company currently procures a substantial amount of the products used by the microfridge division from a limited number of suppliers  including sanyo e e corporation 
if any of these suppliers terminated or demanded a substantial revision of the contracts or business relationships currently in place  there may be a delay in finding a replacement  and an inability to find terms as favorable as the current terms 
the microfridge products may be susceptible to product liability claims for which insurance may not be adequate 
through intirion  the company markets and distributes microfridge  a combination microwave and refrigerator 
the sale and distribution of microfridge  as well as other products  entails a risk of product liability claims 
further  although microfridge is manufactured by third parties under contract with intirion  intirion may be subject to risks of product liability claims related to this manufacture 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to renew its existing insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that presently in effect  if at all 
in the event that intirion is held liable for a claim against which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of insurance coverage  the claim could have a material adverse effect on business 
reliance upon common law and contractual intellectual property rights may be insufficient to protect the company from adverse claims 
the company relies upon certain trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non solicitation agreements and other methods to protect proprietary rights 
periodically the company makes filings with the patent and trademark office to protect some of the proprietary rights  although the company has traditionally relied upon the protections afforded by contract rights and through common law ownership rights 
the company cannot assure investors that these contract rights and legal claims to ownership will adequately protect the operations from adverse claims 
in addition  any adverse claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of the business 
principal stockholders  directors and executive officers could exercise control and prevent a sale or merger 
as of march   mac gray s principal stockholders  directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this percentage ownership does not include options to purchase  shares of common stock held by some of these persons   of which are currently exercisable 
if these affiliates exercised any of their options  then the ownership of common stock would be further concentrated 
as a result of this concentration in ownership  these stockholders  if they were to act together  could have the ability  as a practical matter  to significantly influence the outcome of the election of directors and all other matters requiring approval by a majority of stockholders 
matters requiring stockholder approval include significant corporate transactions  such as mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the concentration of ownership in affiliates  together  in some cases  with specific provisions of charter and bylaws  as described below  and applicable sections of the corporate law of delaware  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of mac gray 
a discussion of this anti takeover effect appears below 
provisions of the company s charter  bylaws  delaware law  and the shareholders rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging takeovers 
specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  sections of the corporate law of delaware and powers of the board of directors may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors  including takeovers which some stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders  even if the particular removal or assumption of control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors also could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if these events would be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of stockholders 
the anti takeover provisions and powers of the board of directors include  among other things 
ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights  preferences and other terms of such preferred stock  
a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  
the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent  
the absence of cumulative voting for directors  
the removal of directors only for cause  
the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors and  subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock  if issued  to fill vacancies thereon  
the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors  except as otherwise required by law  to call special meetings of stockholders  
advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors  and 
ownership restrictions  under the corporate law of delaware  with limited exceptions  upon acquirors including their affiliates and associates of or more of our common stock 

the company s entry into a shareholder rights agreement providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of the common shares unless the rights are redeemed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates on its borrowings
