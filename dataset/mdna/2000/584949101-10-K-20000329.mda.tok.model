item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national provider of medical transcription services 
substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from the provision of medical transcription services  which we recognize when we render services and deliver reports 
we also derive an insignificant amount of revenue from services other than traditional transcription services  such as coding revenue  interfacing fees  equipment rentals  referral fees and commissions from strategic partners 
fees for medical transcription services are based primarily on contracted rates and revenue is recognized upon the rendering of services and delivery of transcribed reports 
revenues from other sources are recognized when earned 
for purposes of our discussion and analysis of our results of operations we distinguish our revenue growth as core growth and growth from large acquisitions 
core growth includes revenue from all of the above sources and revenue from acquisitions with annual sales under million  prior to the date of acquisition 
revenue arising from acquisitions having annual revenue in excess of million  prior to the date of acquisition  is discussed separately in our analysis of revenue growth 
cost of revenue consists of all direct costs associated with providing transcription related services  including payroll  telecommunications  repairs and maintenance  rent and other direct costs 
most of our cost of revenue is variable in nature  but includes certain fixed components 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our senior executive management  marketing  accounting  legal and other administrative functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses are mostly fixed in nature  but include certain variable components 
from through  we completed acquisitions 
six acquisitions  including the acquisition of mrc  were accounted for as pooling of interests 
four of these acquisitions were material and  accordingly  we restated our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of revenue  as restated for our acquisitions accounted for as a pooling of interests year ended december  revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative depreciation amortization of intangible assets transaction costs and restructuring charges operating income gain on sale of securities interest income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue

we have a borrowing facility with chase manhattan bank 
the chase facility provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility expiring april  the chase facility bears interest at resetting rates selected by the company from various alternatives 
the interest rate alternatives are either the greater of a prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c the bank s certificate of deposit rate plus  or libor plus 
the chase facility also allows us to finance up to of any acquisitions of companies that are in the business of providing transcriptions related services 
the financing of these acquisitions may be carved out of the chase facility and amortized over five year periods consecutive quarters 
each acquisition term loan that is created would permanently reduce the remaining chase facility commitment by a like amount 
we can use the chase facility for working capital and general corporate purposes 
if any amounts under the chase facility are repaid  other than acquisition term loans  we may reborrow such amounts 
the chase facility includes financial and other covenants applicable to us  including limitations on capital expenditures and dividends 
during we had no outstanding borrowings under the chase facility 
we believe that cash flow generated from operations and our borrowing capacity whether under the chase facility  or otherwise  will be sufficient to meet our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
in  we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to be consistent with prior years 
year compliance to date  we have not experienced any material year issues 
we have not spent a material amount of funds on year issues  and currently believe all systems are year compliant 
we will continue to monitor for any year problems 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we generally do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we make investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio
