item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and includes promis systems inc promis  acquired in fiscal year  and the equipe combined companies equipe  acquired in fiscal year  each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain income and expense items as a percentage of net revenue net revenue product and equipment services and maintenance total net revenue cost of revenue product and equipment services and maintenance total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development merger costs and special charges operating loss other income  net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss fiscal vs 
fiscal total net revenue total net revenue for fiscal year increased to  compared to  for fiscal year this overall increase in the company s total net revenue is attributable to an increase in the company s market share and the upturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry  which resulted in an increase in the construction and expansion of semiconductor fabs 
total net revenue increased in the three operating segments  factory systems  oem systems  and software systems   and  respectively  in fiscal year total product and equipment revenue increased in fiscal year in addition  service and maintenance revenue increased  for a net change in total revenue of 
net export sales to customers outside of north america were  or of revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company incurred late delivery penalties that adversely impacted revenue by  on september   the company announced that its factory systems segment had encountered manufacturing and supply chain problems relating to its new turbostocker product  which had been scheduled to transition into high volume production during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of these problems  the company announced that its revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year would be lower than expected  including the effect of of late delivery penalties 
the company has initiated efforts to correct the manufacturing and supply chain problems in its factory systems segment 
these problems will continue to affect the company s revenue and profitability in the first half of fiscal  and if the company is unable to correct these problems in a timely manner  the adverse impact could be more prolonged 
see certain factors that may affect future results 
gross profit the company s gross profit margin was for fiscal year  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit margin occurred principally in the factory systems segment  as a result of lower than expected revenues and increased costs related to the company s turbostocker manufacturing problems 
these problems and the corresponding corrective actions resulted in specific charges being incurred in the fourth quarter relating mainly to inventory provisions and write downs of  provisions for contract losses of  and provisions for warranty expense and other items of  the decrease was offset partially by gross profit margin improvements in the company s oem systems segment due to greater manufacturing efficiencies associated with increased production volumes and by a favorable change in product mix toward the company s higher margin oem systems products 
service and maintenance gross profit margin was for fiscal year  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in service and maintenance gross profit margin relates primarily to increases in personnel and related costs to support anticipated future growth of the company s installed base of products 
research and development research and development expenses increased to  or approximately of total net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in fiscal year spending is the result of the company s continued investments in next generation automation system products  including interfloor transport systems  automated storage and retrieval systems  bare reticle stockers  robotic wafer handling systems  mes systems  and advanced planning and scheduling systems 
the decrease in spending as a percent of total net revenue  in fiscal year  is due to the increase in total net revenue during the fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  or of total net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  the company increased marketing efforts  sales activities and other administrative expenses incurred in support of the growth in customer orders and revenues 
the decrease in spending as a percent of total net revenue is due to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal year  as well as to the consolidation of duplicate functions and activities of acquired companies 
merger costs and special charges the company did not recognize any merger costs or special charges during fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded special charges of  representing provisions for severance compensation relating to the termination of personnel 
the personnel reductions included in manufacturing and customer support  in engineering and in sales  general and administrative functions 
in the second quarter of fiscal year the company acquired promis  in a pooling of interests transaction  and recorded merger costs of  consisting primarily of investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
in addition  the company recorded special charges of  during the second quarter  of fiscal year  consisting of  for compensation related costs for five management personnel in sales  general and administrative functions to satisfy existing contractual obligations related to acquired companies   of costs associated with the reduction of leased facilities  and  for other legal costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized a credit of  to adjust the estimated costs to reflect actual costs 
at september   approximately  of these charges remain in accrued expenses  and are expected to be paid during fiscal year other income  net other income  net  in fiscal year was  or of total net revenue  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
interest income was  and  and interest expense was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was due to the higher average cash balance on hand during fiscal year net translation and foreign exchange loss of  was recorded in fiscal year compared to net translation and foreign exchange gain of  in fiscal year provision for income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal year was  compared to  for the previous fiscal year 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was as compared to for the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the provision for foreign and local taxes 
fiscal vs 
fiscal total net revenue total net revenue for fiscal year decreased to  compared to  for fiscal year this overall decrease in the company s total net revenue was attributable to the downturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry  which resulted in a significant slowdown in the construction or expansion of semiconductor fabs 
the total net revenue decline occurred primarily in the factory systems and oem systems segments  which declined by and in fiscal year  respectively 
while product and equipment revenue decreased  the company gained market share in fiscal year and experienced a increase in its service and maintenance revenue 
net export sales to customers outside of north america were  or of revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit the company s gross profit margin was for fiscal year  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  there were  in charges to cost of sales related to inventory and warranty provisions 
excluding these charges  fiscal year gross profit margins would have been 
the decline in gross profit margin in fiscal year occurred principally in the factory systems segment  which decreased  to from 
the deterioration in margin was the result of fixed capacity and related manufacturing costs  which could not be reduced proportionally with the reduction in production volume  and a decline in product pricing during the industry downturn 
this decline was partially offset by favorable changes in product mix 
gross margin for service and maintenance increased in fiscal year to from in fiscal year and was primarily related to increased growth in software maintenance contracts 
research and development research and development expenses increased slightly to  or approximately of total net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the dollar amount of research and development spending reflects the company s continued investment in new product development and enhancements of existing product lines 
the company continued to invest in the development of mm and mm products throughout its factory automation and tool automation product lines as well as the manufacturing execution  and advanced planning and scheduling software product lines 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of total net revenue for fiscal year  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the company reduced its expenses in the current fiscal year in response to the industry downturn and through the consolidation of common activities and functions of acquired companies 
in fiscal year  the company reduced its work force by personnel  including in sales  general and administrative functions  in addition to a reduction in force of personnel  including in sales  general and administrative functions  in fiscal year see merger costs and special charges for discussion of severance and reductions of leased facilities 
acquired in process research and development in fiscal year  the company recorded a charge of  in relation to the purchase of incomplete technology acquired in the ilc acquisition 
merger costs and special charges during fiscal year the company incurred certain special charges 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded special charges of  representing provisions for severance compensation relating to the termination of personnel 
the personnel reductions included in manufacturing and customer support  in engineering and in sales  general and administrative functions 
in the second fiscal quarter the company acquired promis  in a pooling of interest transaction  and recorded merger costs of  consisting primarily of investment banking  legal and accounting fees 
in addition  during the second quarter  the company recorded special charges of  the special charges consisted of  for compensation related costs for five management personnel in sales  general and administrative functions to satisfy existing contractual obligations related to acquired companies   of costs associated with the reduction of leased facilities  and  for other legal costs 
in the fourth fiscal quarter  the company recognized a credit of  to adjust the estimated costs to reflect actual costs 
at september    of these charges remained in accrued expenses 
during fiscal year the company incurred certain special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired equipe in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
direct acquisition costs  primarily related to legal  investment banking  and accounting fees  amounted to  and were charged against the results of operations in the quarter 
additionally  during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring and other special charges of  in response to market conditions and to integrate the equipe operations 
the special charges included provisions for severance compensation of  resulting from terminations of approximately personnel completed in fiscal year the personnel reductions consisted of in manufacturing and customer support  in engineering and in sales  general and administrative functions 
in addition  the special charges included costs of  relating to reductions of leased facilities space and a non cash write down of specialized demonstration equipment for a particular customer of  and other assets that are not usable elsewhere 
of the total  severance and lease reduction charges recorded in fiscal year  all of these special charges had been paid as of september  other income  net other income  net  in fiscal year was  or of total net revenue  compared to  or of total net revenue for the prior fiscal year 
interest income was  and  and interest expense was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
net translation and foreign exchange gains of  were recorded in fiscal year and net translation and foreign exchange losses of  were incurred in fiscal year provision for benefit from income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal year was  compared to a benefit of  for the previous fiscal year 
the effective tax rate in fiscal year was as compared to for the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal year  the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the provision for foreign taxes and the increase in the valuation allowance as a result of management s conclusion that a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset was required  under applicable accounting criteria 
the effect of the provision for foreign taxes and the increase in the valuation allowance was partially offset by the company s ability to carryback tax losses generated in fiscal year to a prior profitable period 
the fiscal year effective tax rate reflects the charges for acquired in process research and development and merger and other special charges which are not fully deductible for income tax purposes 
this unfavorable impact was partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of equipe technologies  inc and e machine  inc  which were both subchapter s corporations for federal income tax purposes for the three months ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations primarily through private equity financing  bank lines of credit  public stock offerings in october and july and cash generated from operations 
in addition  during fiscal year the company completed a common stock offering which provided the company with million of cash  net of offering expenses 
at september  the company had working capital of  including cash and cash equivalents of  compared to working capital of  including cash and cash equivalents of  as of september  net cash used in operations was  in fiscal year  compared to net cash used in operations of  in fiscal year the net cash used by operating activities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the net loss  increases in accounts receivable and contracts in progress in aggregate of  and increases in inventory of  these cash outflows were partially offset by the non cash expenses of  consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization and provisions for write downs of inventories as well as increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  net cash used in operations in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the net loss  partially offset by non cash items of  consisting of depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
additionally  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  decreases in accounts receivable of  and decreases in contracts in progress of  provided cash from operations 
the net cash used in operations and the investment in working capital is in support of the growth in customer orders  revenues and overall business operations 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the increase is principally attributable to investments in capital assets  primarily leasehold improvements and computers and telecommunications equipment 
the company anticipates that it will continue to invest in capital equipment to support its infrastructure needs accompanying its business growth 
subsequent to september   the company made a million minority investment in shinsung engineering co 
ltd  as part of a strategic alliance 
see note v of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal year  compared to cash provided in financing activities of  in fiscal year the increase is principally attributable to the company s common stock offering  completed during the third quarter  which provided  net of offering expenses 
the increase in fiscal year is also attributable to  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from the company s employee stock purchase plan 
at september   the company had a revolving credit facility agreement with chase manhattan bank the bank 
the revolving credit facility enables the company to borrow up to  on an unsecured basis 
outstanding revolving credit loans bear interest  at the company s option  at the  or day libor rate plus a credit spread  or at the effective prime rate 
at september   the libor borrowing rate would have been 
the ability of the company to borrow under the revolving credit facility is conditioned upon the meeting of certain financial criteria 
the revolving credit agreement expires on december  on december   the company amended its existing revolving credit facility agreement with the bank extending the expiration date to march  at september   the company had outstanding letters of credit with the bank of  and therefore  the available balance under this credit agreement was  at september   the company was not in compliance with the minimum consolidated net worth requirement  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and the maximum total funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ratio of the revolving credit agreement  but has subsequently received a waiver from the bank through september  the company expects to seek future waivers as necessary from the bank 
however  there can be no assurance that such waivers will be obtained 
the company believes that existing cash and investment balances and funds available under its existing revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are not historical facts but which are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to the company s expectations concerning its future results of operations and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  internal  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
many of these factors are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information or future events or otherwise 
important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to the factors discussed below 
the company s future results face the following risks and uncertainties the company has experienced and may continue to experience capacity constraints during high growth periods which may limit the company s ability to take advantage of business opportunities during such periods  such as the manufacturing problems related to its new turbostocker product that adversely affected the company s results of operations in fiscal year  during periods of high growth  the company is required to increase its cost structure to support anticipated customer services and such cost increases may occur before related revenue increases  the company maintains inventory to support production which  due to the evolution of products and the cyclical nature of demand  may be rendered obsolete  and in order to continually improve its technology to remain competitive  the company must expend substantial resources on research and development  even in periods during industry downturns 
in addition to the foregoing  the following additional factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price oversupply in the semiconductor market may in the future reduce demand for capital equipment  including for the company s systems 
the company s business depends heavily upon capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers  particularly manufacturers that are opening or expanding semiconductor fabrication facilities 
these manufacturers frequently postpone or abandon their plans to make capital expenditures when demand for their products and products containing semiconductors is low 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical  and periods of oversupply in the market for semiconductors have caused significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including the company s systems 
the company believes that this cyclicality will continue and that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors will be subject to similar fluctuations 
also  the recent high rate of technical innovation and resulting improvements in the performance and price of semiconductor devices  which have driven much of the demand for the company s products  could slow  or encounter limits  in the future 
in addition  any other factor adversely affecting the semiconductor industry or particular segments within the semiconductor industry may adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the semiconductor industry recently experienced a downturn that adversely affected the company s operating results  and reduced demand for semiconductors in the future could jeopardize the company s plans 
in recent years  the semiconductor industry experienced a significant downturn  which seriously harmed the company s ability to sell its systems 
the recent downturn in the asia pacific market also affected demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including the company s systems 
these and other factors significantly reduced the company s revenue and profitability in fiscal the company s total net revenue for fiscal was million  compared with total net revenue of million in fiscal this decline occurred primarily in the company s factory systems and oem systems businesses 
in fiscal  the company incurred a net loss of million  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal these losses included special charges  including charges for restructuring and personnel reductions related to cost cutting measures the company took in response to the industry downturn 
if the company takes cost cutting measures in response to another downturn in the semiconductor industry  the company may be unable to continue to invest in marketing  research  development and engineering at the levels the company thinks is necessary to maintain its competitive position 
the company s failure to make these investments could seriously curtail its long term business prospects 
the company may have difficulty managing its operations in response to fluctuating demand 
the company s systems  procedures  controls and staffing may not be adequate to support rapid growth in its operations 
for example  in fiscal year  the company encountered manufacturing and supply chain problems relating to the company s turbostocker product  which the company had planned to begin manufacturing in high volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in response to increased customer demand 
these problems caused the company s revenues for the fourth quarter and fiscal year to be lower than expected and contributed to the company s net loss for these periods 
these problems will continue to affect the company s revenues and profitability in the first half of fiscal  and if the company is unable to correct these problems in a timely manner  the adverse impact could be more prolonged 
the company s failure to respond effectively to fluctuating demand for its products and to manage its manufacturing and other operations and its future growth  if any  could seriously harm its business 
if the company fails to meet a customer s delivery or performance criteria  as has recently occurred in certain instances involving its new turbostocker product  the company could incur contract losses and late delivery penalties  lose business from that customer  suffer long term damage to its reputation and have higher warranty and service costs 
any of these results could seriously harm the company s business 
further  if the company is unable to expand its existing manufacturing capacity to meet demand  a customer s placement of a large order for the development and delivery of factory automation systems during a particular period might deter other customers from placing similar orders with the company for the same period 
it could be difficult for the company to rapidly recruit and train the substantial number of qualified engineering and technical personnel who would be necessary to fulfill one or more large  unanticipated orders 
the company s lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to anticipate sales 
the company s systems often have a lengthy sales cycle 
as a result  the company has difficulty anticipating the timing and amount of specific sales 
the company may also spend significant amounts of money and effort with no assurance that it will make a sale 
before buying one of the company s systems  a prospective customer must generally decide to upgrade or expand existing facilities or to construct new facilities 
these undertakings are major decisions for most prospective customers and typically involve significant capital commitments and lengthy evaluation and approval processes 
in addition  downturns in the semiconductor industry may cause prospective customers to postpone decisions regarding major capital expenditures  including purchases of the company s systems 
the company s operating results fluctuate significantly  and its stock price could fall if its operating results are below the expectations of analysts or investors 
many factors may cause the company s operating results to fluctuate significantly 
some of these factors are the timing of significant orders  the gain or loss of any significant customer  new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  the company s ability to manufacture and ship its products consistent with its customers expectations during periods of fluctuating demand caused by the cyclicality of the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  order cancellations and shipment reschedulings or delays  patterns of capital spending by the company s customers  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the pricing and the mix of products the company sells  cyclicality in the semiconductor industry and the markets served by the company s customers  the timing of any acquisitions and related costs  and changes in personnel and related costs 
in addition  because the company s services and maintenance revenue is largely correlated with its product and equipment revenue  a decline in product and equipment revenue could reduce services and maintenance revenue in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
if the company s operating results fall below the expectations of financial analysts or investors  its stock price could fall 
as a result of these factors and the other factors described in this section  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons to predict the company s future performance 
delay in the company s shipment of a single system could substantially decrease its sales for a period 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of its systems 
the purchase price of the company s systems generally ranges from million to million  and the company usually takes more than one or two fiscal quarters to deliver its systems 
as a result  any delay in the recognition of revenue for a single system could harm the company s results for a given accounting period 
if the company delays a shipment near the end of a fiscal period because  for example  the customer reschedules or cancels its order or the company encounters unexpected manufacturing difficulties  its sales in that fiscal period could fall significantly below the expectations of financial analysts and investors 
this could cause the company s stock price to fall 
new accounting guidance could result in delayed recognition of the company s revenues 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
the bulletin sets forth the sec s guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company will be required to apply the guidance in the bulletin in its financial statements beginning in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal the effects of applying this guidance with respect to the company s historical reported revenue will be reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment in its statement of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal the company has not completed its evaluation of the guidance in the bulletin as it relates to its business  and therefore cannot yet assess the likely impact of application of the guidance on its future results of operations  or the magnitude of the cumulative effect adjustment  if any  that may be required 
in certain situations  application of the guidance discussed in the bulletin could delay the recognition of revenue that might otherwise have been recognized in earlier periods 
as a result  the company s reported revenue could fluctuate more widely among fiscal periods in the future  and reported revenue for a particular fiscal period might not meet expectations 
a significant cumulative effect adjustment or delay in recognition of revenue resulting from application of the guidance in the bulletin  while not affecting the company s cash flow  could adversely affect its results of operations in one or more future periods  which could cause its stock price to fall 
the company typically charges a fixed price for a system  which leaves it vulnerable to cost overruns 
the company s operating results also fluctuate because its gross margins vary 
the company s gross margins vary for a number of reasons  including the mix of products the company sells  the average selling prices of products the company sells  the costs to manufacture  market  service and support the company s new products and enhancements  the costs to customize the company s systems  and the company s efforts to enter new markets 
the company typically charges a fixed price for its systems 
as a result  if the costs the company incurs in performing a contract exceed its expectations  the company generally cannot pass those costs on to its customer 
the company has significant fixed costs  which are not easily reduced during a downturn 
the company continues to invest in research and development  capital equipment and extensive ongoing customer service and support capability worldwide 
these investments create significant fixed costs that the company may be unable to reduce rapidly if the company does not meet its sales goals 
moreover  if the company lacks a significant backlog of orders for an extended period of time  the company may have difficulty planning its future production and inventory levels  which could also cause fluctuations in its operating results 
the company has a limited number of customers  and the loss  cancellation or delay of any order by these customers could harm its business 
historically  the company has derived a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers 
the company expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
the loss  cancellation or delay of any order by these customers could significantly reduce the company s revenue and harm its reputation in the industry 
sales to the company s top ten customers accounted for of its total net revenue in fiscal years and  and in fiscal year one customer  intel  accounted for  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s largest customers can change from year to year  as some customers complete large semiconductor fabrication facilities and others initiate new projects 
moreover  at least one of the company s significant customers has adopted a policy of maintaining multiple vendors for the products it purchases 
this kind of policy could limit the company s ability to sell its products to its customers 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with its customers  and as a result its customers could stop purchasing its products and services at any time 
none of the company s customers have any long term obligation to continue to purchase its products or services  and any customer could reduce or cease ordering its products or services 
the company s failure to obtain large orders from new or existing customers could seriously harm its business 
the company believes that sales to some of its customers will decrease in the near future as they complete their current purchases for new or expanded semiconductor fabrication facilities 
in the past  the company s customers have sometimes failed to place orders the company expected or have delayed or canceled delivery schedules as a result of changes in their requirements 
because of the long sales cycle for its products  the company may have difficulty in quickly replacing orders that its customers cancel or reduce 
when a customer cancels an order  the company s sales contract generally allows it to recover only its costs and a portion of its anticipated profits from the sale 
any order deferrals or cancellations could seriously harm the company s business 
demand for less expensive semiconductors is increasing pressure to reduce prices in the company s industry 
semiconductors are increasingly being incorporated into less expensive products  which limits the price that semiconductor manufacturers can charge for semiconductors 
as a result  semiconductor manufacturers face increasing pressure to reduce their costs  which in turn creates pressure on semiconductor equipment manufacturers  such as the company  to reduce the prices of their products 
the company believes that over time this trend will lead to lower prices  which would reduce its revenue and adversely affect its operating results 
industry consolidation and outsourcing of the manufacture of semiconductors to foundries could reduce the number of available customers 
the substantial expense of building or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is leading increasing numbers of semiconductor companies to contract with foundries  which manufacture semiconductors designed by others 
as manufacturing is shifted to foundries  the number of the company s potential customers could decrease  which would increase its dependence on its remaining customers 
recently  consolidation within the semiconductor manufacturing industry has increased 
if semiconductor manufacturing is consolidated into a small number of foundries and other large companies  the company s failure to win any significant bid to supply equipment to those customers could seriously harm its reputation and materially and adversely affect its revenue and operating results 
the company s ongoing investments in the asia pacific market may not be successful 
the company believes that its continued presence in the asia pacific market will be important to its long term future financial performance 
accordingly  the company expects to continue to invest significant resources to increase its presence in the asia pacific market 
many of the company s japanese competitors have longstanding collaborative relationships with japanese and other semiconductor manufacturers in the asia pacific region 
accordingly  the company may be unable to increase sales in the asia pacific semiconductor market 
this market  which includes south korea  taiwan  singapore  china and  most significantly  japan  represents a substantial percentage of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity 
the company has invested heavily in mm wafer technology  which is being adopted more slowly than expected  and competition for early mm orders may be intense 
the company has invested  and is continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the industry transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is occurring more slowly than expected  partly as a result of the recent period of reduced demand for semiconductors 
although a small number of pilot projects are currently in operation  no mm semiconductor fabrication facility is producing wafers in commercial quantities 
any significant delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology or the failure of the industry to adopt mm manufacturing technology  could significantly reduce the company s opportunities for future growth 
moreover  continued delay in the transition to mm technology could permit the company s competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products  and the company s competitive position in the market for mm products could be adversely affected by its recent manufacturing problems relating to its new mm turbostocker product 
manufacturers implementing factory automation in mm pilot projects may initially seek to purchase systems from multiple vendors 
competition  including price competition  for such early mm orders could be vigorous 
a vendor whose system is selected for an early mm pilot project may have  or be perceived to have  an advantage in competing for future orders  and thus the award to a competitor of one or more early mm orders could cause the company s stock price to fall 
it is difficult to hire and retain the managerial and technical employees that the company needs the company needs to hire additional management level employees and substantial numbers of employees with technical backgrounds for both its hardware and software engineering and technical support staffs 
the market for these employees is becoming increasingly competitive  and the company has occasionally experienced delays in hiring these personnel 
the company s failure or inability to recruit  retain and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis would adversely affect its ability to develop  manufacture  install and support its systems 
the company s international operations create special risks 
the company s net export sales to customers outside north america accounted for  and of its total net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its total net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the company s plan to expand internationally may distract its attention from its domestic operations and may absorb financial resources needed elsewhere 
the company s international operations are subject to additional risks  including unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  unstable political and economic environments  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  restrictions on exporting and importing technology  fewer protections for the company s intellectual property  longer sales cycles than with domestic customers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates could make it more difficult for it to compete with foreign manufacturers on price 
if the company s international sales increase relative to its total revenue  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on its operating results 
in any event  any of these factors could cause serious harm to the company s business 
the company faces significant competition from other automation companies  which may limit the prices the company can charge for its systems and may cause it to lose sales 
the company s factory systems division competes with daifuku  murata machinery  shinko electric and a number of other smaller foreign and domestic manufacturers of automated machinery used in semiconductor fabrication facilities 
the company s oem systems division competes with genmark automation  asyst technologies  brooks automation and a number of other foreign and domestic wafer handling robotics companies  including in house organizations of process tool manufacturers that develop their own automation technology  as well as other smaller robotics companies 
the company s software products compete with products provided by consilium  a subsidiary of applied materials  brooks automation and other vendors 
the company believes that competition in its industry is likely to intensify 
the company believes that  once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a vendor s equipment for a particular fab  the manufacturer may continue to rely upon that equipment for a specific application in other fabs 
accordingly  the company may have difficulty selling to potential customers that have selected a competitor s equipment  and the company expects that difficulty to last for a significant period of time 
however  at least one of the company s significant customers has adopted a policy of maintaining multiple vendors for the products it purchases 
this kind of policy could limit additional sales to existing customers 
in addition  the expected transition to mm technology may cause new competitors to enter the company s markets  which could diminish its competitive advantage with customers for whom the company are the incumbent supplier of automation equipment 
in the face of increased competition  the company may need to lower its prices  which could seriously harm its business 
the company must continually improve its technology to remain competitive 
technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the company s ability to compete will depend  in part  on its ability to develop and introduce more advanced systems at competitive prices and on a cost effective basis so as to enable its customers to integrate them into their operations either before or as they begin volume product manufacturing 
for example  as the semiconductor industry transitions from mm manufacturing technology to mm technology  the company believes it is important to its future success to develop and sell new products that are compatible with mm manufacturing technology 
if the company s competitors introduce new technologies  its sales could decline and its existing products could lose market acceptance 
the company s success in developing  introducing  selling and supporting more advanced systems depends upon many factors  including component selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  software development  product performance in the field  and effective sales  marketing  service and project management 
because the company must commit resources to product development well in advance of sales  its product development decisions must anticipate technological advances by leading semiconductor manufacturers 
the company may not be successful in that effort 
the company s inability to select  develop  manufacture and market new systems or enhance its existing systems could cause it to lose its competitive position and could seriously harm its business 
the company may experience delays in product development and technical difficulties that could delay new product introductions 
because the company s systems are complex and have a large number of components  there can be a significant lag between the time the company introduces a system and the time the company begins to produce that system in volume 
the company has experienced delays in introducing some of its systems and enhancements  such as its new turbostocker product  as well as certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with those systems and enhancements 
as the level of sophistication of technology in the semiconductor industry increases  the company has found it increasingly difficult to coordinate complex manufacturing equipment and software in its systems  to procure adequate supplies of specialized components  to train its technical and manufacturing personnel and to make the transition from low volume to high volume manufacturing of new products in a timely manner 
the company could experience similar delays and difficulties in the future 
in addition  the company must customize some of its systems to meet a customer s site or operating requirements 
the company s inability to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of any of its new systems or enhancements or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume in a timely manner could incur contract losses and late delivery penalties  impair its relationships with its customers  and seriously harm its business 
in addition  the company may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure that its new products function properly and reliably early in their life cycle  as in the case of its new turbostocker 
these costs could include greater than expected installation and support costs or increased materials costs as a result of expedited changes 
the company may not be able to pass these costs on to its customers 
any of these events could seriously harm the company s business 
future acquisitions may disrupt the company s operations 
the company acquired promis systems in march  the company acquired equipe and its european distributor  chiptronix handling systems  in the first half of and the company acquired interval logic corporation in the company actively pursues potential acquisitions  and any acquisition the company makes could disrupt its operations and seriously harm its business 
the company may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of acquired companies with its own operations 
the company may also be unable to successfully develop  market and sell their products 
any future acquisitions also pose additional risks  including diversion of the company s management s attention  loss of key employees of the acquired company  interruptions in the sales efforts of the acquired company  failure to integrate financial and accounting systems successfully  significant acquisition and integration expenses  and assumption of legal and other liabilities and risks 
any of these factors could seriously harm the company s business 
moreover  these and future acquisitions may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that the company anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as the company expected 
any such event could cause customer dissatisfaction and damage the company s reputation 
if the company issues equity securities to pay for an acquisition  the ownership percentage of its existing stockholders would be reduced 
if the company uses cash to pay for an acquisition  the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund its operations or for other purposes 
acquisition financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company may be required to amortize significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions  which could seriously harm its operating results 
the company depends on subcontractors and one or a few suppliers for some components and manufacturing processes 
for some components or specialized processes that the company use in its products  such as painting of system cabinets and enclosures  the company depends on subcontractors or has available only one or a few suppliers 
the company s reliance on subcontractors gives it less control over the manufacturing process and exposes it to significant risks  especially inadequate capacity  late delivery  substandard quality and high costs 
the company intends in the near future to outsource additional aspects of its manufacturing operations to additional subcontractors and suppliers 
the company could experience disruption in obtaining components the company needs for its products and may not be able to develop alternatives in a timely manner 
if the company is unable to obtain adequate deliveries of components for its products for an extended period of time  the company may have to pay more for inventory  parts and other supplies  seek alternative sources of supply or delay shipping products to its customers 
the company could also damage its relationships with customers 
any such increased costs  delays in shipping or damage to customer relationships could seriously harm the company s business 
the company depends on mordechai wiesler and mitchell g 
tyson 
the company s future success depends significantly on the skills  experience and efforts of its founder  and chairman of the board  mordechai wiesler  and its president and chief executive officer  mitchell g 
tyson 
the company also depends on other executive officers and key personnel 
many of these individuals would be difficult to replace 
the loss of mr 
wiesler  mr 
tyson or any other key person could seriously harm the company s business 
the company s software products may contain errors or defects that could result in lost revenue  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims with substantial litigation costs 
complex software products like the company s can contain errors or defects  particularly when the company first introduces new products or when the company releases new versions or enhancements 
defects or errors in current or future products  including fabuilder  promis  transnet and encore software  could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance  which would seriously harm its business and operating results 
in the past  the company has occasionally discovered software errors in its new software products and new releases after their introduction  and the company expects that this will continue 
despite internal testing and testing by current and potential customers  the company s current and future products may contain serious defects 
because many of the company s customers use its products for business critical applications  any errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to its customers and could significantly impair their operations 
the company s customers could seek to recover damages from it for losses related to any of these issues 
a product liability claim brought against the company  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect the company s marketing efforts 
the company may be unable to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon its patent for certain key elements of its aerotrak monorail system  its other patents  its source code and its other proprietary technology 
the steps the company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate 
if so  the company might not be able to prevent others from using what the company regards as its technology to compete with it 
for example  its patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and the rights the company has under its patents could provide no competitive advantages 
existing trade secret  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect its proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating its proprietary rights 
any misappropriation of its technology or the development of competitive technology could seriously harm the company s business 
if the company has to resort to legal proceedings to enforce its intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
claims by others that the company infringes their proprietary technology could harm the company s business 
third parties could claim that the company s products or technology infringe their patents or other proprietary rights 
although the company conducts patent searches to determine whether the technology used in its products infringes patents held by third parties  these searches are not comprehensive and may not reveal potential third party claimants 
any claim of infringement by a third party could cause the company to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract the company s management from its business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires the company to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent the company from selling its products 
any of these events could seriously harm the company s business 
if anyone asserts a claim against the company relating to proprietary technology or information  the company might seek to license their intellectual property or to develop non infringing technology 
the company might not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms or on any terms 
alternatively  the company s efforts to develop non infringing technology could be unsuccessful 
the company s failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights or to develop non infringing technology could prevent it from selling its products and could therefore seriously harm its business 
the market price of the company s common stock is volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so 
for example  during fiscal year the closing price of its stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of the company s common stock to rise and fall 
these factors include variations in the company s quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  introduction of new products or new pricing policies by the company or the company s competitors  announcements by the company or the company s competitors of significant customer orders  acquisitions or strategic alliances by the company or others in the company s industry  the hiring or departure of key personnel  changes in the semiconductor industry cycle  changes in market valuations of companies within the semiconductor industry  and changes in estimates of the company s performance or recommendations by financial analysts 
when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
on november   and november   the company and three of its directors were named as defendants in two virtually identical lawsuits claiming  among other things  that the defendants violated securities laws and regulations by virtue of statements and omissions that the plaintiffs claim were materially false or misleading 
the plaintiffs each seek certification as a class  damages  pre judgment and post judgment interest  costs  and attorneys fees 
the company strongly believes that the lawsuits lack merit and it intends to defend against the claims vigorously 
however  the company could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuits 
the lawsuits could also divert the time and attention of the company s management 
the company cannot predict the outcome of the lawsuits at this time  and can give no assurance that they will not materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain 
the company expects its existing cash and investment balances  funds available under its revolving credit facility agreement and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures during at least the next twelve months 
after that  the company may need to raise additional funds and the company cannot be certain that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  if the company issues additional equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if the company cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  the company may not be able to develop or enhance its products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  grow its business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm its business 
provisions of the company s charter and by laws and massachusetts law make a takeover of the company more difficult 
the company s basic corporate documents  its stockholder rights plan and massachusetts law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of the company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to its stockholders

the company is still evaluating sab and its impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and exchange rate risk the company conducts a portion of its business outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries 
the company has foreign currency exposure related to its operations in international markets  where it transacts some business in foreign currencies  and accordingly the company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in local currencies 
consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the translation of foreign statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the functional currency is the us dollar for all of the company s subsidiaries  and therefore  translation gains and losses are included as a component of net income or loss 
substantially all of the company s revenue is invoiced and collected in us dollars 
at september  the company had no outstanding forward currency contracts 
market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company currently does not use financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes  due to its limited exposure in these areas
