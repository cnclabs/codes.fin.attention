item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through its operating partnerships and their subsidiaries  the partnership is principally engaged in the pipeline transportation of refined petroleum products and the refining of transmix 
products transported via pipeline include gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil and kerosene 
the partnership s revenues derived from the transportation of refined petroleum products are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines  and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
the partnership s revenues derived from the refining of transmix are principally a function of the wholesale market price of the refined products produced and the number of barrels of refined products sold 
results of operations are affected by factors that include general economic conditions  weather  competitive conditions  demand for refined petroleum products  seasonal factors and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with revenue from the transportation of refined petroleum products for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million in volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in revenue from the transportation of gasoline increased by million  or percent  over levels 
the revenue increase is primarily related to gasoline volume increases of  barrels per day  or percent more than volumes 
deliveries to the upstate new york area  which are longer haul and at higher tariff rates  were the primary cause of the increased gasoline revenue and volumes 
demand in the pittsburgh  pennsylvania  toledo  ohio and inwood  new york areas also increased over levels 
offsetting these increases were declines in volume to eastern and central ohio locations 
revenue from the transportation of distillate volumes increased by million  or percent  over levels 
the revenue increase is primarily related to distillate volume increases of  barrels per day  or percent more than volumes 
in the east  volumes were higher throughout most market areas as degree days were percent higher during the first quarter of than the first quarter of in the midwest  distillate revenues were up slightly despite declines in volumes due to the expiration of an incentive tariff early in the year 
the long island  connecticut and massachusetts markets experienced modest growth in distillate revenues and volumes during revenue from the transportation of jet fuel volumes increased by million  or percent  over levels 
the revenue increase is primarily related to jet fuel volume increases of  barrels per day  which were percent greater than volumes 
these increases are related to increased demand at pittsburgh  pennsylvania  jf kennedy  new york and newark  new jersey airports in the east and at detroit  michigan airport in the midwest 
in addition  new jet fuel business at huntington  indiana added to the favorable variance 
revenue from the transportation of lpg volumes and other petroleum products declined by million  or percent  from levels with most of the decline occurring at toledo  ohio 
transportation revenue from bgc s operations beginning march  date of acquisition through december  amounted to million 
refining revenue beginning march  date of acquisition through december  was million 
revenue was derived from the sale of million gallons of gasoline and million gallons of distillate products 
revenue from the sale of gasoline was million while revenue from the sale of distillate products was million 
costs and expenses for were million and included million in expenses related to the refining operations of brc and million in expenses related to bgc s operations 
excluding the expenses of brc and bgc  operating expenses were million  million or percent below costs and expenses of million incurred during during  the partnership settled a real property tax dispute with the city and state of new york  which resulted in a one time property tax expense reduction of million 
payroll costs also declined as severance related provisions and costs associated with the realignment of senior management occurring in did not recur in outside service costs and maintenance material expense also declined in offsetting these decreases were increases in provisions for environmental costs and increased power costs associated with the higher level of volumes delivered 
other expenses for were million compared to million in interest expense increased due to additional borrowings used to finance acquisitions 
in addition  incentive compensation payments to the general partner that are based on the level of partnership distributions were approximately million greater during than compared with revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent less than revenue of million for volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the combination of higher volumes and lower revenues in as compared to is the result of several factors 
in  the partnership experienced a slight shift in deliveries from longer haul  higher tariff movements to shorter haul  lower tariff movements 
in addition  certain tariffs designed to recover capital costs expired in and were replaced by lower tariffs 
the partnership also had greater costs associated with product downgrades resulting from normal operating activities 
gasoline volumes and revenue increased over levels 
new business was gained at midland  pennsylvania as a result of a new connection  and market share throughout pennsylvania continued to grow in in addition  increased volumes in the detroit and flint  michigan areas added to the favorable variance 
offsetting these increases were declines in volume to the upstate new york area 
distillate volumes and revenue declined over levels 
demand was weak throughout most areas due to abnormally warm weather primarily during the first quarter of jet fuel volume increased slightly over levels although overall revenue declined 
demand was strong at newark airport but was offset by declines at pittsburgh due to reductions in both military and commercial airline activity 
lpg volumes and revenue increased over levels due to the capture of new business in ohio 
tariff rate increases implemented in also had a favorable impact on revenues 
see tariff changes 
costs and expenses during were million  million or percent less than costs and expenses of million during during  as part of a restructuring  the partnership incurred severance and related expenses of million and an additional million expense associated with the realignment of senior management 
payroll overhead expenses declined as a result of the esop restructuring in and a full year effect of the elimination of certain executive compensation costs formerly charged to the partnership 
such senior executive compensation costs have not been charged to the partnership since august  see executive compensation 
the partnership also realized cost reductions in outside service expense and incurred less power expense during partially offsetting these reductions was the full year effect of amortization of the deferred charge related to the issuance of lp units under the esop restructuring 
other income expenses consist of interest income  interest and debt expense  minority interests and other 
total other expenses decreased by million 
interest expense declined by million due to the early extinguishment of higher interest rate debt with the proceeds of lower interest rate debt during december partially offsetting these declines in expenses were increased incentive compensation payments to bmc as a result of greater cash distributions to unitholders see certain relationships and related transactions and an increase in minority interest expense related to greater net income 
income from invested cash also declined from levels 
tariff changes effective january  certain of the operating partnerships implemented tariff increases that were expected to generate approximately million in additional revenue per year 
the operating partnerships did not file any general tariff rate increases that became effective during or competition and other business conditions several major refiners and marketers of petroleum products announced strategic alliances or mergers in recent years 
these alliances or mergers have the potential to alter refined product supply and distribution patterns within the operating partnerships market area resulting in both gains and losses of volume and revenue 
while the general partner believes that individual delivery locations within its market area may have significant gains or losses  it is not possible to predict the overall impact these alliances or mergers would have on the operating partnerships business 
however  the general partner does not believe that these alliances or mergers will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition

the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to each site  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or of any future claims and proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the partnership s results of operations  the consolidated financial position or operating cash flows 
the partnership is not exposed to any market risk due to rate changes on its senior notes but is exposed to market risk related to the interest rate on its credit agreement 
the partnership is also exposed to market risk on commodity futures contracts that it holds for the sale of gasoline and fuel oil 
market risk other than trading instruments the partnership has market risk exposure on its credit agreement due to its variable rate pricing that is based on the bank s base rate or at a rate based on libor 
as of december   a percent increase or decrease in the applicable rate under the credit agreement will result in an interest expense fluctuation of approximately million 
as of december   the partnership did not have any debt outstanding that was subject to variable rate pricing 
market risk trading instruments the partnership hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to inventory price fluctuations with commodity futures contracts for the sale of gasoline and fuel oil 
at december   the partnership had hedged approximately percent of brc s inventory and held commodity futures contracts for the sale of million gallons of gasoline and million gallons of fuel oil 
a per gallon increase in the market price of gasoline and fuel oil would result in a loss of approximately  in the futures contracts 
a per gallon decrease in the market price of gasoline and fuel oil would result in a gain of approximately  in the futures contracts
