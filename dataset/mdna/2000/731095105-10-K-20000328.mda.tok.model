factors that may affect future results some statements in this report may be forward looking in nature  or forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
these statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  plan  goal  outlook  target  intend  will  estimate and potential among others 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
the company therefore cautions shareholders and investors that actual results may differ materially from those projected in or implied by any forward looking statement as a result of a wide variety of factors  which include  but are not limited to those set forth below 
many of the important factors below have been discussed in prior filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
ability to revitalize the core imaging business revitalizing the company s core imaging business is an important part of its strategy 
to revitalize the core imaging business  the company s plan calls for  among other steps  the introduction of a number of new products each year  increased instant camera sales at profitable prices  continued penetration of retail outlets that are frequented by teens and young adults  the continued reduction of costs and the improvement of operating efficiencies from restructuring 
the company s plan to increase profits relies on successful implementation of this strategy 
as part of this strategy  the company is promoting new uses of  and new markets for  its products and technology and is targeting new demographic segments  such as children  teens and young adults  through product innovations and marketing campaigns 
in addition to these marketing campaigns  it is necessary to promptly design  develop  manufacture  market and deliver innovative imaging products to market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively implement this strategy on a continuous basis 
if this strategy is not successful  the company s business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
similarly  a decline in retail demand could have a material effect on the company s business and financial results 
developing digital imaging products market the company s plans to develop its digital imaging business call for  among other things  the transfer of the company s technology and expertise in instant imaging to the developing market for digital imaging products  the commercialization of products that show promise and the development  manufacture and marketing of new digital imaging products in anticipation of changing trends among end users of these products 
the company faces several risks in implementing this strategy  including its ability to successfully anticipate and respond to trends in the rapidly changing digital imaging business  to develop and market new digital imaging products in a timely and profitable manner  to develop relationships and alliances with other companies in the field and to market digital imaging products in a focused and effective way 
the digital imaging business is highly competitive 
in addition  the digital imaging business  for many companies  carries high research and development and other costs and is a relatively low margin business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively or profitably in the digital imaging business on a continuous basis 
in addition  the market for digital imaging products is evolving in rapid and  in some cases  unpredictable ways and may erode the growth or absolute size of the company s instant imaging business 
highly competitive markets the timing and introduction of new products by the company s competitors could have a material negative impact on the company s introduction of new or enhanced products 
the company has competitors worldwide  ranging from large corporations to smaller and more specialized companies 
in the instant imaging market  the company faces competition from fuji photo film co  ltd 
fuji  which has introduced selected new products in japan and europe 
in the digital imaging market  the company faces competition from eastman kodak company  fuji  hewlett packard company  canon usa  inc  sony corporation  and others 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully on a continuous basis and its failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 
net losses the company has experienced net losses in prior years 
if net losses were to recur  the company may be required to find additional sources of funding to fund operating deficits  implement its business strategy and meet anticipated capital expenditures  research and development costs and financing commitments 
there can be no assurance that if the company needs to obtain additional financing  that it will find it on acceptable terms or that it would be permitted under the amended credit agreement  the uk credit agreement or the indenture governing the notes 
substantial level of debt the company has a significant amount of debt 
the company s level of debt could have important consequences to investors or stockholders 
for example  it could make it more difficult to satisfy its debt and other obligations  increase the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit the company s ability to fund future working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its debt  thereby reducing the availability of the company s cash flow to fund working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared with its competitors that are less leveraged and limit its ability to borrow additional funds 
restrictions imposed by the company s debt and financial flexibility the company has financial and other restrictive covenants in the company s debt instruments including restrictions in the event of a change in control 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the amended credit agreement  the uk credit agreement  the indenture governing the notes and certain of the agreements governing short term lines of credit 
if such default is not cured or waived  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt  to execute its business strategy  to make capital expenditures and to fund research and development costs will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  exchange rate fluctuation and other factors  including retail demand and dealer inventory practices  that are beyond the company s control 
it is also subject to the company s success in implementing its strategies 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the amended credit agreement  the uk credit agreement or short term lines of credit in an amount sufficient to enable the company to repay its debt and to fund other liquidity needs 
customer concentration one customer  wal mart stores  inc  wal mart comprises over of the company s net sales 
net sales to this customer as a percentage of the company s annual net sales totaled in  in and in if wal mart or several of the company s other top customers were to stop purchasing the company s products or significantly change their purchasing practices  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations the company sells and markets its products worldwide 
a major risk associated with the company s worldwide operations is the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen and euro 
although the company engages in some foreign currency hedging  fluctuations in foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of the company 
failure to reduce cycle time the company has already reduced and is committed to further reduce its cycle time in bringing new products to market 
there is no guarantee that the company will succeed in this endeavor 
shorter cycle times present a challenge for the effective management of the transition from existing products to new products and could negatively impact the company s future operating results 
contract manufacturing  raw materials and supplies the company is dependent on certain sole source suppliers for certain finished products and components 
the company uses vendors to supply some of the raw materials and supplies necessary for the manufacture of its products  including chemicals  polyester film base  specialty paper and components 
the company is dependent on these suppliers ability to meet its production needs at a competitive cost and quality 
loss of patents and trademarks the company obtains patents where feasible to protect its investment in research and development 
the ownership of patents contributes to the company s ability to use its inventions and at the same time may provide significant patent license revenue 
in addition  the company owns a number of valuable trademarks  including the trademark polaroid  which are important to its business 
the loss of certain significant patents or trademarks would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
potential exposure to environmental liabilities the company s businesses and facilities are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
under certain environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of land may be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of hazardous materials at that property 
these laws typically impose a liability whether or not the owner or operator of the land knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous materials or for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials 
the owner or operator may also be liable for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment site  regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by that party 
because the company owns and operates a number of facilities and because it arranges for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites  the company expects to incur costs for investigation  removal and remediation  as well as capital costs associated with the compliance of these laws 
in addition  changes in environmental laws or unexpected investigations and clean up costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends on the continued contribution of a number of key senior managers and the loss of the services provided by them could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in particular  the loss of services provided by gary t 
dicamillo  the chairman and chief executive officer  as well as certain other senior managers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and development 
if that were to occur  there is no assurance that the company would be able to locate qualified personnel or employ them on acceptable terms or on a timely basis 
in addition  the company s continued growth depends in part on its continuing ability to attract and retain qualified senior managers who can implement the company s business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such senior managers 
impact of the year problem the failure of the company s material third party customers  suppliers and vendors to make their systems year compliant could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the year problem continues to have certain inherent risks that are difficult to measure and that could arise during there can be no assurance that the company or its material third party customers  suppliers and vendors will foresee all year problems that could yet occur during the year and be able to correct them on a timely basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates relative to its market risk sensitive instruments and positions as described below 
to reduce its risk and costs associated with its non functional currency operating activities  the company manages its exposures to foreign currency exchange rate changes through its operating and financing activities 
in this regard  the company borrows non functional currencies and purchases forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on its non functional currency net asset exposures 
in addition  the company purchases foreign currency options to protect a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated revenues from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the company does not purchase financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risks the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its borrowing activities 
the company borrows us dollars to fund its working capital and investment requirements 
the company borrows foreign currencies primarily to manage its non functional currency net asset exposures as more fully explained under foreign currency exchange within management s discussion and analysis of operations on pages to of the annual report  which pages are incorporated by reference 
the following table summarizes principal payments  related average interest rates by contractual maturity date and fair value information as of december  for the company s borrowing activities principal payments and interest rates by maturity dates as of december  due thereafter total fair value in millions  except average interest rate short term debt variable rate us us average interest rate variable rate non us non us average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us us average interest rate as more fully explained under foreign currency exchange within management s discussion and analysis of operations on pages to of the annual report  which pages are incorporated by reference  the company has used over the counter currency exchange swaps to reduce interest expense incurred on its foreign currency denominated debt 
however  there were no currency exchange swaps outstanding at december  for information about the company s short term and long term debt  see note  short term debt  on pages to of the annual report and note  long term debt on page of the annual report  which pages are incorporated by reference 
foreign currency exchange risk as more fully explained under foreign currency exchange within management s discussion and analysis of operations on pages to of the annual report  which pages are incorporated by reference  the company purchases us dollar call foreign currency put options which allow it to protect a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated revenues 
the company also uses forward exchange contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on its net monetary assets denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
the purchased currency options and forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  were primarily denominated in japanese yen and euros 
because the impact of purchased options and forward exchange contracts were not material to the company s financial position at december  or the results of its operations for the year then ended  the effect of an assumed adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates on the contracts outstanding at december  would not be material to the company s financial position or results of its operations 
the company does not quantify foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its expected foreign currency denominated revenues or its net monetary assets denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
however  these exclusions do not affect the usefulness of the sensitivity analysis related to the fair value of the company s outstanding option contracts or its outstanding forward exchange contracts
