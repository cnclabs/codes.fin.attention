earnings in were favorably affected  compared to  by increased non interest income  a reduction in non interest expense reflective of continued expense controls  a lower loan loss provision in recognition of improvements in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  and a slight increase in net interest income primarily due to higher average earning asset balances partially offset by lower net interest margin 
during  the company benefited from lower non interest expense reflecting cost controls exercised after the vallicorp holdings  inc merger the merger  a lower loan loss provision resulting from improved credit quality and lower net credit losses  and higher non interest income 
prior year non interest expense included approximately million million after tax in charges associated with the merger effected on april  lower net interest income was primarily the result of lower earning asset yields in part offset by a decrease in funding costs 
the company s return on average total assets was percent in  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
return on average equity in was percent  compared to percent and percent in the two previous years 
net interest income the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income fte in increased thousand from to million 
comparing to  net interest income fte decreased thousand 
components of net interest income in millions interest income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte net interest margin fte interest income fte decreased million from to  primarily due to a basis point decrease in earning asset yields  a combination of basis points lower loan yields and a basis points decrease in investments yields 
these changes were reflective of a general decline in market rates  resulting in all categories of loan and investment securities yields being lower than the prior year 
partially offsetting these changes  earning asset average balances increased million from  with loan and investment securities average balances increasing million and million  respectively  from the increase in loan balances was primarily concentrated in targeted commercial credits with real estate collateral and automobile dealer paper  partially offset by decreases in commercial  residential real estate and other consumer loans  including revolving lines of credit 
the increase in investment securities portfolio balances was comprised of higher us agency  tax free state and municipal securities as well as corporate securities  partially offset by decreases in us treasury and participation certificates average balances 
the revenue decrease in was more than offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
this was the result of a decrease of basis points in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities combined with a million increase in the average balance of interest free demand deposits  in part offset by a million increase in the interest bearing liabilities average balances 
interest income fte in decreased million from  primarily due to a basis point decrease in loan yields  reflecting the general interest rate environment  partially offset by an increase of basis points in investment yields  resulting in a combined decrease of basis points in earning asset yields 
the effect of this decline was in part offset by a million increase in average balances  with loans and investment securities growing million and million  respectively  from levels 
the increase in loans was concentrated in targeted commercial and residential real estate credits  and the increase in investment balances was primarily due to increases in tax free and corporate securities 
the decrease in interest income during was partially offset by a million reduction in interest expense 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of basis points in rates paid on deposits combined with an million increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits  in part offset by a million increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of u 
s treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the investment securities held to maturity is to strengthen the portfolio yield  and to provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the banks liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the company held million classified as investments available for sale

asset quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and increase diversification of earning assets 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all non performing assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following summarizes the company s classified assets for the periods indicated at december  in millions classified loans other classified assets total classified assets classified loans at december  decreased million or percent to million from december   reflecting the implementation of the company s active work out standards and charge offs 
other classified assets decreased million from prior year  due to sales and write downs of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt other real estate owned partially offset by new foreclosures on loans with real estate collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on non accrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing non accrual and are included in total non performing assets 
when the ability to fully collect non accrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that point are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
performing non accrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the non performing assets of the company for the periods indicated at december  in millions performing non accrual loans non performing non accrual loans non accrual loans restructured loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total non performing assets allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing assets performing non accrual loans increased million to million at december  while non performing non accrual loans decreased million to million during the same period  primarily due to the sales  payoffs and foreclosures of commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the million decrease in other real estate owned balances from december  was due to write downs and liquidations net of foreclosures on real estate property acquired in satisfaction of debt 
the decrease in non performing loans from to was primarily due to sales  payoffs and foreclosures of commercial loans with real estate collateral acquired through the merger 
the decrease in other real estate owned balances at december  from december  was also due to write downs and liquidations net of foreclosures 
the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded for non accrual loans if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period  was thousand in  thousand in and million in the amount of interest income that was recognized on non accrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and non performing non accrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared to thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  the total non performing assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain non performing asset levels  however  no assurance can be given that additional increases in non accrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based upon specific conditions  credit loss experience  the amount of past due  non performing loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the allowance is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines due to their small balances and numerous accounts are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
a portion of the allowance is also allocated to impaired loans 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which constituted percent of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
however  while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans on which the loss is considered probable  the risk exists of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future allowance levels 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated in thousands total loans outstanding      average loans outstanding during the period      analysis of the reserve beginning balance      additions to the reserve charged to operating expense      allowance acquired through merger  credit losses commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction  real estate residential   consumer      total      credit loss recoveries commercial and commercial real estate      real estate construction real estate residential consumer      total      net credit losses      balance  end of period      net credit losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december for the years indicated loans loans loans allocation as allocation as allocation as of the percent of the percent of the percent allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total balance loans balance loans balance loans dollars in thousands commercial    real estate construction    real estate residential consumer    unallocated portion of the reserve    total    loans loans allocation as allocation as of the percent of the percent reserve of total reserve of total balance loans balance loans dollars in thousands commercial   real estate construction   real estate residential   consumer   unallocated portion of the reserve   total   the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial loss risk 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in non accrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated at december  in thousands non accrual loans   other   total impaired loans   specific reserves   the million balance in loans classified as impaired as of december   other than non accrual loans  is due to two commercial real estate loans  with combined principal outstanding balances of million  having collateral exposure that may preclude ultimate full repayment  and one credit classified as a troubled debt restructuring with principal outstanding of million 
payments on these credits were current as of december  the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the amount of that recorded investment for which there is no related allowance for credit losses was in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructurings or loans that are classified as non accrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may increase the company s interest rate risk position in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a flat interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling rate scenario  where the federal funds rate  serving as a driver  is made to rise or fall evenly by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
company policy requires that such simulated changes in nii should always be less than percent or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
according to the same policy  if the simulated changes in nii reach percent  a closer inspection of the risk will be put in place to determine what steps could be taken to control risk 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in nii  based on the month period ending december  changes in estimated increase interest decrease in nii rates estimated basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  repricing within days non over repricing total in millions assets investment securities   loans   other assets total assets   liabilities non interest bearing interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings debt financing and notes payable other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity    net liabilities assets subject to repricing  cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing   the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturity  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitivity loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed 
liquidity the principal sources of asset liquidity are marketable investment securities available for sale 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled million 
in addition  the company generated significant liquidity from its operating activities 
the company s profitability in  and generated substantial cash flows  included in the total provided from operations  of million  million and million  respectively 
additional cash flows may be provided by financing activities  primarily the acceptance of customer deposits and short and long term borrowings from banks 
during  the effect of the company s stock repurchase program and dividends paid to shareholders of million and million  respectively  in addition to a million decrease in customers deposits and the repayment of million in long term debt and debt financing  was offset by an increase of million in short term borrowings 
the combination of these factors resulted in a total of million in net cash provided by financing activities during conversely  during  customers deposits increased million and stock issued primarily for stock option exercises totaled million  but these cash inflows were offset by cash used by the company for its share repurchase program and other retirement of stock activities  totaling million  dividends paid to the company s shareholders for million and reductions in short term borrowings and debt financing in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
during  decreases in deposits of million  repurchases and retirements of the company s common stock of and dividends paid to shareholders and retirement of repayments of notes payable and debt financing of million and million  respectively  were partially offset by a million increase in short term borrowings 
these were the major factors affecting net cash flows used in financing activities of million and million  respectively  for the years and the company uses cash to make investments in loans and in investment securities 
net disbursements of loans were million in and  in addition  during  the company increased by million its investment securities portfolio  primarily in us agencies and municipal securities  partially offset by decreases in us treasury and asset backed securities 
net disbursements of loans were million in  compared to net repayments of loan balances of million in as a result of the increase in loan volume in  the company reduced its investment in securities by million in however  the intention of the company is to increase loan volume without jeopardizing credit quality  this was the primary reason for investing excess cash flows in lower risk investment securities in  which increased million during that year 
the company anticipates increasing its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
for the same period  it is anticipated that the investment securities portfolio and demand for loans will continue to increase moderately 
the growth in deposit balances is expected to follow the anticipated growth in loan and investment balances through the end of line of credit on july   the company entered into an agreement with a well established financial institution  establishing a line of credit for general corporate purposes including the repurchase of its stock 
the line of credit has a one year term and an available commitment amount ranging from million  during the first nine months  reduced by million during each of the following three months to million 
the interest rate on this line of credit is set by the lender based on various factors  including costs and desired return  general economic conditions and other factors 
during the third quarter of  the company elected to cancel this line of credit  replacing this available source of cash inflow with increased cash dividends from its affiliates 
capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
since the beginning of and through december   the board of directors of the company has authorized the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock from time to time  subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
the company acquired million shares of its common stock in the open market during  thousand in  million in  and million  thousand and thousand in  and  respectively 
these repurchases were made periodically in the open market with the intention to lessen the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock performance  option plans  acquisitions and other requirements 
in addition to these systematic repurchases  a new plan to repurchase million additional shares of the company s common stock was approved by the board of directors on august  this program supercedes the authorization of repurchasing million additional shares of the company s common stock approved by the board of directors on june  the company s strong capital position and healthy profitability contributed to the initiation of these programs  which were being implemented to optimize the company s use of equity capital and enhance shareholder value 
pursuant to these programs  the company repurchased million and million shares of its common stock during and  respectively 
the average price of these repurchases were and per share  respectively  for and the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which decreased million or percent from the previous year end and decreased million or percent from december  the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  tier i risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was percent at december   compared to percent at december  capital to risk adjusted assets minimum regulatory capital at december  requirements tier i capital total capital leverage ratio the risk based capital ratios declined in mainly due to reductions in equity capital resulting primarily from share repurchase programs 
capital ratios are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is adequate to meet the company s future needs 
all ratios are in excess of the regulatory definition of well capitalized

the increase of million in non interest bearing demand deposits was partially offset by a million decrease in interest bearing transaction accounts primarily due to the transfer  during the third quarter of  of certain interest bearing transaction deposits into the non interest bearing category 
in addition  to compensate the combined total year to year balance runoff of million in savings account and retail certificates of deposit balances  time certificates of deposit of thousand or more increased million or percent from in  total average deposits decreased percent from primarily due to decreases in savings and retail certificates of deposits as a result of the anticipated runoff of business reflective of market conditions 
however  to counteract this effect  time certificates of deposit of thousand or more increased percent  and aggressive policies in place resulted in a percent increase in the average balance of non interest bearing and transaction demand accounts

merchant credit card income was thousand higher than  mainly due to fee restructuring and higher sales volume  service charges on deposit accounts were thousand higher than including higher fees from overdraft and non sufficient funds returned items  primarily due to the effect of new programs implemented in using a process of price escalators determined by volume by customer  and trust fees were thousand higher than a litigation settlement of million accounted for the majority of the increase in the other non interest income category 
partially offsetting these increases from prior year  mortgage banking income was thousand lower than  due to declining servicing income  lower gains on sales of loans in the secondary market and lower banking fees due to reduced refinancing volume 
non interest income was million in  thousand higher than gains realized on asset sales were million higher than prior year 
financial services commissions were thousand higher than primarily due to higher sales volume and additional products offered 
trust fees were thousand higher due to the company s continuing efforts to expand personal and retirement plan business
