item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and operating data  the description of the company s business operations  and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of the matters discussed in this annual report contain forward looking statements regarding the company s future business which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including competitive pressures  adverse economic conditions and government regulations 
these issues  and other factors  which may be identified from time to time in the company s reports filed with the sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
in a restructuring completed on december   the company acquired all of the assets and businesses formerly held by ffp partners  except that the real estate used in its retail operations was retained by ffp partners 
ffp partners also retained certain liabilities  principally bank debt and debt secured by the retained real estate 
all other liabilities including trade accounts payable  money orders payable  accrued expenses  deferred income taxes  obligations under capital leases and other debt secured by various equipment were transferred to the company 
the businesses transferred to the company include the operation of convenience stores  truck stops  and self service motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  motor fuel wholesaling activities  the sale of money orders through the outlets operated by the company and third party agents  and the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility 
the real estate retained by ffp partners is leased to the company for use in the conduct of its retail convenience store and motor fuel operations 
the selected financial data that accompanies this discussion reflects the historical operations of ffp partners to which the company succeeded in connection with the aforementioned restructuring 
however  the financial data for years prior to is not considered comparable to prior years in the following respects rental expense is included in and  but not in prior years  for the leasing of the real properties retained by ffp partners in the december restructuring  depreciation expense related to such real properties is not included for and nor will it be incurred in future years  but is included for prior years  and interest income received by the company from its note receivable from ffp partners is included in and but not in years prior to this note was repaid in full in october also in december  the company initially acquired additional convenience stores 
fourteen of the stores were sold to unrelated parties shortly thereafter  resulting in a net increase from these transactions of stores 
the purchase of the stores was completed in december and had little impact on results 
the results from operations from these stores had a positive impact on results in and and are expected to continue to have a similar impact in future years 
similarly  the company acquired additional convenience stores and truck stops in february the results from operations from these stores have also had a positive impact on results in and are expected to continue to have a similar impact in future years 
the company reports its results of operations using a fiscal year which ends on the last sunday in december 
most fiscal years have weeks  but some consist of weeks 
fiscal years    and were week years  while fiscal year was a week year 
this variation in time periods most affects revenues and related costs of sales and salary costs  as other expenses such as rent and utilities are usually recorded on a monthly basis 
however  differences in the number of weeks in a fiscal year should be considered in reviewing the financial data 
business segments the company and its subsidiaries conduct business in two primary business segments i the operation of retail convenience stores  truck stops  and motor fuel concessions at independently operated convenience stores  money orders sales through company stores and third party agents  underground tank monitoring and testing  and motor fuel wholesaling activities the retail and wholesale operations  and ii the operation of a motor fuel terminal and processing facility the terminal operations 
each of these business segments is subject to differing opportunities and challenges 
the following table sets forth certain information about each segment s financial information in   and retail and terminal wholesale operations eliminations consolidated in thousands revenues from external sources    revenues from other segment   depreciation and amortization   interest income   interest expense   loss before income taxes and extraordinary item extraordinary loss before tax effect total assets    capital expenditures   revenues from external sources    revenues from other segment   depreciation and amortization   interest income  interest expense   income loss before income taxes   total assets    capital expenditures   revenues from external sources   revenues from other segment   depreciation and amortization   interest income interest expense   income loss before income taxes total assets    capital expenditures    in the company will continue to analyze available opportunities to expand its retail and wholesale operations by acquiring additional convenience stores 
the acquisition of any additional stores will be dependent upon whether acceptable purchase prices  terms and properties can be found 
in february  the company acquired the operations of additional convenience stores and two additional truck stops  all in texas 
eleven of the stores are third party leasehold locations where the company purchased the existing leasehold interest 
the company s purchase of those leasehold interests was financed with a third party lender consisting of four fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  maturity dates ranging from to months  interest accruing at per annum  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
real estate at stores was purchased by ffp partners and immediately leased to the company under year leases 
the company s rental payments under those leases equal  per month 
the company guaranteed the acquisition indebtedness of ffp partners of  which amount is no greater than the company s aggregate rental payments to ffp partners over the initial year period of the leases 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expanded its terminal operations substantially with the commencement of a gasoline blending process at the terminal and an increase in its transmix business 
although management believes that this new blending process will become profitable in the future  it is a new processing procedure at the terminal and therefore subject to economic risks 
the company s terminal operations improved significantly in revenues from the terminal improved by   increasing from  in to  in most of that increase came in the fourth quarter of  and management believes that terminal operations will continue to show improvement in in september  the terminal began to purchase motor fuel at the terminal with deliveries made through a pipeline having an exit at the terminal  which allowed for substantially increased volumes at the terminal 
also in september  the volume of transmix fluid processed at the terminal was substantially increased 
in november  purchases of motor fuel through the pipeline were increased to  gallons of motor fuel per month 
in april  the company expects to increase that purchase volume to approximately  gallons per month via a second pipeline with an exit at the terminal 
as a result of the increased activity at the terminal in the fourth quarter of  the loss before income taxes from terminal operations improved to  reflecting a improvement compared to the loss before taxes from the terminal of  in compared with the company incurred a net loss before extraordinary items of  in  and a net loss of  in  compared to net loss of  in major reasons for the increased loss were the following gross margins from motor fuel retail sales decreased by cents per gallon in  interest expense increased by  in  and an extraordinary loss of   after taxes was incurred in connection with the refinancing as a result of writing off loan costs and paying prepayments penalties on the loans that were repaid 
in order to quantify the scope of the decrease in retail fuel margins  the company would have earned an additional  in motor fuel revenues in if the company s retail margins per gallon had remained constant during the year  although no assurance can be given that such hypothetical results were achieveable or that net earnings would have increased by the same amount 
the company s total revenues topped the half billion dollars for the first time in  as total revenues increased to  a increase over total revenues of  total revenues increased as a result of higher pricing of motor fuel and cigarettes and increased sales resulting from the additional stores acquired in february this  increase in total revenues is broken down as follows increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages motor fuel sales    merchandise sales    miscellaneous    total revenues    retail motor fuel sales increased by  gallons in over due to sales from the additional convenience stores acquired in february in addition  wholesale fuel sales increased by  gallons over the prior year 
total motor fuel sales  in dollars  increased by  in to  a improvement compared to  in the gross margin from motor fuel sales also increased in to  but only by increase compared to the gross margin of  gross margins also increased in as a result of the additional stores acquired in february and higher fuel prices in the company sold more motor fuel volume in  which offset a gross margin per gallon decline 
retail margins showed a cent per gallon decrease in compared to and was principally attributable to lower margins in the areas served by competing stores and truck stops 
wholesale per gallon margins were the same in when compared to  while the total whole gallons sold increased by 
for the first time  the company earned a margin on fuel sold from the terminal  cents per gallon margin on  gallons  calculated before reduction for intercompany sales 
in addition  the motor fuel mix between retail sales and wholesale sales influenced the decline in per gallon margins 
retail motor fuel sales  which have higher per gallon margins than wholesale  declined from of total motor fuel sales in to in a breakdown showing the company s  increase in fuel sales is shown in the table below increase amount percentage in thousands  except percentages retail motor fuel sales convenience stores    gas only outlets    truck stops    total retail    wholesales motor fuel sales    terminal motor fuel sales    other motor fuel sales   n a total motor fuel sales    merchandise sales improved to  in  a increase compared to  in this  increase resulted principally from a store increase in the average number of convenience stores operated in and higher cigarettes prices

the merchandise margin follows a five year trend of increasing merchandise margins 
for example  merchandise margins have increased from in to in  representing a overall increase during that five year period 
miscellaneous revenues increased by in to  representing a  increase as compared to  primarily due to the greater number of stores in operation for the full year 
miscellaneous revenues is one area of operations that the company emphasizes in its efforts to improve profitability

the company has initiated litigation to recover those bad debts and is optimistic that it will be able to recover substantial portion 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in reflecting the significant capital expenditures incurred by the company in the last few years  primarily related to the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet environmental regulatory requirements  the start of operations at the company s fuel terminal in mid  depreciation of equipment acquired in the acquisitions of convenience stores made in december and in february  and depreciation of buildings obtained under transactions accounted for as capital leases in february a  increase in interest expense in  as compared to  resulted primarily from additional long term debt incurred in and partially from higher interest rates in as a result of increasing interest rates in the past year  the company pursued long term fixed rate financing for a larger component in its capital structure 
most of the new debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of convenience stores in and convenience stores and truck stops in february the company s liquidity improved considerably in and is expected to allow the company to expand its retail  wholesale and terminal operations 
interest income rose significantly in by   compared to  primarily as a result of interest income earned on increasing investments in money market funds and other liquid investments during compared with the company incurred a net loss of  in  compared to net income of  in the major reasons for this decline are the following additional bad debt losses of  were incurred in in money order operations a substantial portion of which the company is currently seeking to recover  rent expense of  was paid in to ffp partners in the leasing of real property for certain of the company s retail sites  compared to none in  which was partially offset by an increase in interest income of  and a decrease in depreciation of  the company s terminal operations segment incurred a loss before income taxes of  in  compared to a segment loss of  and an income tax benefit of only  was recorded in compared to an  income tax benefit in the company s total revenues increased to  a increase over total revenues of  this increase resulted primarily from a  increase in merchandise sales  which was primarily attributable to merchandise sales at the additional stores acquired in december retail motor fuel sales increased by  gallons in over due to sales from the additional convenience stores acquired in december in addition  wholesale fuel sales increased by  gallons over the prior year 
total motor fuel sales  in dollars  were flat in  when compared to  because motor fuel sales prices were lower in as compared to the company sold more motor fuel volume in  which offset the price decline 
in addition  the company s margin on such sales increased by  over levels 
retail fuel gross profit increased in absolute and per gallon terms 
retail margins showed a cent per gallon increase in over and was principally attributable to higher margins in the areas served by the additional stores acquired by the company in december a cent per gallon decline in wholesale margins resulted primarily from competitive pricing pressure from other wholesalers in the texas wholesale markets served by the company 
merchandise sales improved from  in to  in this large increase resulted principally from an increase of stores in the average number of convenience stores in  a increase over  which was partially offset by a decline in the average weekly merchandise sales to  per convenience store 
major categories of merchandise sales in were grocery sales  deli and restaurant sales  soft drink sales  beer and wine sales  cigarette sales  fast food sales  and money order equipment and supplies 
the company s gross profit on merchandise sales increased by  in this increase came from two sources the additional merchandise gross profit realized from the stores acquired in december  and an increase in gross margin on merchandise sales to in  compared to in this increase in merchandise margins follows a five year trend of increasing merchandise margins 
for example  merchandise margins have increased from in to in  representing a overall increase during that five year period 
miscellaneous revenues increased significantly to  in  representing a  increase in as compared to  primarily due to the greater number of stores in operation for the full year 
miscellaneous revenues is one area of operations that the company emphasizes in its efforts to improve profitability 
categories of miscellaneous income include money order fees  lottery ticket revenue  pay phone and calling card income  automated teller machine income  gasoline excise tax handling fees  check cashing fees  game machine income  gain or loss on property sales  interest income  scale charges and copier income 
direct store expenses those costs directly attributable to the operation of retail outlets  such as salaries and other personnel costs  supplies  utilities  rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance  and commissions paid to the operators of the self service motor fuel outlets increased by  in  compared to direct store expenses in this increase was primarily attributable to the stores acquired during december the remaining increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased wage costs  related to the federally mandated minimum wage increase which took effect on september  since the december restructuring of ffp partners  all of the real estate used in the company s retail operations was retained by ffp partners and is now leased to the company 
as a result  rent expense increased by  in general and administrative expenses increased  in over of this amount   resulted from increased bad debt expense arising out of the money order operations  a substantial portion of which the company is currently seeking to recover 
in addition  a full year of costs were incurred in for wages and initial operating costs at the company s fuel terminal and processing facility opened in mid  and for field supervisory personnel added in december to manage the additional stores acquired in late depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  in reflecting the impact of increased charges related to the company s significant capital expenditures in the last three years  primarily related to the upgrading of the company s underground storage tanks to meet environmental regulatory requirements  the start of operations at the company s fuel terminal in mid  and depreciation of equipment acquired in the late acquisition of convenience stores 
offsetting the foregoing was a decline in depreciation expense of  attributable to buildings that were retained by ffp partners in the december restructuring 
a  decrease in net interest expense in  as compared to  was the result of lower interest rates during and the receipt of interest income of  from ffp partners in the second half of partially offsetting that reduction in interest expense was additional interest incurred as a result of increased borrowings to fund the company s financing of its december purchase of convenience stores  investment in its fuel terminal and processing facility  and purchase of equipment to upgrade its underground storage tanks to meet environmental standards that became effective in december as a partnership  the company paid no federal or state income tax prior to the december restructuring of ffp partners 
rather  the income or loss of the company was allocated to its partners to be included in their respective income tax returns 
because the company expected to become taxable as a corporation beginning in  applicable accounting pronouncements required it to record a tax liability for those taxes it would have to pay on items of income and expense recognized for financial reporting purposes before but which would be recognized for tax reporting purposes in or later years 
accordingly  the company provided for these deferred tax expenses in its consolidated statements of operations  while the current tax benefit of the deferral of the recognition of income  or the acceleration of expenses  for tax purposes was allocated the company s partners 
the primary items giving rise to differences between financial and tax reporting were differences in the tax bases and depreciation methods of the company s fixed assets 
in  the company was able to substantially shorten the lives over which certain buildings used in its retail operations were depreciated for tax purposes 
the benefit of this additional tax depreciation was allocated to the company s partners while the company was required to record a deferred tax expense related to it 
in connection with the december restructuring of ffp partners  the ownership of the depreciable real property that gave rise to the large deferred tax provision in was retained by ffp partners  which continues as a publicly traded limited partnership  and not distributed to the company 
accordingly  the deferred taxes attributable to these buildings were reversed in as a corporation  the company provides for both current and deferred federal and state income tax expense on its earnings or benefit on its loss 
for the company recorded an income tax benefit of  liquidity and capital resources the majority of the company s working capital is provided from three sources i liquid  short term investments since receiving the proceeds of the pay off of a note receivable from ffp partners in october  ii cash flows generated from its operating activities  and ii borrowings under its new revolving line of credit facility 
the company believes that these investments  operating activities  and short term working capital facilities  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund current commitments for operating and capital expenditure programs  as well as to service debt requirements 
actual capital expenditure funding will be dependent on the level of cash flow generated from operating activities and the funds available from financings 
the company s notes payable at year end and were  and  as summarized in the table below type of loan purpose of loan in thousands bank revolver operations  bank term note operations  equipment note store computers and equipment  store note financing of gas only conversion sewer financing truck stop improvements year financing purchase of stores   year financing purchase of stores year financing refinancing of bank debt  new line of credit operations of the total notes payable shown in the table above for   is classified as short term  and  is long term debt 
for   is classified as short term  and  is long term debt 
in june  the company refinanced its december purchase of convenience stores 
that financing consists of fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  an interest rate fixed at per annum  maturity dates ranging from to months  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
in june  the company refinanced all of its prior bank revolving credit facility and term loan and an equipment financing note 
that financing consists of fully amortizing loans in the aggregate original principal amount of  an interest rate fixed at per annum  maturity date in months  and aggregate payments of principal and interest of  per month 
the company has utilized the loan proceeds to repay the above described loans and for general corporate purposes 
in october  ffp partners repaid all of its indebtedness of  owed to the company and the company  in turn  repaid all of its debt of  to ffp partners 
the company had incurred that debt in february to purchase inventory and equipment at stores purchased by ffp partners and leased to the company at that time 
since october  those net funds of approximately  provided the company by the pay off by ffp partners have been invested in short term  liquid investments 
these funds earned approximately  plus interest in the last two months of and provide a new source of liquidity for future operations 
in december  the company obtained a new revolving line of credit providing for borrowings of up to  with the amount available at any time limited to a borrowing base equal to of certain of its trade receivables plus of its inventory at the terminal  provided  however  that any amounts which would cause outstanding borrowings under the facility to exceed  are limited to of the net value of debt and equity securities in the company s trading account at a brokerage firm 
at year end  the borrowing base was  but the company had not made any draws on such facility  and the net value at the brokerage firm was approximately  the revolving credit facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus one percentage point  payable monthly on amounts borrowed  and matures in december the loans are subject to a loan agreement and a security agreement between the lender  the company and two subsidiaries of the company 
the agreement contains numerous  but typical  restrictive covenants including a financial covenant relating to the maintenance of a specified fixed charge coverage ratio of to  all as defined in the agreement 
the loan is secured by all of the company s trade accounts receivables and inventory at the terminal 
when the company operated as a publicly traded limited partnership  it made cash distributions to its partners from time to time to provide funds for them to pay income taxes on the company s income that was allocated to them 
with the change in the company s tax status to a corporation  management does not currently anticipate that any dividends will be paid on the company s common stock in the foreseeable future 
the company s operating activities used  in net cash  compared to providing net cash of  in additional cash was required to fund increased inventory at the terminal and receivables on wholesale sales  which resulted from substantially increasing fuel purchases for the company s terminal and much higher fuel prices at the end of than at the end of this increase was offset in part by additional cash flows as a result of operating a greater number of convenience stores in than in the company s investment in property and equipment during rose to  an increase of  compared to the company s capital expenditures were principally utilized in acquiring new convenience stores and refurbishing company s stores 
in addition  the company received  from affiliated entities during in repayment of notes receivable from such entities 
net cash of  was provided by financing activities in  primarily as a result of additional long term borrowings with fixed interest rates 
subject to obtaining satisfactory deal terms  the company in intends to increase significantly the outright sales of convenience stores and or the sales of its convenience store to independent operators while retaining a motor fuel concession at those locations 
it has identified more than such convenience stores that it would consider converting to gas only stores in such a manner 
the company may or may not purchase additional convenience stores in and beyond as the convenience store industry goes through as period of greater competition and consolidation 
any such dispositions or acquisitions will impact the company s financial results and liquidity 
the company is party to commodity futures contracts and forward contracts to buy and sell fuel  both of which are used principally to satisfy balances owed on exchange agreements 
both of these types of contracts have off balance sheet risk as they involve the risk of dealing with others and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts and the risk associated with unmatched positions and market fluctuations 
the open positions under these contracts were not significant at year end see note to the consolidated financial statements 
over the last few years  the company s money order sales have increased significantly 
for example  money order payables at the end of fiscal year were  compared to money order payables of  at year end money order payables represent those sales of money orders for which the payee of the money order has not yet requested payment 
although the company collects money order receipts on a daily basis on sales of money orders made by its own stores  the company relies on receiving timely payment from its third party money order sales agents 
in the company incurred an additional bad debt loss from its money order operations 
the company is attempting to recover a substantial portion of these losses that were attributable to two reasons bank encoding errors and fraudulent actions by a third party money order agent 
the company s failure to receive money order payments on a timely basis from its money order agents could negatively impact the company s liquidity 
the company had positive working capital of  at the end of  compared to a negative  at year end  an improvement of  in past years  the company has been able to operate its business with minimal or negative working capital  principally because most of its sales are cash sales and it has received payment terms from vendors 
the improvement over working capital resulted primarily from the following in thousands additional cash and cash equivalents  additional trade receivables  additional inventories  additional short term investments  reduced money order payables  reduced notes receivable from affiliates  increased accounts payable  increased accrued expenses  other items the company believes that the availability of funds from its short term investments  store operations  its new revolving line of credit as discussed above  and its traditional use of trade credit will permit operations to be conducted in a customary manner 
year issues over the past several years  the company has prepared for the possible disruptions that might have resulted from the date change to year no significant year problems were experienced  and the company believes that no material exposure to year issues exist 
total expenditures related to modifications of existing software and conversions to new software for the year issue were approximately  of which approximately  was capitalized 
inflation and seasonality the company believes inflation can have a material effect on operating results 
one example is the upward pressure placed on wages caused by a low unemployment and a robust economy and  for store wages  by the federal minimum wage increases which took effect in and increased costs of in store merchandise can often be quickly reflected in higher prices to customers  but higher prices tend to reduce the demand for products 
the company s cost and prices for motor fuel and cigarettes increased significantly in significant increases in cigarette prices has been caused by a pass through of litigation costs in the tobacco industry 
motor fuel prices rose as a result of a significant increase in the prices charged for refined fuel products  which in turn was caused by a significant increase in crude oil prices 
management cannot make accurate predictions as to future increases in tobacco or fuel prices or in consumer demand for those products 
significant increases in the retail price of motor fuels tend to reduce fuel demand and the company s gross profit on fuel sales  reduce merchandise sales as fewer customers stop to purchase motor fuel  result in larger write offs of any bad debts on wholesale motor fuel sales that are considered uncollectible  raise the possibility that third party operators of convenience stores and money order sales agents will become more likely to default in paying their obligations to the company  and raise financing costs to carry accounts receivable and inventories 
the company s businesses are normally subject to seasonal influences  with higher sales being experienced in the second and third quarters of the year as customers tend to purchase more motor fuel and convenience items  such as soft drinks  other beverages  and snack items  during the warmer months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risks related to variable interest rates and commodity prices 
the interest rate calculated under the company s new line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest  which is subject to change and exposes the company to the possibility of increasing interest rates 
however  the company had not borrowed under that facility at year end as a result  all of the company s obligations at year end were not subject to interest rate risk because it had refinanced such indebtedness with fixed rate financing 
the company is also subject to the market risk of increasing commodity prices and sometimes attempts to hedge that risk by purchasing commodity futures and forward contracts 
an attempt to hedge that risk is subject to risk because the commodities subject to the hedging contract are not the same commodities as those owned by the company in its business 
open positions under these futures and forward contracts were not significant at year end or see note to the consolidated financial statements
