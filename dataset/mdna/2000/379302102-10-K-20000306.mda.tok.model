funds from operations management considers ffo to be a supplemental measure of the company s operating performance

ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as the primary indicator of the company s operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all entities recognize them as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and subsequently measure them at fair market value 
it also prescribes specific accounting principles to be applied to hedging activities and hedging transactions  which are significantly different from prior accounting principles 
the company has not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
year issues year issues had a minimal impact on the business  operations and financial condition of the company 
all known issues have been remedied  and we continue to exercise caution as we approach certain milestone dates 
with respect to its year readiness on its information technology it there were no hardware related issues 
all file servers  workstations and routers continue to function normally 
we experienced two software related issues 
one application displayed the wrong date in a non critical field 
this issue did not effect any monetary calculations  and the vendor promptly fixed it 
we also came across some other date related issues with microsoft access databases 
the year analysis software had failed to identify this issue 
this was due to the fact that the dates were stored in alphanumeric text fields 
this issue has since been identified  fixed and tested across all related databases 
with respect to its year reliability and condition of its non it systems  there were a total of three non it related issues 
one involved an obsolete time clock  which had been replaced but not removed from a property 
the other two issues involved improper year displays on electro mechanical equipment panels 
both units continued to function properly 
both display issues have been fixed 
the costs incurred by the company have been less then  and the company has not experienced any material adverse effect due to failure of any of its or its partner s systems 
our tenants did not report any failures 
even though the company has successfully completed the year end financial reporting with minimal impact  we continue to exercise caution as we approach critical dates like february  first quarter end and year end other the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when tenant occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  malls achieve most of their temporary tenant rents and percentage rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the retail industry has experienced some difficulty  which is reflected in sales trends and in the bankruptcies and continued restructuring of several prominent retail organizations 
continuation of these trends could impact future earnings performance 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents in the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may  however  have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company uses interest rate protection agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with long term  floating rate debt 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s debt  after giving effect to interest rate protection agreements  bore interest at fixed rates with weighted average maturity of years and years  respectively  and weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
the remainder of the company s debt bears interest at variable rates with weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s debt was million and million  respectively  compared to its carrying amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company s combined future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december  and  a basis points increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis points decrease in the market rates of interest would increase future earnings and cash flows by million and million  respectively  and increase the fair value of debt by approximately million and million  respectively
