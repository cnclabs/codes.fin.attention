acquisitions during and  the company acquired the following blocks of business in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired from pan american life insurance company pan american most of the health insurance business which is marketed to individuals and small employer groups 
effective july   the company assumed most of pan american s remaining domestic health insurance business

the company continues to actively seek opportunities for growth through acquisition 
management believes that as industry consolidation occurs  the company is in a position to take advantage of its operational efficiencies 
management will continue to evaluate potential targets for acquisition 
summary of results the company experienced a difficult and challenging year with disappointing financial results 
reserve strengthening charges totaling million after tax were recorded primarily relating to adverse medical loss ratio trends in its small group health business 
factors which significantly contributed to the reserve strengthening charges include rapidly rising medical costs  higher than anticipated claims utilization in certain markets  and development of prior years claim reserves 
to combat the adverse trends recognized in  management implemented various action plans including higher premium rate increases  accelerated repricing in certain targeted business segments  the exit from three underperforming markets  and the introduction of redesigned products with the conversion of older group health plans into these new benefit designs 
in response to the increased pharmacy costs and utilization  the company has introduced a two tiered drug copay plan 
also  in late december  the company entered into a new agreement with its prescription benefit manager which is expected to provide cost and efficiency benefits 
management has also initiated new administrative programs designed to reduce claim costs 
the benefits expected from the implementation of these programs should begin to materialize in and reduce the health loss ratio 
during the third quarter of  the company announced plans to cease marketing and terminate existing small group business in florida and all remaining business in maryland and minnesota over a period of months 
this decision was made after it became clear to management that certain regulatory challenges existed which made it impossible to return these markets to profitability 
management of the company made a considerable effort to work with state regulators on a reasonable resolution which entailed necessary rate increases 
upon notification from the state regulators that the company was denied the rate increases considered necessary  management reevaluated the assumptions used for this grouping of markets and found it necessary to record a premium deficiency reserve 
insurance contracts are grouped as relating to highly regulated markets and all other markets 
highly regulated markets include exited and other markets 
these markets are identified based on significant rating restrictions  states general legislative and regulatory environments  and the company s ability to effectively underwrite risk 
the company recorded a million after tax charge for a premium deficiency reserve to recognize expected losses related to highly regulated markets 
although management is disappointed with the turn of events in  the combined effect of the unfavorable developments is considered a short term setback for the company principally affecting management remains confident in the underlying earnings potential of the company and has implemented action plans  described above  which should contribute to improved financial performance starting in early while the company faced challenges with its small group health products  its ancillary products were profitable 
the medone product  combined with the company s group dental  group life  and self funded products combined to produce net income of million in the expense ratio for the company s health segment improved in compared to due mainly to management s commitment to increase operating efficiencies 
the company s low cost infrastructure and superior operating efficiencies provide flexibility and opportunities for targeted acquisitions and continued growth through new sales 
the company s balance sheet remains strong with a book value per share of as of december  and a tangible book value per share of 
in addition  the company reported positive cash flows from operations for of million 
the company s medical membership inforce of  at the end of was down slightly compared to  at the end of the prior year 
membership in the three states that the company is exiting totaled  at december  the effect of the implemented premium rate increases and exited states is expected to result in decreased membership in comparison of results of continuing operations the company experienced unrelated non recurring items in each of the three years in the period ended december  management believes that these non recurring items are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the company and has chosen to discuss their effects separately 
the following table illustrates the effect of non recurring items on the company s results year ended december  in thousands income loss from continuing operations before interest on debt assumed by newco uws and non recurring items    interest on debt assumed by newco uws  net of tax   non recurring items  net of tax    income loss from continuing operations    a summary description of each of the non recurring items is as follows in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired from pan american most of the health insurance business which is marketed to individuals and small employer groups

as a result  the company recorded an after tax charge of million to write off the intangible asset and other related costs 
as more fully described in summary of results  the company recorded a million after tax charge for a premium deficiency reserve in the third quarter of to recognize expected losses related to highly regulated markets 
years ended december  and the company reported a net loss of million or per share for  compared to an after tax loss from continuing operations of million or per share for excluding non recurring charges and excluding interest on debt assumed by newco uws  the company reported a loss of million or per share for  compared to income of million or per share for the decline in income from to is primarily the result of a higher loss ratio and lower investment gains  partially offset by a lower expense ratio and lower amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets

the health loss ratio  excluding non recurring items  was for  compared to for the increase in the health loss ratio is due to reserve strengthening charges recorded in and adverse medical cost trends as discussed previously in greater detail 
the company reported a health loss ratio of in the fourth quarter of management believes the impact of its actions will continue to have a positive impact on the health loss ratio in the life loss ratio increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the life loss ratio tends to fluctuate from period to period 
the company experienced higher than usual life claims experience during certain months in  which caused the year end life loss ratio to be above historical trends

the expense ratio for health products was for  an improvement from the prior year expense ratio of 
the administrative expense ratio decreased in as a result of successfully leveraging the company s expenses over a larger premium base 
management believes the health expense ratio will increase slightly in due to the implementation of certain administrative initiatives 
management believes the cost of these initiatives will be more than offset by reduced claim costs 
the health commission expense ratio increased slightly from as a result of growth in new business 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in  excluding interest on the million debt assumed by newco uws in conjunction with the spin off 
in july  the company refinanced its debt replacing its subordinated notes with a bank line of credit at a lower interest rate  which accounts for the decrease in interest expense from to amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets declined significantly in to million from million in the decrease was caused by the write off of the company s distribution system intangible asset as previously discussed

positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of medical and other benefits and other operating expenses 
the company s investment policies are designed to maximize yield  preserve principal and provide liquidity to meet anticipated payment obligations 
the company s cash flows from operations were positive at million for  and negative at million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
positive cash flows from operations in are principally the result of a leveling of the claims inventory  growth in membership and lower debt service costs as a result of the assumption of million in debt by newco uws in september cash flows from operations were negative in and  due mainly to a decline in business and a reduction in the inventory of claims pending adjudication 
management believes that cash flows for will be positive but may decline from due to an expected decline in business in force 
the company s insurance subsidiaries operate in states that require certain levels of regulatory capital and surplus and may restrict dividends to their parent companies 
based upon the financial statements of the company s insurance subsidiaries as of december   as filed with the insurance regulators  no dividends may be paid by these subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted risk based capital rbc standards for life and health insurers designed to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to various business risks faced by such insurers 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
at december   the company s principal insurance company subsidiaries had an rbc ratio that was substantially above the levels which would require regulatory action 
on july   the company entered into a five year revolving bank line of credit with a maximum commitment of million 
during  the company borrowed million on the bank line of credit to retire its subordinated notes outstanding 
effective november   the company entered into an agreement to amend the line of credit to reduce the maximum commitment from million to million

the maximum commitment will be further reduced to million on july  the stock of american medical security holdings  inc and united wisconsin life insurance company  subsidiaries of the company  has been pledged as collateral for the loan 
the line of credit contains certain covenants which  among other matters  require the company to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and restricts the company s ability to incur additional debt  pay future cash dividends and transfer assets 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  during  the company s board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
the company purchased million shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million 
as the majority of the shares were purchased in the fourth quarter of  the share repurchase program did not have a material impact on the earnings loss per share computation for the year ended december  in addition to internally generated funds and periodic borrowings on its existing bank line of credit  the company believes that additional financing could be obtained as market conditions may permit or dictate 
the company does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and intends to employ its earnings in the continued development of its business 
the company s future dividend policy will depend on its earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the board of directors 
market risk exposure the primary investment objective of the company is to maximize investment income while controlling risks and preserving principal 
the company seeks to meet this investment objective through diversity of coupon rates  liquidity  investment type  industry  issuer and geographic location 
the investment portfolio of the company consists primarily of investment grade debt securities 
the company uses outside investment managers who seek to maximize return on the portfolio within the company s investment guidelines 
at december   million or of the company s total investment portfolio was invested in debt securities 
the bond portfolio had an average quality rating of aa at december   and a at december   as measured by moody s investor service 
almost the entire portfolio was classified as available for sale 
the company had no investment mortgage loans  non publicly traded securities except for principal only strips of us government securities  real estate held for investment or financial derivatives 
the amortized cost of the total investment portfolio exceeded market value by million at december  management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient for its cash flow needs and that liquidation of its investment portfolio will not be necessary 
the primary market risk affecting the company is interest rate risk 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical decline in fair value of shareholders equity is estimated to be million after tax at december  this amount represents approximately of the company s shareholders equity 
at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings under the line of credit facility approximated the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
inflation health care costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise at a rate that exceeds the consumer price index 
the company s cost control measures and premium rate increases are designed to reduce the adverse effect of medical cost inflation on its operations 
in addition  the company uses its underwriting and medical management capabilities to help control inflation in health care costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will fully offset the impact of inflation or that premium revenue increases will equal or exceed increasing health care costs 
year during and  the company devoted significant time and resources in the effort to prepare for the year initiative 
the year project focused on issues facing the company in three major areas software applications developed internally  software applications acquired from a third party that had been customized by the company  and software applications acquired from a third party that had not been customized by the company and those products and services provided to the company by third parties 
the company evaluated all of its major business processes and developed detailed business continuity and contingency plans designed to deal with identified worst case scenarios with the highest chance of occurring 
by the end of  the company had reached a state of readiness such that all significant applications were year compliant 
the company experienced no known significant year issues or disruptions during the first part of  and anticipates no future significant problems relating to the year issue 
while the company currently believes that the year project was a success and that future material operational problems are unlikely  there can be no guarantee that future year related issues will not arise 
given the uncertainties surrounding unlikely possible future events relating to the year issue  the company will continue to monitor its applications and business processes 
the cost of the year project was funded through operating cash flows and did not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
the company incurred total costs of million million in relating to the year project

the company does not anticipate significant future operating and capital expenditures related to the year project
