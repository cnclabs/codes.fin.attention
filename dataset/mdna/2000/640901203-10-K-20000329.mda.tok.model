gross profit increased  from  in to  in gross profit  as a percentage of revenue was for and for this was primarily because of the company s improved margins on the maine macwis support project over the maine macwis project

the company expects to continue and expand this practice prospectively as well as to pursue more time and material contracts than it has historically pursued 
time and materials contracts generally do not require performance bonds and almost always involve less risk to meet customer requirements 
the company has historically not received its first contract progress payments until approximately three to six months after contract award  which itself was as much as months after proposal preparation commences 
the company was therefore required to fund substantial costs well before the receipt of related income  including marketing and proposal costs and the cost of a performance bond 
prospectively  the company expects to tighten up this timetable  thereby reducing the requirement for additional working capital 
the company has funded its operations through cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  borrowings from venture partners  and private placements of equity securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in the years ended december    and respectively 
fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily the result of changes in net income  accounts receivable and income tax receivable  accounts payable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts due to differences in contract milestones and payment dates

the bdc loan carries an annual interest rate of  and an annual deferred fee of  and must be paid back over five years 
both term loans are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the bdc was also issued five year warrants to purchase  unregistered shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on september  the fair value of the warrants was estimated by the company to be  using the black scholes model and is being amortized ratably over the exercise period 
such amount is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
the bdc and sblfc notes contain restrictive covenants  which require  among other things  a minimum cash flow to debt service coverage ratio 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with such covenant 
the company has obtained a waiver relating to this default as it pertains to the financial statements 
on november   the company entered into a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank 
this million revolving line of credit is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the company can borrow up to of certain qualified accounts receivable at an interest rate of prime plus 
on december   the revolving line of credit had an outstanding balance of zero 
the company believes that cash flow generated by operations will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through the end of the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations to date 
recently issued financial accounting standards there are no recently issued financial accounting standards that impact the company s financial statements 
factors that may affect future results labor considerations due to the technical and labor intensive nature of the company s business  continued success of the company depends largely upon the ability of management to attract and retain highly skilled information technology professionals and project managers possessing the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver the company s services 
there is a high demand for qualified information technology professionals worldwide and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
the company has no assurance that qualified information technology professionals will continue to be available in sufficient numbers  or at wages  which will enable the company to retain current or future employees 
a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition would be expected if the company fails to attract or retain qualified information technology professionals in sufficient numbers 
technological considerations rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changing client preferences and new product introductions characterizes the information technology industry 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop technological solutions that keep pace with changes in the industry 
there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s services noncompetitive or obsolete or that the company will be able to keep pace with the expected continued rapid changes in technology 
a failure by the company to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year client considerations the company s contracts  including year projects  often involve projects that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to measure 
there can be no assurance that despite the company s attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from errors  mistakes  omissions or negligent acts in rendering its services  these attempts will be successful 
the company s inability to meet a client s expectations in the delivery of its services could result in a material adverse effect to the client s operations and  therefore  could potentially give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation  detrimentally affecting its business  operating results and financial condition 
the company believes that it has successfully completed all client year projects and as of the date of this filing is not aware of any issues relating year projects undertaken by the company on behalf of clients 
long term contract concerns the typical contract with a client is for a term of one to three years 
generally  there is no assurance that a client will renew its contract when it terminates 
under such contracts  clients may reduce the use of the company s services without penalty 
failure by the company to retain its existing clients could materially adversely effect its results of operations
