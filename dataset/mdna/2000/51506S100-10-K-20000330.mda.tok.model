a conversion of a license agreement is  in effect  a migration from either a site or cpu license to a mips millions of instructions per second or msu measured service units license 
a site or cpu license allows the customer to use the licensed software only in one designated location 
a mips or msu license  however  allows the customer to use the licensed software in a multi site environment these licenses are often selected by customers who can reasonably anticipate their computing capacity needs  and this license is priced in proportion to the computing capacity of the machine 
if a customer elects to convert to a mips or msu license  the customer is required to pay the company an additional fee whenever the customer increases the size of their computing environment

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
the company is required to adopt sfas for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
because the company currently holds no derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas and does not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of sfas is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab to provide guidance regarding the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of sab year compliance through the first two months of  landmark s operations are fully functioning with no material year issues to report anywhere in the world 
at landmark corporate headquarters and at its subsidiary sites worldwide there have not been any significant year related issue that would affect the company s ability to manufacture  ship  sell or service its products 
in preparation for the year date rollover  the company conducted periodic evaluations of its computer systems and products in an effort to determine the actions  if any  necessary to make them year compliant 
the term year compliant or similar terms generally means that information technology hardware and software are able to correctly interpret and manipulate dates up to and through the year  without interruption as the result of the change to this date 
these evaluations involved both testing the company s computer systems and either requesting certifications from its vendors or consulting vendor websites 
the company completed testing and received vendor certification of all of its business critical information technology systems  including internal communication systems  accounting and finance systems  customer service systems and sales and marketing tracking systems  and does not anticipate any year compliance issues with these systems 
at the conclusion of testing these systems  the company determined that all critical information technology systems are year compliant 
the company upgraded  replaced and tested these applications  and this process was completed prior to the year date rollover 
the company also recognized that there are risks with respect to embedded systems that are not necessarily a part of the company s information technology systems but contain microprocessor chips  which may not function properly with the change of date to the year the majority of the embedded systems on which the company relies in its day to day operations are owned and managed by the lessors of the buildings in which the company s offices are located  or by agents of such lessors 
during the second quarter of  the company moved its headquarters to a new facility  containing new mechanical systems  in reston  virginia 
the company believed that the new mechanical systems will be year compliant  based on its building construction manager s experience with other such systems  and certain representations made by the manufacturers of such systems 
the company received assurance  through the representations in the equipment manufacturers operation and maintenance o m manuals or written letters of certification  that these systems are year compliant 
additionally  the company installed a new telephone switch in the new facility  and a year compliancy certificate has been received from the switch s manufacturer 
because the company believed that its information technology and embedded systems would be substantially year compliant in advance of the year date change  the company had no contingency plan to address non compliance 
the company  however  constantly monitors its year status and is prepared to develop contingency plans if it is determined that any business critical systems may not be year compliant 
disruptions with respect to the computer systems of vendors or customers  which are outside the control of the company  could impair the ability of the company to obtain services from or conduct business with its customers 
the company believes that its primary exposure is with respect to public utilities and telecommunications service providers 
the company completed the process of either consulting vendor websites or requesting certifications from these public utilities and telecommunications service providers of their year compliance 
although the public utility companies and telecommunications service providers consulted have determined to the best of their knowledge and belief that interruptions to services will be unlikely  unforeseen disruptions of the company s utilities or telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that no other providers are material to its business 
disruptions of customers computer systems could interfere with payments to the company by such customers  and therefore with the company s ability to make timely payments on its accounts  and could otherwise cause disruptions to the company s operations 
none of the company s customers  however  is individually material to the company s business and the company did not seek certifications from its customers that their internal computer systems are year compliant 
with respect to the products sold by the company  the company had determined that  with certain exceptions described below  to the extent that underlying hardware platforms  operating systems applications and databases will accommodate the year date change  the company s performance management software products are year compliant 
the company is specifically aware that cics version  release  an operating system developed and marketed by the ibm corporation is not presently year compliant  according to ibm  and that the company s the monitor for cics mvs version product  since it operates with such non compliant ibm product  is therefore also non compliant 
ibm has decided not to make their product compliant 
accordingly  the company has been communicating this non compliancy situation to its customers by written  oral and electronic e mail and the company s web site communications since the expected reduced sales of this product are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the other exceptions to the company s general condition of year product compliance are some company product customers may be operating older  non compliant versions of certain of the company s products  and also may not be active participants in product maintenance programs that periodically provide in the normal course of business at no additional charge beyond the on going costs of program participation newer product versions or product modifications that address year non compliancy issues and specifically make such products year compliant the older product scenario  the company discovered in the first quarter of that its navigraph product  version required a product addition to make it year compliant the navigraph scenario  the company discovered in the second quarter of that its smartagent for oracle product required a product addition to make it year compliant the smartagent for oracle scenario  and the company discovered in third quarter of that two products  navigraph version the navigraph scenario and the monitor for vtam version the monitor for vtam scenario have year data reporting and display defects which do not affect the overall operation of the product 
with respect to the older product scenario  the majority on an absolute basis of the company s products were made year compliant during certain other company products  specifically the monitor for db control  the monitor for mq series and naviplex products  were made year compliant during additionally  those customers on active product maintenance programs and approximately to of the company s customers participate in such programs receive regular product upgrades or modifications that include software that addresses year compliancy issues 
the company encourages all its customers to participate in active maintenance programs 
the company has completed its attempts to communicate this older product scenario issue to customers through written  oral and electronic e mail and the company s web site communications 
with respect to the navigraph scenario  the product addition required to make this product year compliant was made generally available to all navigraph customers participating in active maintenance programs during late april the company had previously communicated to its customers and to third parties  beginning in  that navigraph was year compliant 
the company has completed its efforts to contact all navigraph product customers to alert them that year compliancy issues may be present and to inform them of their options 
with respect to the smartagent for oracle scenario  the product addition required to make this product year compliant was made generally available to all smartagent for oracle customers participating in active maintenance programs during early august the company had previously communicated to its customers and to third parties  beginning in  that smartagent for oracle was year compliant 
year product additions have been made available for all versions x  x  and of smartagent for oracle 
smartagent for oracle becomes year compliant when used in conjunction with service pack  which was made available in early august year product additions replacement binaries for all previous versions x  x have been made available to smartagent for oracle customers that are on  or wish to join  active maintenance programs 
the company has completed its efforts to contact all smartagent for oracle product customers to alert them that year compliancy issues may be present and to inform them of their options 
with respect to the navigraph scenario  the product addition required to correct the reporting and display function defect and make this product fully year compliant was made generally available to all navigraph customers participating in active maintenance programs through the november performanceworks for mvs and os version cumulative service tape in november the company had communicated to its customers and to third parties through the second quarter of that navigraph was year compliant 
all navigraph version domestic customers participate in the maintenance program for the product 
approximately three quarters of international navigraph customers version and previous versions participate in the maintenance program for the products 
the company does not know how many of those international navigraph product customers not participating in an active maintenance program are no longer using the product 
accordingly  the majority of domestic and international navigraph customers who have elected to participate in active maintenance programs are  or will be made  year compliant with respect to such products in the normal course of business  assuming they accept and implement the november cumulative service tape as such normal product maintenance 
the company has completed its efforts to contact all navigraph product customers to alert them that year compliancy issues may be present and to inform them of their options 
with respect to the monitor for vtam scenario  the product addition required to make this product year compliant was made generally available to all monitor for vtam customers participating in active maintenance programs during november the company had previously communicated to its customers and to third parties that the monitor for vtam version was year compliant 
of the approximately domestic monitor for vtam customers  of such customers participate in the maintenance program for the product 
the company does not know how many of those domestic monitor for vtam customers not participating in an active maintenance program are no longer using the product 
of the approximately international monitor for vtam version and previous versions customers  approximately of such customers participate in the maintenance program for the products 
the company does not know how many of those international monitor for vtam version and previous versions customers not participating in an active maintenance program are no longer using the product 
accordingly  the majority of domestic and international monitor for vtam version customers who have elected to participate in active maintenance programs are  or will be made  year compliant with respect to such products  assuming they accept and implement the fix 
the company has completed is efforts to contact all monitor for vtam product customers to alert them that year compliancy issues may be present and to inform them of their options 
although the company did not anticipate that customers would require additional product support during the year date change  landmark had expanded support supplemented by additional on site staffing to assist customers on product maintenance with either year or non year related problems from thursday  december  through friday january  the number of year related calls from customers into the company s product support center has been much lower than anticipated 
customer support operations continue to report that customers have no significant year incidents 
notwithstanding its efforts to attempt to ensure that its products are year compliant and although the company to date has not experienced any significant problems associated with year  the company may experience future uncertainties and problems relating to the year date change issue  including but not limited to possible technical problems and or customer claims 
if circumstances warrant  the company may conduct additional tests for its mainframe and client server products  and is also aware that certain of its customers have been and will continue to conduct additional year company product compliancy tests 
it is possible that additional company product year compliancy issues could be discovered in the future during the course of such tests 
virtually all of the company s customers and potential customers were required to evaluate their information technology systems with respect to the year date change and the company believes that some of its customers and potential customers may have incurred material costs in connection with this evaluation and any necessary repairs and replacements 
customers and potential customers may have been required to devote material portions of their information technology budgets to such evaluations  repairs and replacements  which could have materially reduced their other information technology purchases in  including their purchases of the company s products  particularly as the year date change drew closer 
the company has very limited information as to the degree to which its customers or potential customers have completed year remediation efforts or whether or not its customers or potential customers are year compliant 
however  during the second  third  and fourth quarters of the company experienced a lengthening of the sales cycle due to  among other things  possible year issues 
the company anticipates that year related sales cycle lengthening may continue at least through the first quarter of the company has incurred a total of approximately million for years   and for year remediation activities 
there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the company with respect to its internal information technology systems  embedded systems or its products will eliminate the numerous and varied risks associated with the year date change 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by any year related difficulties encountered by vendors or customers or by any downturn in information technology purchases or in the economy in general as a result of the year date change 
additionally  the effects of any actual year non compliance problem directly or indirectly experienced by the company could be exacerbated by the fact that the company normally experiences its largest quarterly sales for a given calendar year in the fourth quarter of each year  and invoices and receives payment for such sales in the first quarter of the following calendar year 
accordingly  should a year non compliance problem or problems affect the company s customers  the potential impact on the company s operations could be greater than if the company received these payments at the time of sale or some time other than the calendar quarter immediately after the date switch from to any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany  france  the netherlands  sweden  spain  australia  hong kong and singapore that act as distributors of its products 
additionally  the company uses third party distributors to market and distribute its products in other international regions 
transactions conducted by the subsidiaries are typically denominated in the local country currency  while royalty payments from the distributors are typically denominated in us dollars 
as a result  the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and impact overall expected profitability 
through and as of december   the company s exposure was not material to the overall financial statements taken as a whole 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to unbilled accounts receivable 
at december   the company has million of unbilled accounts receivable  the estimated fair market value of these receivables is million 
if market interest rates increase from the levels at december   the fair market value of the unbilled accounts receivable would decline by an immaterial amount
