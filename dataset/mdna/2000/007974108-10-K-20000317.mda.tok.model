item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in advent s annual report to stockholders 
in addition  we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rates 
licenses into multi user networked environments have increased both in individual size and number  and the timing and size of individual license transactions are becoming increasingly important factors in quarterly operating results 
the sales cycles for transactions of this size are often lengthy and unpredictable 
we may not be successful in closing large license transactions such as these on a timely basis or at all 
accordingly  if future revenues from large site licenses constitute a material portion of our net revenues  the timing of such licenses could cause additional variability in our quarterly operating results 
we typically ship our software products shortly after receipt of a signed license agreement and initial payment and  consequently  software product backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenues and therefore are relatively fixed in the short term 
due to the fixed nature of these expenses combined with the relatively high gross margin historically achieved by us on products and services  an unanticipated decline in net revenues in any particular quarter is likely to disproportionately adversely affect operating results 
we have generally realized lower revenues from license fees in the first quarter of the year than in the last quarter of the prior year 
we believe that this has been due primarily to the concentration by some clients of larger capital purchases in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and their lower purchasing activity during the subsequent first quarter 
we believe our annual incentive compensation plans  which tend to produce increased year end sales activity  compound this factor 
furthermore  we have often recognized a substantial portion of each quarter s license revenues in the last month of that quarter 
because of the above factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in november like many companies in the technology and emerging growth sector  our stock price may be subject to wide fluctuations  particularly during times of high market volatility 
if net revenues or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  our stock price is likely to decline 
in addition  our stock price may be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
our sales cycle is long and we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
because the purchase of our software products often requires significant  executive level investment and systems architecture decisions by prospective customers  we must generally engage in a relatively lengthy sales effort 
these transactions may be delayed during the customer acceptance process because we must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefit of our products 
as a result  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our software products is typically between two and nine months depending upon the size of the client  though it can be considerably longer  and is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgeting constraints and internal acceptance procedures 
as a result of the length of our sales cycle  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales 
the timing of large individual sales is especially difficult to forecast 
because our expenses are generally relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues could result in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
the implementation of our solutions involves a significant commitment of resources by customers and by us over an extended period of time 
also  the size and complexity of any particular implementation project can cause delays in the sales cycle that precedes it 
any such delays could seriously harm our business 
we depend heavily on our product  axys 
in  and  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from the licensing of axys and related products and services 
in addition  many of our other products  such as moxy  qube and various data interfaces were designed to operate with axys to provide an integrated solution 
as a result  we believe that a majority of our net revenues  at least through  will depend upon continued market acceptance of axys  enhancements or upgrades to axys and related products and services 
we are continuing to expand our internet initiative 
to take advantage of the internet  we are continuing to expand an internet initiative under which we are developing services  both announced and unannounced  to bring internet based products and services to clients 
the first of these services  rex  was launched during the second quarter of the second service  advent browser reporting  was launched in the third quarter of as we develop new products and services under our internet initiative  we have and will continue to enter into development agreements with information providers  clients or other companies in order to accelerate the delivery of new products and services 
we may not be successful in marketing our internet services or in developing other internet services 
our failure to do so could seriously harm our business 
we expect our gross margin may fluctuate over time 
we also expect that our gross margins may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to introduce new recurring revenue products  expand our professional services organization and associated revenue  continue to hire additional personnel and increase other expenses to support our business 
we plan our expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels 
because these expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  a fluctuation in revenue could lead to operating results differing from expectations we must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to develop new products that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to these changing standards and practices 
delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of new products or enhancements may result in client dissatisfaction and delay or loss of product revenues 
in addition  our ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors  including system software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  database vendors and development tool vendors 
if the products of these vendors have design defects or flaws  or if these products are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction  our business could be seriously harmed 
we depend upon financial markets 
the target clients for our products include a range of organizations that manage investment portfolios  including investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks and hedge funds 
in addition  we target corporations  public funds  universities and non profit organizations  which also manage investment portfolios and have many of the same needs 
the success of many of our clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
we believe that demand for our products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the financial markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
general economic conditions may reduce our license revenues 
we believe that the market for large management software systems may be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including o reductions in capital expenditures by large customers  o poor performance of major financial markets  and o increasing competition 
the above factors may  in turn  give rise to a number of market trends that may slow license revenue growth across the industry  including o longer sales cycles  o deferral or delay of information technology projects and generally reduced expenditures for software  and o increased priced competition 
although we do not believe these factors have impacted our revenues to date  the continued presence of these factors in the market for large management software systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if our relationship with interactive data is terminated  our business may be harmed 
many of our clients use our proprietary interface to electronically retrieve pricing and other data from interactive data 
interactive data pays us a commission based on their revenues from providing this data to our clients 
our software products have been customized to be compatible with their system and this software would need to be redesigned if their services were unavailable for any reason 
termination of our agreement with interactive data would require at least two years notice by either us or them  or days in the case of material breach 
if our relationship with interactive data were terminated or their services were unavailable to our clients for any reason  replacing these services could be costly and time consuming 
we face intense competition 
the market for investment management software is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
our competitors include providers of software and related services as well as providers of timeshare services 
our competitors vary in size  scope of services offered and platforms supported 
in addition  we compete indirectly with existing and potential clients  many of whom develop their own software for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to license software products offered by independent vendors like us 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we do 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not result in price reductions  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we face challenges in expanding our international operations 
we market and sell our products in the united states and  to a lesser extent  internationally 
we have established a subsidiary located in australia to market and sell our products in australia 
in addition  during we entered into a distributor relationship with advent europe  an independent entity financially backed by our existing distributor in scandinavia 
in order to expand our international operations  we would need to continue to establish additional facilities  acquire other businesses or enter into additional distribution relationships in other parts of the world 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including o the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  o greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o difficulties in successfully adapting our products to the language and technology standards of other countries  o difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o political and economic instability 
our international revenues are generally denominated in us dollars  with the exception of our subsidiary  advent australia 
the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities of our subsidiary  advent australia  are primarily denominated in australian dollars 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities 
although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant  future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect revenues from international sales and the us dollar value of advent australia s revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
undetected software errors or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products that could seriously harm our business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or a delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property we may be subject to increased competition that could seriously harm our business 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
we cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent  if issued  would provide us with any competitive advantages or would not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not adversely affect our ability to do business 
litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology 
this litigation may be time consuming and expensive 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent that may be issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
we face risks associated with potential acquisitions or divestitures 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
in addition  we continually evaluate the performance of all our products and product lines and may sell or discontinue current products or product lines 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in integrating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt  write off software development costs or other assets  incur severance liabilities  amortize expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute our existing stockholders ownership 
in addition  potential acquisition candidates targeted by us may not have audited financial statements  detailed financial information or any degree of internal controls 
there can be no assurance that an audit subsequent to any successful completion of an acquisition will not reveal matters of significance  including issues regarding revenues  expenses  liabilities  contingent or otherwise  and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
we must attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical  sales and other personnel 
because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products  we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education  backgrounds and industry experience 
competition for qualified engineers  particularly in northern california and the san francisco bay area  is intense 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
much of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  since the formation of advent australia  pty 
ltd  advent australia whose revenues and capital spending are transacted in australian dollars we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
results of operations from advent australia are not material to our operating results  therefore  we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
however  a sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio
