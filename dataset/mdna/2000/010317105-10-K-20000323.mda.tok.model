income before the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in net income increased million during net interest income the largest component of the company s net income is its net interest income the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support its assets 
net interest income is determined by the yield earned on the company s earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the company s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates the following table depicts  on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods indicated  certain information related to the company s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields or costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities

during  the company experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or  to million  compared with million in net interest income increased despite a decrease in the net interest spread of basis points to in from in  and a decrease in the net interest margin of basis points to in  compared with in because the relative yield on loans exceeds that of all other earnings assets  the primary reason for the increased net interest income was a increase in average loan volume 
the slight decline in net interest spread and net interest margin is due to declining yields on average loans that exceeded the decline in cost of interest bearing liabilities  attributable to competition from banks and other financial institutions 
the company s average liabilities in included more interest bearing liabilities than in during  net average earning assets increased by million  or  to billion from billion in the major components of this increase included average loans which increased million  or  to billion in from billion in  and securities which increased million  or  to million in from million in analysis of changes in net interest income the following table sets forth  on a taxable equivalent basis  the effect which varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates had on changes in net interest income for and for the purposes of this table  changes which are not solely attributable to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate on a pro rata basis

the principal monitoring technique employed by the company is simulation analysis  which technique is augmented by gap analysis 
in sensitivity analysis  the company reviews each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments 
these projected behaviors are based upon management s past experiences and upon current competitive environments  including the various environments in the different markets in which the company competes 
using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs  the simulation analysis generates as output a projection of net interest income 
the company also periodically verifies the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models 
see market risk 
another technique used by the company in interest rate management is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
the company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing  and sources and prices of off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk 
the company uses computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios 
the modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time 
the following table illustrates the company s interest rate sensitivity at december   assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid  respectively  based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities 
interest sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands  except ratios december  after one after three within through through greater one three twelve within than one month months months one year year total assets earning assets loans       securities       trading securities    interest bearing deposits in other banks    funds sold    total interest earning assets       liabilities interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits     savings and money market deposits      time deposits       funds purchased    short term borrowings    long term debt   total interest bearing liabilities       period gap      cumulative gap       ratio of cumulative gap to total earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans of  excludes investment equity securities with a market value of  excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing 
includes treasury  tax and loan account of  the company generally benefits from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive 
the company is liability sensitive throughout one year after three months 
the analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
for this and other reasons  management relies more upon the simulation analysis as noted above in managing interest rate risk 
accordingly  management believes that a liability sensitive gap position is not as indicative of the company s true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk the company s earnings are dependent on its net interest income which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in its lending  investing and deposit gathering activities 
the company seeks to reduce its exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing its interest rate risk 
management relies upon static gap analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which quantifies  to a large extent  the degree of market risk inherent in the company s balance sheet 
gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates 
simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from basis points below to basis points above the current prevailing rates 
management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources 
with respect to the primary earning assets  loans and securities  certain features of individual types of loans and specific securities introduce uncertainty as to their expected performance at varying levels of interest rates 
in some cases  imbedded options exist whereby the borrower may elect to repay the obligation at any time 
these imbedded prepayment options make anticipating the performance of those instruments difficult given changes in prevailing rates 
at december   mortgage backed securities totaling million  or of total assets and essentially every underlying loan  net of unearned income  totaling billion  or of total assets  carry such imbedded options 
management believes that assumptions used in its simulation analysis about the performance of financial instruments with such imbedded options are appropriate 
however  the actual performance of these financial instruments may differ from management s estimates due to several factors  including the diversity and sophistication of the customer base  the general level of prevailing interest rates and the relationship to their historical levels  and general economic conditions 
the difference between those assumptions and actual results  if significant  could cause the actual results to differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
deposits totaled billion  or of total assets  at december  since deposits are the primary funding source for earning assets  the associated market risk is considered by management in its simulation analysis 
generally  it is anticipated that deposits will be sufficient to support funding requirements 
however  the rates paid for deposits at varying levels of prevailing interest rates have a significant impact on net interest income and therefore  must be quantified by the company in its simulation analysis 
specifically  the company s spread  the difference between the rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  is generally higher when prevailing rates are higher 
as prevailing rates reduce  the spread tends to compress  with severe compression at very low prevailing interest rates 
this characteristic is called spread compression and adversely effects net interest income in the simulation analysis when anticipated prevailing rates are reduced from current rates 
management relies upon historical experience to estimate the degree of spread compression in its simulation analysis 
management believes that such estimates of possible spread compression are reasonable 
however  if the degree of spread compression varies from that expected  the actual results could differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
the following table illustrates the results of simulation analysis used by the company to determine the extent to which market risk would have effected the net interest margin if prevailing interest rates differed from actual rates during because of the inherent use of estimates and assumptions in the simulation model used to derive this information  the actual results for and  certainly  the future impact of market risk on the company s net interest margin  may differ from that found in the table

on a monthly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
this review and analysis is based on the results of the internal monitoring and reporting system  analysis of economic conditions in its markets and a review of historical statistical data  current trends regarding the volume and severity of past due and problem loans and leases  the existence and effect of concentrations of credit  and changes in national and local economic conditions for both the company and other financial institutions 
management also considers in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses the results of regulatory examinations conducted for each bank  including evaluation of the company s policies and procedures and findings from the company s independent loan review department 
the provision for loan losses increased by  or  to million in from million in this increased provision reflected the company s large growth in loans during the growth in loans exceeded the growth in loan loss provision  primarily due to the company s low charge off experience and low nonperforming asset levels 
management believes the allowance for loan losses  at its current level  adequately covers the company s exposure to loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
while management believes that it has established the allowance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and has taken into account the views of its regulators and the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that in the future the company s regulators or its economic environment will not require further increases in the allowance 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are expensed as the provision for loan losses on the company s income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level as determined by management 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance for loan losses

accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
it is the company s policy to place a delinquent loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest which is accrued on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan losses 
during the years ending december   and  approximately   and  respectively  in additional interest income would have been recognized in earnings if the company s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms 
total nonperforming assets decreased  to million at december l   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses to period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  this ratio will generally fluctuate from period to period depending upon nonperforming asset levels at period end 
all categories of nonperforming assets decreased at year end compared with  with the largest decline being a  reduction in other real estate owned 
potential problem loans a potential problem loan is one that management has concerns as to the borrower s future performance under terms of the loan contract 
these loans are current as to principal and interest  and accordingly  they are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
management monitors these loans closely in order to ensure that the company s interests are protected 
at december   the company had certain loans considered by management to be potential problem loans totaling million 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income the company relies on five distinct product lines for the production of recurring noninterest income traditional retail and commercial banking  and operating segments including mortgage banking  trust services  investment services and insurance services 
combined fees associated with these product lines totaled million in  compared with million in  a decrease of  or

these factors were somewhat offset by reduced commission compensation in the some of the company s commission based businesses  such as mortgage origination and investment services  where revenue declined 
noninterest expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in data processing fees decreased  or  in to million  in part due to costs associated with conversion costs related to completed mergers during as well as operating efficiencies from consolidating such operations in legal and professional fees  million in  decreased  or  from million in as a result of costs associated with mergers completed during the company completed three mergers during and one during investment services the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the summary of operations for the investment services departments of the company investment services division amounts in thousands year ended december investment services revenue    other revenue    total investment revenue    expenses and allocated charges    net investment services revenue   national bank of commerce of birmingham nbc operates an investment department devoted primarily to handling correspondent banks investment needs

investment services revenues consist primarily of commission income from the sale of investment securities 
investment services revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease occurred in the fixed income division of nbc s investment services department  whose customers are primarily correspondent banks 
the rising interest rate environment in combined with strong loan demand in the economy reduced these investors demand for fixed income securities 
in addition  many of these customers elected to retain greater liquidity at year end in preparation for potential year liquidity needs  resulting in further reduced demand in the fourth quarter 
nbc securities experienced a million increase in its investment services revenue due to the addition of additional investment advisors as well as favorable market conditions 
the total of these two areas was a net decrease in investment services revenue  which decrease was partially offset by an increase in other revenue of million  or  to million in compared to million in this other revenue consists primarily of net interest income earned on margin loans at nbc securities but also includes interest and dividends on trading assets and fee based services including asset liability consulting  bond accounting and security safekeeping 
investment services revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily as a result of favorable market conditions 
these results include certain income and expense items that are allocated by management to the investment services areas of the company 
these results are not necessarily the same as would be expected if these activities were conducted by a stand alone entity because certain corporate overhead expenses are not allocated directly to this division

as interest rates rose in  mortgage origination volume declined 
the expenses and allocated charges increased by  to million in from million in the rise in expenses was largely due to expansion of the mortgage lending business into four new markets and the increased level of expenses associated with such expansion 
as the new mortgage lending branches acquire market share  management expects the profit margin in these areas will be comparable to that in existing markets served by the company 
fees charged in connection with the origination and resale of mortgage loans totaled million in and million in  an increase of million  or  resulting from a favorable interest rate environment  staff additions  and expansion of services into different geographic areas serviced by the company

earning assets loans loans are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
loans averaged billion in compared to billion in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans  net of unearned income  were billion compared to billion at the end of  an increase of million  or 
the growth in the company s loan portfolio is attributable to the company s ability to attract new customers while maintaining consistent underwriting standards and general economic conditions that resulted in increased loan demand from existing customers

in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in the company s market areas  and for the company in particular  to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
the principal component of the company s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at year end  this category totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to million  or  of the total loan portfolio  at year end residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  commercial mortgage loans increased million  or  to million at december  increases in both of these categories of loans are primarily the result of the company s expertise in and appetite for these commercial and residential real estate loans 
in addition  the general economic conditions in its markets  which generate such lending opportunities  are partially responsible for this growth 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared with million at december  the company s focus on the home construction market and strong construction activity in markets it serves caused this increase 
consumer loans decreased million  or  during to million from million in as a result of a continuation of a reduced emphasis on certain areas of consumer lending 
other categories of loans increased million  or to million during in part due to growth in margin lending in the investment services division  which loans are fully secured by marketable securities  and leases from the company s leasing division  which had its first full year of operations in as it was formed in late the company engages in no foreign lending operations 
the repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for the company 
the following table sets forth the company s loans maturing within specific intervals at december  loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates amounts in thousands december  over one year over one year through five five or less years years total commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate construction     real estate residential     real estate commercial     consumer     predetermined floating rates rates maturing after one year but within five years   maturing after five years   the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
securities securities  including securities classified as held to maturity or investment securities and available for sale  represent a significant portion of the company s earning assets 
securities averaged million during  compared with million during  an increase of million  or 
growth in the securities portfolio is generally a function of growth in funding sources net of lending opportunities 
at december   the securities portfolio totaled million  including securities held to maturity with an amortized cost of million and securities available for sale with a market value of million 
the following tables set forth the carrying value of securities held by the company at the dates indicated

at december   mortgage backed securities consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations totaled million 
these mortgage backed securities include million classified as investment securities and million classified as securities available for sale 
management expects the annual repayment of the underlying mortgages to vary as a result of monthly repayment of principal and or interest required under terms of the underlying promissory notes 
further  the actual rate of repayment is subject to changes depending upon both terms of the underlying mortgages and the relative level of mortgage interest rates 
when relative interest rates decline to levels below that of the underlying mortgages  acceleration of principal repayment is expected as some borrowers on the underlying mortgages refinance to lower rates 
when the underlying rates on mortgage loans are comparable to  or in excess of  market rates  repayment more closely conforms to scheduled amortization in accordance with terms of the promissory note 
accordingly  management generally expects repayment of the collateralized mortgage obligations in three to five years  and repayment of the pass through mortgage obligations in five to seven years 
other attributes of securities are discussed in interest sensitivity and market risk 
short term investments the company utilizes overnight investment of funds in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell to ensure that adequate liquidity will be maintained  while at the same time minimizing the level of uninvested cash reserves 
short term investments are also utilized by the company when the level of funds committed to lending and investment portfolio programs changes or the level of deposit generation changes 
during  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell averaged million  compared to million during  representing a million  or  decrease as the company experienced growth in both loans and investment securities 
trading account securities an important aspect of investment department operations  but less so to the company in total  are trading account securities  which represent securities owned by the company prior to sale and delivery to the company s customers 
trading account securities averaged million in and were million at december   compared with an average of million in and million at december  this small dollar amount reflects management s policy of limiting positions in such securities to reduce its exposure to market and interest rate changes 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in this increase is attributable to competitive rate and product offerings by the company and successful marketing efforts 
average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million  or  to million in  from million in due  in part  to additional liquidity provided by downstream correspondent banks 
average short term borrowings decreased by  or  to million in  compared to million in as some of the company s funding shifted from short term to long term 
average long term borrowings increased million to million in  from million in  as the company utilized more borrowing programs offered to its federal home loan bank member subsidiaries 
deposits average total deposits increased million  or  to billion during  from billion during at december   total deposits were billion  compared with billion at december   an increase of million  or 
the following table sets forth the deposits of the company by category at the dates indicated 
deposits amounts in thousands  except percentages december  percent percent percent percent percent amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total amount of total demand      now      savings and money market      time less than time greater than total deposits      core deposits  which exclude time deposits of  or more  provide for a relatively stable funding source that supports earning assets 
the company s core deposits totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december  and totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december deposits  in particular core deposits  have historically been the company s primary source of funding and have enabled the company to meet successfully both short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be the company s primary source of funding in the future 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of  and the ratio averaged during and during these increases in the company s loan to deposit ratio are due to loan growth exceeding deposit growth in the maturity distribution of the company s time deposits in excess of  at december   is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more amounts in thousands december  after after one six through after three through after within one three through six twelve twelve month months months months months total certificates of deposit of  or more       other time deposits of  or more       total       approximately of the company s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
many financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets with large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers  and the company had million in brokered deposits outstanding at december   compared to no such deposits at december  borrowed funds borrowed funds include four broad categories  i federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  ii treasury  tax and loan balances  iii federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  and iv borrowings from an third party bank 
because of a relatively high loan to deposit ratio  the existence and stability of these funding sources are critical to the company s maintenance of short term and long term liquidity 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent both an input of excess funds from correspondent bank customers of the company as well as a cash management tool offered to corporate customers 
at december   these funds totaled million  compared with million at december  at december  treasury  tax and loan balances totaled million  compared to million at december  the company collects tax deposits from customers and is permitted to retain these balances until established collateral limits are exceeded or until the us treasury withdraws its balances 
the company s average borrowing from an third party bank under a million credit facility the credit facility was million during  compared with million during as of december   the outstanding balance under the credit facility was million  leaving a remaining availability under the credit facility of million 
the credit facility bears interest at a rate that varies with libor and is secured by stock in the banks 
the credit facility is typically renewed on an annual basis and has a current maturity date of may  the company has historically renewed the credit facility prior to its due date and anticipates doing so again in all of the banks are members of the fhlb 
at december   these banks had available fhlb lines of million  under which million was outstanding  including advances classified as short term of million and advances classified as long term of million 
this compares to borrowings of million at december   of which million was short term and million was long term

under the capital guidelines of their regulators  the company and the banks are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier i capital 
tier i capital consists of common stockholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  under the guidelines  the company and the banks must maintain a minimum tier i leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is typically increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions 
the company exceeded its fully phased in regulatory capital ratios at december   and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents the ability of an entity to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  the company will not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
increased liquidity in typical interest rate environments often involves decreasing profits by investing in earning assets with shorter maturities 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
assets included in the company s consolidated statements of condition contribute to liquidity management 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  the company s primary source of liquidity  averaged million during and was million at december   and averaged million during and was million at december  if required in short term liquidity management  these assets could be converted to cash immediately 
cash received from the repayment of investment securities and loans provide a constant source of cash that contributes to liquidity management 
unpledged securities  with a carrying value of approximately million at december   provide the company an opportunity to generate cash by  providing additional collateral by selling securities under agreements to repurchase  providing collateral to obtain public funds or providing collateral to borrow directly from the federal reserve bank or the federal home loan bank 
see earning assets loans and earning assets securities 
liquidity can also be managed using liabilities included in the company s consolidated statement of condition  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short term borrowing 
combined federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan  and short term borrowings averaged million during and was million at december   and averaged million during and was million at december  overnight borrowing lines with upstream correspondent banks  million at december   of which million was unused  provide additional sources of liquidity to the company on an unsecured basis 
the federal home loan bank provides secured and unsecured credit lines to nine of the company s banks totaling approximately million 
at december   advances under these lines totaled million  including million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
long term liquidity needs are met through the company s deposit base approximately of the company s deposits at december   are considered core deposits  and the repayment of loans and other investments as they mature 
the company is able to manage its long term liquidity needs by adjusting the rates it pays on longer term deposits and the amount and mix of longer term investments in its portfolio 
one of the banks has pledged approximately million in loans to the federal reserve bank of atlanta as collateral for a discount window credit facility  which facility management views as a backup liquidity facility 
at december   the company had access to approximately million under this facility  with no outstanding borrowings 
the company  as a stand alone corporation  has more limited access to liquidity sources than its banks and depends on dividends from its subsidiaries as its primary source of liquidity 
the company s liquidity is diminished by required payments on its outstanding short term debt 
the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions which may  but are not expected to  have a material negative impact on the liquidity available to the company 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
if circumstances warrant  the company s short term liquidity needs can also be met by additional borrowings of approximately million representing the unused portion of the company s credit facility with an unrelated bank

accounting rule changes derivative investments and hedging activities in june  the fasb issued statement of financial standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  statement  effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  an entity may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedging instrument

mortgage backed securities in october   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 statement 
statement amends statement to require that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
this statement was adopted january  however  since the company does not historically securitize mortgage loans  there has been no financial statement impact since adopting this statement 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on the company s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation

industry developments certain recently enacted and proposed legislation could have an effect on both the costs of doing business and the competitive factors facing the financial institutions industry 
the company is unable at this time to assess the impact of this legislation on its financial condition or results of operations 
year technology considerations the company did not experience any material problems related to the year date change 
in addition  management is not aware of any customers that have experienced year issues that would have a material impact on the company  nor have any of the company s vendors experienced year problems that would impair its ability to provide services to the company 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change has not been fully recognized
