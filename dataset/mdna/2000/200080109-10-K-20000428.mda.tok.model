item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition o continuing operations the company s continuing operations consist of one business segment  wireless communications products and services 
the company provides test and measurement products and services for wireless telephone carriers  systems for the wireless transmission of voice and data  and advanced technology products for portable wireless appliances such as notebook computers  cellular telephones and personal organizers 
during the past six years  the company  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless  has invested more of its corporate resources in expanding this wireless communication business area 
the company is accelerating this investment in the wireless segment by divesting its legacy business area  information technology and staffing services  and concentrating exclusively in the wireless communications business area 
summarized financial information for the company s continuing operations for the years ended january    and is as follows years ended january  dollars in thousands revenues    operating income    identifiable assets    o wireless communications products and services the company s wireless communications products and services are in the marketplace which today involves the convergence of wireless voice and data  broadband and the internet 
wireless telecommunication networks use a variety of radio frequencies to transmit voice and data 
wireles telecommunication networks include two way radio applications  such as trunking radio  multiple access technologies such as cellular  pcs and iden networks  and messaging applications  such as paging services 
although cellular  pcs and iden represent the largest segment of the wireless communications industry  other wireless technologies are expected to grow significantly 
these technologies all require radio frequency engineering expertise for design and optimization 
the company s wireless communications products and services business  sold through its subsidiary  comarco wireless  is presently comprised of five product families wireless test and measurement  benchmarking and engineering information services  wireless revenue assurance information  wireless vertical applications and terminals  and mobile power products 
o the wireless test and measurement marketplace is covered by the lt product family used to monitor network performance  the x series family used to solve complex engineering problems  and the baseline tm family used to collect quality of service information 
these products provide a method for monitoring  analyzing  and benchmarking the performance of wireless system networks 
these products currently or in the future will address all major cellular technologies including cdma  tdma  gsm  iden and data 
o the company has also developed and deployed a large scale mobile testing network and is now providing this service nationally 
this testing is aimed at the collection and analysis of information related to the quality of service as experienced by wireless phone users  which is critical to wireless service providers  infrastructure vendors and other wireless industry participants 
o the wireless revenue assurance information marketplace is covered by rap tm central which automates data collection  analysis  and delivery of revenue assurance information for wireless service providers 
this system improves revenue capture by assisting carriers in billing for every minute of use 
o the wireless vertical applications and terminals marketplace is covered by a number of callbox products that provide emergency service over wire line and wireless backbones 
in addition to providing the callbox product  comarco wireless also provides project installation and long term maintenance services 
in october  the company purchased certain callbox product line assets from gte 
the installed base purchased from gte consists of over  units  of which approximate ly  are being serviced by the company under long term maintenance contracts 
in addition  in february  the company acquired certain assets of the cubic communications  inc callbox product line 
the installed base purchased from cubic communications consists of approximately  units 
management believes that the combination of these two acquired product lines establishes the company as a major vendor to this niche of the wireless vertical applications and terminals products marketplace 
o the mobile power products marketplace was addressed during the year with the company s introduction of a watt universal power adapter for cellular phones  laptop computers  personal assistants and other portable devices 
development continues on a watt universal power adapter which will meet the power needs of the pentium iii and equivalent chipsets currently available in high end portable computers 
the watt unit  with just a change in the company s patented tips  will be able to charge virtually all cellular telephones  laptop computers  personal assistants and other portable devices 
the company expects a rapid proliferation of portable and stationary computing and communications systems and appliances that are connected by wireless communication networks to the public internet  private intranets  private local area networks  servers and other terminal devices 
the company currently provides the above stated products and services for these markets  and the company is developing strategies and plans to provide additional products and services to end users and network operators 
based on its current strategy  the company forecasts that a growing percentage of its revenues and profit will come from services in the future 
continuing operations fiscal year revenues totaled million  representing an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal year totaled million compared with million a year ago 
reduced year to year operating income was affected by a major product transition to the new x series wireless test and measurement platform and increased engineering expenditures to build engineering and operations infrastructure needed to support expected growth in the company s wireless test and measurement products and services and next generation chargesource tm power adapter product line 
the first of the x series product family shipped in march cdma and will eventually support all multiple access technologies cdma  is  gsm  and iden 
continued growth in comarco wireless revenues and income is predicated on a number of factors  including the continued success of the company s product development efforts  continued geographical expansion to international markets  continued growth and increased availability of cellular and other wireless communications services  including pcs  in the united states and internationally  and continued acceptance of the company s products by its customers  none of which can be assured 
international revenues in fiscal year totaled million  down from million in the prior fiscal year 
international revenues in fiscal year totaled million 
year to year decreased international revenues are due to lower activity in asia due to the general economic conditions and lower activity in europe 
the majority of these sales have been made to europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a key area of growth  although the activity may continue to be weak in the near term 
marketing and post contract customer support offices are staffed in singapore  england  and mexico 
product development the company continues its product development program in its wireless communications business 
the company s core technologies are currently in three areas wireless network design antenna systems  rf propagation  coverage analysis  base station radio  network dynamics  optimization  switch operations  billing systems  wireless appliances interfaces cellular telephones  fixed cellular terminals  personal digital assistants  laptop computers  and wireless product design technologies digital signal processing  rf scanning receivers  cdma  is  gsm  iden  power conversion 
because a common thread of technology runs through all of its product lines  the company believes that it can leverage its investment and maintain the focus and concentration of its technical and marketing resources  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company in general has been developing and plans to continue developing products that will be compatible with all wireless communications air interfaces worldwide 
new product introductions this year included adding other air interfaces to the company s line of wireless test and measurement and rap tm central products including cdma  gsm  pc  is and iden  further expansion of the company s lt line and the baseline tm range of products which represent state of the art technology in comparative network analysis 
the baseline tm product also includes comarco wireless innovative q mos tm technology  which permits wireless carriers to assess the audio quality of their networks and compare it directly with that offered by competing carriers 
the company s wireless product life cycle is estimated to be two to five years  depending on the product 
the company is also continuing its development of a second generation power adapter for laptop computers  cellular telephones and other mobile power products 
the objective of this product is to be smaller  lighter and more versatile than existing products on the market and is based on the company s patented power conversion technology 
the company commenced sales of the first version of this product in late fiscal year  with a more powerful watt version currently under development 
potential customers are replacement market buyers and original equipment manufacturers 
the company s initial product was focused on replacement market buyers 
the power requirements of laptop computers are increasing due to the introduction of more powerful microprocessors and more advanced battery technologies 
this requires the company to continue its product development program to increase the power capacity of its power adapter products 
the company recently received preliminary approval of the power adapter from ul and is proceeding aggressively toward a watt product introduction within a few months 
introduction of this next generation product expands the available market coverage to include essentially all ibm  toshiba  compaq  dell  apple and other popular portable computers as well as all leading cell phones  palm and handheld computers  and portable printers 
there can be no assurance that the higher power adapter product will be successful 
the company is aware that the power supply market is extremely competitive 
if the company is successful  the production  marketing  and sale of this product will require a significant amount of working capital for the financing of inventory and accounts receivable arising from sales of the product 
the company plans to continue to invest substantially in product development efforts 
its products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing products in a timely and cost effective manner and to identify  develop  and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and standards and meet customer needs in the wireless communications marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to technological advances  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  and any significant delays in development  introduction or shipment of products  or achievement of acceptable product costs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company s wireless communications business capitalized approximately million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
of the amounts capitalized  million  million  and million  respectively  were amortized in fiscal years  and against product sales in accordance with sfas in addition  during fiscal years   and  comarco wireless had expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  for research and development expenses including company sponsored software development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility  for product design and development expenses  as well as design expenses associated with component replacements  reducing the cost  and improving the manufacturability of existing products 
the reduced fiscal year and research and development expenses are due to the transition of the universal power adapter development to initial production and market trial shipments during the year 
although the company performs extensive testing of its software prior to releasing its products  such products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first released 
these may not be discovered until the product has been used by customers in different application environments 
failure to discover product deficiencies or bugs could delay product introductions  require design modifications to previously shipped products  and negatively impact shipments  any of which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business 
backlog the company s orders for wireless communications products and services totaled million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  are approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance includes million of product and service orders for the wireless test and measurement  revenue assurance information  and mobile power product lines  and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
since the rollout of the company s large scale mobile testing network  two national wireless providers have contracted with the company for quality of service information services 
the company is in discussions with several additional potential customers and expects continued growth for its wireless test and measurement services 
management believes that substantially all of the products and services backlog amount of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s product orders are filled within months from receipt of the order 
the remaining unfilled orders of million are related to the wireless vertical applications and terminals product line 
this backlog balance consists of million of new product orders and million of long term maintenance agreements 
the company is well into the process of negotiating new multi year agreements for the maintenance and operation of the california installed base 
the first two contracts  worth approximately million  were negotiated and are part of the year end backlog in fiscal year additionally  since the end of fiscal year  the company has signed an upgrade contract and new maintenance and operation agreements with orange county  california that together are valued at approximately million 
in this wireless vertical applications and terminals area  the company also continues to invest heavily in a number of large opportunities such as the pennsylvania turnpike authority  and the states of texas  louisiana  florida  georgia  nevada  utah and colorado 
two customers each accounted for of total revenues  and one additional customer accounted for of revenues in fiscal year two of these customers revenues were higher in fiscal year due to one time major upgrade contracts for the los angeles county and the san francisco bay areas 
no one customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal years and seasonality fluctuation in quarterly results comarco wireless has experienced  in each of the past six years  a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the latter half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half of its fiscal year  although this trend has been declining over the same six years 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the deployment schedule of wireless network operators in both north american and international markets  which can be delayed by both economic and political issues  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  capacity and production constraints associated with single source component suppliers  and other competitive factors 
historically  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of any given quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
marketing  sales distribution  foreign sales comarco wireless maintains its own internal sales force for the marketing and sales of the company s product offerings in the united states 
in addition  the company has opened and staffed direct sales and customer support offices in singapore  england  and mexico to service asia pacific  europe  and latin america  respectively 
the international offices manage a network of agents and distributors for the coordination of sales activity outside of the united states 
this expansion overseas faces a number of inherent barriers  including the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade restrictions  changes in laws governing the imposition of duties  quotas  taxes  or other charges relating to the import or export of its products  political and economic instability  the difficulty of administering business globally  longer accounts receivable cycles  and currency exchange fluctuations 
the company currently has limited experience in penetrating the foreign marketplace and  therefore  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have a competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s international sales efforts will be successful 
the company currently sells to its major customers under purchase orders that are usually placed with short term delivery requirements 
therefore  the company maintains significant inventory levels and associated production and technical staff in order to respond to the short term delivery requirements 
if the customer orders  as forecasted  do not materialize or are delayed  the company will have higher levels of inventory than otherwise needed  increasing the risk of obsolescence 
the higher levels of inventory and production and technical staffing would also reduce the company s liquidity and profitability 
the company s target marketplace for chargesource tm  its patented universal ac power adapter and recharger  includes direct to original equipment manufacturers  distribution to retail and corporate customers  and e commerce  direct to customers 
distribution to retail and corporate customers is handled through an agreement with targus international using traditional purchase orders 
to reach the business traveler  the company recently began a direct marketing campaign through its website  chargesource 
com  and print ads 
the company s standard terms require foreign customers to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
as such  a strengthening of the us dollar as compared to a foreign customer s local currency effectively increases the cost of the company s products for that customer  thereby making the company s products less attractive to that customer 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  the company may limit its exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
such activity to date has been insignificant 
there can be no assurance that a currency hedging strategy will be successful in avoiding exchange related losses in the future 
significant weakness in foreign currency exchange rates can also create economic uncertainty  including weakness in banking systems and equity markets 
such weaknesses can impact customers demand for the company s products and their ability to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
therefore  any significant change in a foreign country s exchange rates  economy  or a deterioration of us trade relations or the economies or political stability of foreign locations in which the company sells its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company has received its iso certification  a uniform worldwide quality control standard  on its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in irvine  california 
customers and potential customers throughout the world  particularly in europe  may require that their suppliers be iso certified 
in addition  some customers may require that their suppliers purchase components only from subcontractors that are iso certified 
therefore  the company s current status removes a potential barrier to its ability to successfully compete in the international marketplace 
service and warranty the company s warranties vary by product type and typically cover defects in materials and workmanship 
warranty obligations and other maintenance services for the company s products are primarily performed by the company at its facilities in california 
the company currently has service employees located in singapore  england  and mexico to service their respective geographical regions 
capital requirements comarco wireless working capital needs primarily consist of the cost of the upfront product development effort required to expand the company s product offerings  inventory requirements including long lead time materials  and the financing of accounts receivable  which will generally become longer upon the company s continued planned geographical expansion into europe  asia pacific and latin america 
certain components used by the company in its existing products are only available from single sources  and certain other components are presently available or acquired only from a limited number of suppliers 
the radio interface devices designed into the company s products are key purchased components whose lack of availability could have a material adverse impact on sales and profits 
in the event that any of its single source suppliers are unable to fulfill company requirements or discontinue the manufacture of a key component  the company would be required to purchase a comparable component from other sources and modify its products to function properly with the replacement component or redesign its products to use other components  either of which could result in delays in production and delivery 
working capital requirements are expected to be financed from operations and the financial resources of the company 
comarco wireless also operates from a single site manufacturing operation 
any material disruption in the manufacturing operations of comarco wireless  whether due to fire  natural disasters  or otherwise  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
technical requirements comarco wireless is selling its products into a market that is growing rapidly and subject to technological obsolescence 
market timing of product introductions is critical for success 
in the development of new or expanded product offerings  the company s access to the technical design of air interface devices is essential for the company to anticipate and develop compatible wireless communications products 
the inability to obtain the technical designs on a timely basis will have a direct impact on product design and schedule and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
employees as of april   comarco wireless employed approximately employees 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the contribution of its executive officers and other key employees 
no executive officer or key employees have employment agreements 
recognizing this reality  the company has instituted a non qualified stock option plan for key comarco wireless employees  whereby they will directly participate in the success of comarco wireless see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company obtains its employees through a variety of means including advertisements  technical job fairs  engineering recruiters  and engineering temporary staffing firms 
competition comarco wireless competes in niches of the wireless communications marketplace wireless test and measurement products and services  wireless revenue assurance information products and services  wireless vertical applications and terminals  and mobile power products 
the business is competitive and there are other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources  which provide or could provide the same type of products 
competitors include wireless test and measurement products and services ericsson  allen telecom  ascom  agilent  tektronix  lcc international  wfi  decide 
com  metapath systems international  wireless revenue assurance information products and services  metapath systems international  pwc  andersen consulting  ttc  wireless vertical applications and terminals  alcatel  siemens  telefonica de espana  gaitronics  and mobile power products motorola  ericsson  nokia  aztec  delta 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the rate at which customers accept the company s products in domestic and international markets  product quality and performance  experienced sales and marketing personnel  rapid development of new products and features  evolving industry standards  and the number and nature of the company s competitors 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products and services are competitive  reduction in the price of the company s products or services without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and operating costs would negatively affect operating margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company also derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of product upgrades to its installed base 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrade sales 
the company believes there are companies that provide or have the ability to provide the products the company is planning for overseas users 
also  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage in penetrating those markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future  either domestically or internationally 
proprietary information the company has three patents for its small power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones  and patents covering its emergency roadside callbox product 
however  the company currently relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect its intellectual property in the wireless communications products area 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede third party development of its technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
stock market fluctuation in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earnings estimates  the announcements of new products  product enhancements or services by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
o discontinued operations in july  the company announced that it was embarking on a plan to strengthen the company s focus on the wireless communications products and services business segment 
this plan  which was formalized at the end of the quarter ended october   involves selling the company s information technology and staffing services product lines 
therefore  this segment is reflected as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
these services are primarily in the fields of o information technologies o intelligent instrumentation and automated test systems o ordnance and weapon systems engineering services o airport management services o commercial staffing services o manufacturing training as of april   the company has closed three out of six currently planned divestiture transactions 
the aggregate consideration received to date is million 
the remaining transactions are in varying stages of completion 
the company does not expect to realize a loss on the sale of the discontinued segment  however at this time  management cannot determine the amount of gain that may result from the sale 
during fiscal year  discontinued operations revenues were million with a net after tax loss of  the net after tax loss is due to the recording of a final pre tax million loss to terminate two fixed price contracts with a single government agency and an additional pre tax loss of million related to a change in management s estimate to complete a multi year fixed price contract after completion of protracted negotiations with the us air force over the company s request for equitable adjustment 
the negotiation resulted in additional funding of million and a month contract extension 
this modified contract now ends in march information technologies the company specializes in the application of information technologies to support agencies of the us department of defense  other federal government agencies  local governments  and various commercial customers

specializing in both manual and automated electronics interconnection methods  the company offers certification and operator training in accordance with the commercial standard  ipc a this business has been sold subsequent to the year ended january  backlog the company s backlog from information technology and staffing services revenue believed to be firm as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  the source of backlog is primarily contracts with the us and local governments 
government contracts normally have base and option periods totaling three to five years in duration 
in many instances  government entities must issue work orders  delivery orders  or task orders prior to the company commencing work 
these entities have the discretion to terminate any contract at their convenience  and are normally obligated only to pay for costs incurred to date under a contract 
in addition  these entities may elect to remove funding previously attached to a contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year  with options to provide services for additional periods of time 
there can be no assurances that government entities will exercise the options  will not withdraw funds already committed  or that the entities will fund the unfunded portions of the company s contracts 
it is estimated that approximately of the firm backlog will be realized in fiscal year government contracts a significant portion of the company s total revenues from continuing and discontinued operations approximately in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year was derived from contracts with the united states government  principally agencies of the department of defense 
significant portions of the company s fiscal year revenues were derived from contracts with the us military services department of defense   us army   us navy   and us air force  
should changes in procurement policies or reductions in government expenditures occur  revenue and net income of the company could be adversely affected see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s government contracts business is not seasonal  however variations may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
further  the federal government is increasing its use of general services administration multiple award schedules gsa mas and other very broad based contract vehicles to acquire information technology related services 
the company has responded to this shift in its federal government market by successfully obtaining awards of its own gsa mas in february and teaming with other companies on similar vehicles they have obtained 
in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
in march  the company announced the award of a five year government contract three year base period with two one year options with an estimated value of million to continue to provide engineering and management services to the us navy at crane  indiana 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
the company s airport management services contract at reagan washington national airport ended on september  the company decided not to pursue the recompete of this contract since it was marginally profitable  and it would have been unprofitable if reawarded to the company 
the company plans to aggressively compete for its existing work and selectively pursue other high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded work under any future proposals 
competition approximately of the company s information technology and staffing services business is awarded through competitive procurements 
government contracting services industries consist of thousands of companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company  who can provide the same type of services 
the business is highly competitive 
the company obtains much of its business on the basis of submitted proposals to new and existing customers 
competition generally centers on price  past performance  technical capability  management plan  and personnel 
there is no single company that competes directly with the company on all of the company s services and products 
proprietary information the united states government has certain proprietary rights in software programs and products developed by the company in its performance of government contracts 
seasonality the company s information technology and staffing services business in general is not seasonal  although the summer and winter holiday seasons affect revenues of the company because of their impact on the company s labor sales 
variations in the company s business may also occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
employees as of april   the company employed approximately full time employees  of which were part of the information technology and staffing services business area 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
item properties the company s principal facilities on january   aggregating approximately  square feet  are located in the cities of irvine  santa ana  camarillo  victorville  corona and ridgecrest  california  vienna and petersburg  virginia  sierra vista  arizona  warner robins  georgia  bloomfield  indiana  colorado springs  colorado  huntsville  alabama  germantown  maryland  london  england  and singapore  and are occupied under leases expiring prior to fiscal year the facilities in irvine  california  london  england  and singapore relate to the continuing operations of the company 
with the exception of an  square foot area used for light manufacturing  all facilities are used for office space 
the company s aggregate annual property rent during fiscal year was approximately million 
the aggregate annual property rent in the year ending january  is expected to be approximately million 
management believes that all facilities currently occupied by the company provide sufficient space for the company s present needs  and that suitable additional space will be available  if needed

in july  the company announced that it was embarking on a plan to strengthen the company s focus on the wireless communications products and services business area 
this plan  which was formalized at the end of the quarter ended october   involves selling the company s information technology and staffing services product lines 
therefore  this segment is presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
as of april   the company has closed three out of six currently planned divestiture transactions 
the aggregate consideration received to date is million 
the remaining transactions are in varying stages of completion 
the company does not expect to realize a loss on the sale of the discontinued segment  however at this time  management cannot determine the amount of gain that may result from the sale 
at the conclusion of the divestiture process  the company will consist of the parent company  comarco wireless  and its wholly owned subsidiary  comarco wireless international  inc the company is operating in one business segment  wireless communication products and services 
results of continuing operations fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal year revenues from continuing operations totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to the company s completion of a number of wireless terminals callbox upgrade contracts  shipments of the company s first generation universal power adapter and recharger  the initial rollout of the company s wireless test and measurement mobile testing services during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  along with a reduction in the sale of wireless test and measurement products to major cellular carriers  chiefly in the fourth quarter 
this reduction in the sales of wireless test and measurement products was due to a major product transition to the new x series test and measurement platform 
the first of the x series family was released in march the x platform will support all multiple access technologies cdma  is  gsm  and iden 
the company expects the level of sales activity for its wireless terminals callboxes will return to historical levels in fiscal year  while services revenues will increase significantly with the full rollout of its wireless test and measurement mobile testing services 
the company expects a rapid proliferation of portable and stationary computing and communication systems and appliances that are connected by wireless communication networks to the public internet  private intranet  private local area networks  servers  and other terminal devices 
the company provides products and services for these markets and with its core technologies consisting of wireless network design  wireless appliance interfaces and wireless design technologies  plans to provide additional products and services to end users and network operators 
based on this current strategy  the company forecasts that a growing percentage of its revenues and profit will come from services in the future 
gross profit from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal year compared with million in the prior year 
gross profit percentage of revenue was in fiscal year compared with in the prior year 
the decreased gross profit dollars and percentage between years is due to the lower margins the company realized on its increased sales of wireless terminals callboxes for the upgrade contracts for los angeles county  the san francisco bay and the sacramento areas of california  sales of its first generation universal power adapters and rechargers  and lower sales of its higher margin wireless test and measurement products 
indirect costs were million in fiscal years and during fiscal year  the company increased sustaining engineering  research and development and support expenditures by million to million to support expected growth in its wireless test and measurement products and services along with the product development of the second generation of the wireless accessory  a portable power adapter and recharger  chargesource tm 
the company expects this trend to continue as the company executes its current plan to develop additional products and services for the marketplace which is converging wireless voice and data  broadband and the internet 
selling and general and administrative costs declined million to million  primarily due to a reduction in international selling expenses in response to softness in the international marketplace due to the well publicized effects of the economic and currency problems experienced by a number of international markets over the past eighteen months 
the company expects revenues and contribution from international markets to gradually increase 
operating income from continuing operations decreased to million  from million in the prior year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the year to year decrease in operating income percentage is primarily due to lower gross profit contribution from the increased sales of wireless terminals callbox and wireless accessory universal power adapter product lines  as discussed above 
the company is continuing its software product development program in its continuing operation s wireless communications products business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  in fiscal year these amounts are in addition to the engineering  research and development and support expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products and services totaled million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  are approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance includes million of product and service orders for the wireless test and measurement  revenue assurance information  and mobile power product lines  and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
since the rollout of the company s large scale mobile testing network  two national wireless providers have contracted with the company for quality of service information services 
the company is in discussions with several additional potential customers and expects continued growth for its wireless test and measurement services 
management believes that substantially all of the products and services backlog amount of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s product orders are filled within months from receipt of the order 
the remaining unfilled orders of million are related to the wireless vertical applications and terminals product line 
this backlog balance consists of million of new product orders and million of long term maintenance agreements 
the company is well into the process of negotiating new multi year agreements for the maintenance and operation of the california installed base 
the first two contracts  worth approximately million  were negotiated and are part of the year end backlog in fiscal year additionally  since the end of fiscal year  the company has signed an upgrade contract and new maintenance and operation agreements with orange county  california that together are valued at approximately million 
in this wireless vertical applications and terminals area  the company continues to invest heavily in a number of large opportunities such as the pennsylvania turnpike authority  and the states of texas  louisiana  florida  georgia  nevada  utah and colorado 
comarco wireless has experienced  in each of the past six years  a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the latter half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half of the fiscal year  although this trend has been declining over the same six years 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the deployment schedule of wireless network operators in both north american and international markets  which can be delayed by both economic and political issues  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  capacity and production constraints associated with single source component suppliers  and other competitive factors 
historically  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of any given quarter 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of revenues could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
net interest income interest income  less interest expense for fiscal year totaled  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is principally due to lower available investable balances year to year  along with lower interest rates 
the company s continuing operations effective tax rate is for fiscal year  which is level with the for the previous fiscal year 
the overall decrease in continuing operations net income from the prior year is primarily due to lower gross profit contribution dollars as noted above 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  continuing operations revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s wireless test and measurement  wireless revenue assurance information  and wireless terminals callbox systems and the initial introduction and market trials of chargesource tm  a wireless accessory universal power adapter 
the rapid growth of cellular and pcs markets  proliferation of digital communication technologies  and the expanding number of telephone carriers have created greater demand for the company s products 
during fiscal year  the company s product introductions included baseline tm  allowing wireless carriers to track the quality of their networks as well as the quality of their competitors systems 
the company s wireless terminals callbox systems also had significant growth in fiscal year late in the year  the company commenced market trials of its universal power adapter  chargesource tm  which is designed to charge all portable electronic devices commonly used by a business traveler 
gross profit percentage of continuing operations revenues was in fiscal year compared with in the prior fiscal year 
the decreased gross margin percentage is due to greater sales of the company s wireless terminals callbox systems and market trial sales of the wireless accessory universal power adapter product  which have lower gross margins than the wireless test and measurement and revenue assurance information product families 
indirect costs increased million or year to year 
selling and general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal year  up from the comparable period last year 
research and development expense and sustaining engineering and product support expenses totaled million during fiscal year compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income for continuing operations was million for fiscal year compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the year to year decrease in operating income percentage is primarily due to lower gross profit contribution from the increased sales of wireless terminals callbox and wireless accessory universal power adapter product lines  as discussed above 
the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications products business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  in fiscal year these amounts are in addition to the research and development expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products totaled million for fiscal year  compared with million during fiscal year unfilled orders at january  totaled million  of which million is associated with the long term maintenance contracts and million is associated with post contract customer support obligations which has been recorded as deferred revenue 
in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop entitled software revenue recognition 
this statement updates sop which was issued in  and it provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized and in what amounts for licensing  selling  leasing  or otherwise marketing computer software 
the provisions of the new statement were applied prospectively in fiscal year the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial position or operating results of the company 
the company has experienced fluctuations in wireless communications products activity in each of the past five years  with greater sales in the second half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half  although this trend has been declining over the same five years 
this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its wireless communications products offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
results of discontinued operations in july  the company announced that it was embarking on a plan to strengthen the company s focus on the wireless communications products and services business area 
this plan  which was formalized at the end of the quarter ended october   involves selling the company s information technology and staffing services product lines 
therefore  this segment is presented as discontinued operations and prior periods have been restated 
subsequent to fiscal year end and as of april   the company has closed three out of six currently planned divestiture transactions 
the aggregate consideration received to date is million 
the remaining transactions are in varying stages of completion 
the company does not expect to realize a loss on the sale of the discontinued segment  however at this time  management cannot determine the amount of gain that may result from the sale 
revenues provided by the discontinued operations totaled million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decreased revenues are due to the completion of the company s contract at reagan washington national airport which ended on september   a reduction in commercial staffing services revenue  partially offset by increased information technology staffing services revenues 
sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were of the company s total revenues from continuing and discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended january  government agencies may terminate their contracts in whole or in part at their convenience 
government agencies may remove funding previously provided or may not exercise option periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the government will fund the portions of existing contracts that are unfunded  or that the governmental agencies will exercise any options 
the company is experiencing a greater percentage of its information technology and staffing services revenue from fixed price and fixed labor rate contracts versus cost reimbursable contracts 
fixed price and fixed labor rate contracts shift more of the performance risk to the company 
therefore  if the company s assumptions or performance do not meet expectations  reduced profits or losses could be realized 
the operating loss revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for discontinued operations was million in fiscal year compared with operating income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the current operating loss is due to the recording of a final pre tax million loss to terminate two fixed price contracts with a single government agency and an additional pre tax loss of million related to the change in management s estimate to complete a multi year fixed price contract after completion of protracted negotiations with the us air force over the company s request for equitable adjustment 
the negotiation resulted in additional funding of million and a month contract extension 
the modified contract now ends in march the million provision is based on the company s assumptions and future performance expectations over the remaining month contract performance period of the contract as of january  if the company s assumptions or performance do not meet expectations  additional loss provisions would be required 
discontinued net loss was million in fiscal year compared with net income of million a year ago 
revenues provided by discontinued operations totaled million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the increased revenue of year to year is due to a increase in information technology staffing services and a increase in commercial staffing services  offset by a reduction in airport management staffing services due to the completion of the company s contract at reagan washington national airport  which ended on september  this contract contributed million in revenue in the year ended january  the company decided not to pursue the recompete of this contract since it was marginally profitable  and it would have been unprofitable if reawarded to the company 
sales to the us government as well as to government prime contractors were of the company s total revenues from continuing and discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended january  in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
in march  the company announced the award of a five year government contract three year base period with two one year options with an estimated value of million to continue to provide engineering and management services to the us navy at crane  indiana 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
in fiscal year  the company recorded a  charge against operating income from the impairment of certain assets of its information technology and staffing services software development operation 
this charge was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based upon marketing initiatives which proved unsuccessful in the fourth quarter  the company determined that the expected future cash flows were not sufficient to cover the remaining unamortized intangible assets 
accordingly  the complete impairment of these assets was recorded in the restated discontinued operations results 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for the discontinued segment was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year after giving effect to a million non recurring  non cash charge for the write off of the remaining intangible assets associated with the company s information technology and staffing services software development operation 
net income from discontinued operations was million in fiscal year compared to million a year earlier 
liquidity and capital resources the company signed a loan agreement with a bank effective september   which was last amended effective august  the loan agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility  which expires june  the company expects to renew the loan agreement under similar terms and conditions 
the revolving credit facility is unsecured provided that the company maintains certain covenants 
currently  management anticipates that cash flow will remain at a level which will enable the company to avoid utilizing the credit facility except to support letters of credit and acquisition financing  and that the company will be able to purchase investments on a regular basis 
the company s cash and investment balances averaged million excludes investments in the company s deferred compensation plan for executives during the fourth quarter of fiscal year however  maintaining such cash balances is predicated on the company maintaining its business base and is subject to the cost of financing new contracts  acquisitions  geographic expansion  software product development costs  and stock re purchases 
in july  the company announced that it was embarking on a plan to strengthen the company s focus on the wireless communications products and services business area 
this plan  which was formalized at the end of the quarter ended october   involves selling the company s information technology and staffing services product lines 
therefore  this segment is presented as discontinued operations and the consolidated balance sheet reflects net assets available for sale of million as of january  subsequent to fiscal year end and as of april   the company has closed three out of six planned divestiture transactions 
the aggregate consideration received to date is million 
the remaining transactions are in varying stages of completion 
during fiscal year  the company s average days sales in accounts receivable for continuing operations have been reduced from days at the end of fiscal year to days as of january  the reduction is due to improved cash collection procedures and lower international sales activity whose receivables on average  take longer to collect 
several additional key factors indicating the company s financial condition include january  january  current ratio working   capital book value per share the company continued to demonstrate solid financial strength in the above financial factors during fiscal year during fiscal year  the company generated million of cash flows from continuing operations operating activities  up sharply from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is due to better management of the company s working capital 
cash flows from operating activities  along with a portion of the company s investments  were used to fund a number of financing and investing activities  as discussed below 
the company has a significant commitment for capital expenditures at january  for comarco wireless 
the company has developed and intends to continue developing numerous new product line extensions for the wireless communications industry 
this software product development program is expected to be funded from the company s current working capital 
the amounts capitalized and amortized in the company s wireless communications products business in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  totaled million and million  respectively  in fiscal year the company s board of directors has authorized a stock re purchase program of up to  shares 
as of january   the company has re purchased and retired approximately  shares of which  shares in the amount of million were re purchased during fiscal year the average price paid per share re purchased under the program was 
the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial condition of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to satisfy the current and anticipated capital requirements for operations during fiscal year new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards boards issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
year issue the year issue results from a programming convention in which computer programs use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year the year issue 
software  hardware or firmware may recognize a date using as the year  rather than the year such an inability of computer programs to recognize a year that begins with could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company undertook a program to address the year issue with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems  ii the company s non information technology systems such as buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain embedded microcontroller technology  iii certain systems of the company s major vendors and material service providers insofar as they relate to the company s business activities with such parties  and iv the company s material clients insofar as the year issue relates to the company s ability to provide services to such clients 
no public infrastructure problems or any other significant problems with respect to any of the areas listed in the previous paragraph were encountered during rollover to the year after system verification and testing  the company s systems are operating normally 
the company is not aware of any significant issues related to the year issue 
the company continues to monitor the status of its operations  major vendors  material service providers and material clients to ensure that no significant business interruptions occur 
costs incurred to achieve year readiness were charged to expense as incurred 
such costs included both internal resources dedicated to achieving year compliance  as well as the costs of independent consultants retained to assess the company s year initiatives 
substantially all of the company s year costs were incurred prior to january  the year costs incurred were not material to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
as of january   the company had no accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s standard terms require foreign customers to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  the company may limit its exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
such activity to date has been insignificant 
the company s interest rate risk in the year ended january  was limited to a minor amount of available for sale investments  these investments were sold during the year ended january   and therefore  the interest rate risk was eliminated
