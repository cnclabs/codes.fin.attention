in june  the company formed a joint venture in korea with samsung electronics 
this joint venture is owned by the company and owned by samsung  and has been organized to design  develop  and manufacture atmospheric flat panel display loaders along with other products 
the company consolidated fully the financial position and results of operations of the joint venture and accounts for the minority interest in the financial statements 
the company s product revenues include sales of hardware and software products 
the company s service revenues are primarily comprised of tool control application consulting services  consulting  software customization and spare parts sales 
many of the company s customers purchase the company s vacuum transfer robots and other modules before purchasing the company s vacuum central wafer handling systems 
the company believes that once a customer has selected the company s products for a process tool  the customer is likely to rely on those products for the life of that process tool model  which can be in excess of five years 
conversely  losing a bid for a manufacturing execution system mes does not preclude the company from securing optimization products to fit with a competitor s mes 
a significant portion of the company s revenues have been generated by sales to customers in the united states  although the company believes that a significant portion of these customers incorporate the company s products into equipment sold to their foreign customers 
the company s foreign sales have occurred principally in asia and europe 
sales in asia have occurred primarily in japan and south korea  and  to a lesser extent  in taiwan and singapore 
the company s foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of the company s international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of the company s international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent that the company expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  the company will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation 
the company s business is highly dependent upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers which historically have been cyclical  and the company s ability to develop  manufacture and sell new products and product enhancements 
the company s revenues grew substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal due in large part to high levels of capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
the company cannot guarantee that these levels of expenditure will be sustained in fiscal the company s results will also be affected  especially when measured on a quarterly basis  by the volume  composition and timing of orders  conditions in industries served by the company  competition and general economic conditions 
results of operations year ended september   compared to year ended september  the company reported net income of million for the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million in the previous year 
the results for the year ended september  include million of amortization of acquired intangible assets and million of acquisition related charges 
the company s net loss attributable to common stockholders in the previous year includes million of amortization of acquired intangible assets  million of acquisition related and restructuring charges and other costs and million of accretion and dividends on preferred stock 
there was no accretion or dividends on preferred stock in the year ended september  revenues the company reported revenues of million in the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the overall increase is principally attributable to the strength in both the original equipment manufacturer oem and end user markets and incremental revenue from acquisitions

interest income and expense interest income decreased by  to million  in the year ended september   compared to million in the previous year  due primarily to lower cash and investment asset balances 
interest expense decreased by  to million in the year ended september   from million in the previous year 
fiscal interest expense includes million to retire debt in conjunction with the acquisition of fastech 
the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced borrowings and the aforementioned fiscal debt retirement charge 
income tax benefit the company recorded net tax benefits of million and million in the years ended september  and  respectively 
these tax benefits are primarily due to anticipated future tax benefit of domestic net operating losses and research and development credits  which were partially offset by million and million increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at september   an increase of million from september  the company realized proceeds  net of issuance costs  of million from a public offering of shares of its common stock in march in connection with its acquisition of asc and asi on january   the company paid daifuku america million in cash and issued daifuku america a note in the amount of million  which is due on january  the company has invested net million of excess cash in short and long term marketable securities 
at september   million was invested in marketable securities with maturities of one year or less and million in marketable securities which will mature october  or later 
cash used in operations was million  and is primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  million and million  respectively  partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million  and increases of million in accounts payable  million in deferred revenue  million in accrued compensation and benefits and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable and inventories is primarily attributable to the company s recent rapid growth 
the company s increased sales  particularly in asia  combined with a greater number of long term contracts  have also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million  and was principally comprised of million for the purchase of marketable securities  partially offset by million of marketable securities sold matured  million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired primarily the acquisition of asc and asi and million used for capital additions  primarily in its telecommunications systems infrastructure and for computer requirements  including expenditures needed to accommodate the company s expanding capacity needs  such as the completion this year of its additional facility in chelmsford  massachusetts

in december  the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
in june  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
b  an amendment to sab  which delays the implementation of sab the application of the guidance in sab will now be required in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal the company is currently determining the impact that sab may have on its financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
this statement was amended by the issuance of statement no 
 deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which changed the effective date of fas to all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
this statement was further amended by statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the company s management anticipates that the adoption of fas will not have a significant effect on the company s results or operations or financial position  as the company currently does not utilize derivative instruments 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by brooks or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties such as those described below that could cause actual results to differ materially from targets or projected results 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
while these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider  you should know that they are not the only risks or uncertainties facing us or which may adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could you lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risks relating to our operations the cyclical demand of semiconductor manufacturers affects our operating results 
our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the level of semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditures is dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
during these downturns  our revenues have dropped  and we have incurred losses 
we believe that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will occur in the future and will result in decreased demand for our products 
despite the addition of our factory automation business in fiscal  our financial results will continue to be dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
downturns in the semiconductor business  when fewer new facilities are being built  could harm our financial results as have downturns in the past 
our sales volume depends on the sales volume of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
we sell a majority of our tool automation products to original equipment manufacturers who incorporate our products into their equipment 
therefore  our revenues are directly dependent on the ability of these customers to develop and market their equipment in a timely  cost effective manner 
we rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues in each fiscal period from a limited number of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers  or a decrease in orders by one or more customers  would adversely affect our business 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the years ended september  and  respectively 
sales to lam research corporation  our largest customer  accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the years ended september  and  respectively 
delays in shipment of a few of our large orders could substantially decrease our revenues 
historically  a substantial portion of our quarterly and annual revenues came from sales of a small number of large orders 
these orders consist of products with high selling prices compared to our other products 
as a result  the timing of the recognition of revenue from one of these large orders can have a significant impact on our total revenues and operating results for a particular period 
our operating results could be harmed if orders for even a small number of large orders are canceled or rescheduled by customers or cannot be filled due to delays in manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance 
we have significant fixed costs which are not easily reduced if revenues fall below expectations 
our expense levels are based in part on our future revenue expectations 
many of our expenses  particularly those relating to capital equipment and manufacturing overhead  are relatively fixed 
if we do not meet our sales goals we may be unable to rapidly reduce these fixed costs 
our ability to reduce expenses is further constrained because we must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position to maintain service and support for our existing global customer base 
accordingly  if we suffer an unexpected downturn in revenue  our inability to reduce fixed costs rapidly could increase the adverse impact on our results of operations 
our lengthy sales cycle requires us to incur significant expenses with no assurance that we will generate revenue 
our tool automation products are generally incorporated into original equipment manufacturer equipment at the design stage 
to obtain new business from our original equipment manufacturer customers  we must develop products for selection by a potential customer at the design stage 
this often requires us to make significant expenditures  without any assurance of success 
the original equipment manufacturer s design decisions often precede the generation of volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
we also must complete successfully a lengthy evaluation period before we can achieve volume sales of our manufacturing execution system software and process optimization software to our factory automation customers 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to achieve design wins or satisfy evaluations by our factory automation customers of our software 
we cannot guarantee that the equipment manufactured by our original equipment manufacturing customers will be commercially successful 
if we or our original equipment manufacturing customers fail to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner  our business and financial results will suffer 
our international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments 
approximately and of our total revenues were derived from customers located outside north america in the years ended september  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our vendors are located in several different foreign countries 
as a result of our international business operations  we are subject to various risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries  challenges presented by collecting trade accounts receivable in foreign jurisdictions  possible adverse tax consequences  governmental currency controls  changes in various regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  and export import controls and tariff regulations 
to support our international customers  we maintain locations in several countries  including canada  germany  japan  malaysia  singapore  south korea  taiwan  france and the united kingdom 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage these operations effectively 
we cannot assure you that our investment in these international operations will enable us to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of our customers  some of whom are located in countries where we have no infrastructure 
although our international sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates can make it more difficult for us to compete with foreign manufacturers on price 
if our international sales increase relative to our total revenues  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
we must continually improve our technology to remain competitive 
technology changes rapidly in the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
we believe our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and market new products to meet customer needs 
we cannot guarantee that we will identify and adjust to changing market conditions or succeed in introducing commercially rewarding products or product enhancements 
the success of our product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurately identifying and defining new products  completing and introducing new product designs in a timely manner  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and determining a comprehensive  integrated product strategy 
we face significant competition which could result in decreased demand for our products or services 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully 
we believe that our primary competition in the tool automation market is from integrated original equipment manufacturers that satisfy their semiconductor and flat panel display handling needs themselves rather than by purchasing systems or modules from an independent supplier like us 
many of these original equipment manufacturers have substantially greater resources than we do 
applied materials  inc  the leading process equipment original equipment manufacturer  develops and manufactures its own central wafer handling systems and modules 
we may not be successful in selling our products to original equipment manufacturers that currently satisfy their wafer or substrate handling needs themselves  regardless of the performance or the price of our products 
moreover  integrated original equipment manufacturers may begin to commercialize their handling capabilities and become our competitors 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the end user semiconductor manufacturer market for factory automation software and process control software are product functionality  price performance  ease of use  hardware and software platform compatibility  vendor reputation and financial stability 
the relative importance of these competitive factors may change over time 
we directly compete in this market with various competitors  including applied materials consilium  pri promis  ibm poseidon and numerous small  independent software companies 
we also compete with the in house software staffs of semiconductor manufacturers like nec 
most of those manufacturers have substantially greater resources than us 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the factory interface market are technical and technological capabilities  reliability  price performance  ease of integration and global sales and support capability 
in this market  we compete directly with asyst  fortrend  kensington and rorze 
some of these competitors have substantial financial resources and extensive engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
much of our success and value lies in our ownership and use of intellectual property and our failure to protect that property could adversely affect our future growth 
our ability to compete is heavily affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  patents  copyrights  trademarks and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection 
our patents could be invalidated or circumvented 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not fully protect our products or intellectual property rights 
this may make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
we may engage in litigation to enforce our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  defend ourselves against claims we infringe on the rights of others  or determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of our management  which could harm our operating results 
our operations could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
particular aspects of our technology could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights or patents of others 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to seek licenses or alter our products so that they no longer infringe on the rights of others 
we cannot guarantee that the terms of any licenses we may be required to seek will be reasonable 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing on the rights of others may be costly or impractical or could detract from the value of our products 
our business may be harmed by infringement claims of general signal or applied materials 
we received notice from general signal corporation alleging infringements of its patent rights by certain of our products 
the notification advised us that general signal was attempting to enforce its rights to those patents in litigation against applied materials  and that  at the conclusion of that litigation  general signal intended to enforce its rights against us and others 
according to a press release issued by applied materials in november  applied materials settled its litigation with general signal by acquiring ownership of five general signal patents 
although not verified by us  these five patents would appear to be the patents referred to by general signal in its prior notice to us 
applied materials has not contacted us regarding these patents 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
our future growth relies in part on the commercial adoption of mm wafer technology  which is progressing more slowly than expected  and competition for mm orders may be intense 
our future growth relies in part on the adoption of new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the industry transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is occurring more slowly than expected 
any significant delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology  or the failure of the industry to adopt mm manufacturing technology  could significantly reduce our opportunities for future growth 
moreover  continued delay in transition to mm technology could permit our competitors to introduce competing or superior mm products 
competition  including price competition  for such mm orders could be vigorous and could harm our results of operations 
risks relating to our growth rapid growth is straining our operations and requiring us to incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure 
during the last year  we have experienced extremely rapid growth in our operations  the number of our employees  our product offerings and the geographic area of our operations 
our growth places a significant strain on our management  operations and financial systems 
our future operating results will be dependent in part on our ability to continue to implement and improve our operating and financial controls and management information systems 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition  results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results would be harmed if one of our key suppliers fails to deliver components for our products 
we currently procure many of our components on an as needed  purchase order basis 
we do not carry significant inventories or have any long term supply contracts with our vendors 
with the recent increased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  our suppliers are facing significant challenges in providing components on a timely basis 
our inability to obtain components in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in significant delays or reductions in product shipments 
this would materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our business could be harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of our acquisitions 
our management must devote substantial time and resources to the integration of the operations of our acquired businesses with our business and with each other 
if we fail to accomplish this integration efficiently  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  research and development initiatives  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of the operation of our acquired businesses  presents a significant challenge to our management 
this is compounded by the challenge of simultaneously managing a larger entity 
we have completed a number of acquisitions in a short period of time 
these businesses have operations and personnel located in asia  europe and the united states and present a number of additional difficulties of integration  including difficulties in the assimilation of products and designs into integrated solutions  difficulties in informing customers  suppliers and distributors of the effects of the acquisitions and integrating them into our overall operations  difficulties integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and cultures  difficulties in defining and executing a comprehensive product strategy  difficulties in managing geographically remote units  difficulties associated with managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience  and difficulties in minimizing the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 
if we delay integrating or fail to integrate an acquired business or experience other unforeseen difficulties  the integration process may require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention and financial and other resources 
our failure to adequately address these difficulties could harm our business and financial results 
our business may be harmed by acquisitions we complete in the future 
we plan to continue to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business  diversion of our management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
if we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions  we will be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete 
should we successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business 
we may not be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel because of intense competition for highly skilled personnel 
we need to hire and retain substantial numbers of employees with technical backgrounds for both our hardware and software engineering and support staffs 
the market for these employees is intensely competitive  and we have occasionally experienced delays in hiring these personnel 
due to the cyclical nature of the demand for our products  we have had to reduce our workforce and then rebuild our workforce as our business has gone through downturns followed by upturns 
we currently need to hire a number of highly skilled employees  especially in manufacturing  to meet customer demand 
due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate  this type of employment cycle increases our risk of not being able to retain and recruit key personnel 
our inability to recruit  retain and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to develop  manufacture  install and support our products 
risks relating to our common stock our operating results fluctuate significantly  which could negatively impact our business and our stock price 
our margins  revenues and other operating results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors  including the level of demand for semiconductors in general  cycles in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and automation software  the timing and size of orders from our customer base  our ability to manufacture  test and deliver products in a timely and cost effective manner  our success in winning competitions for orders  the timing of our new product announcements and releases and those of our competitors  the mix of products sold by us  competitive pricing pressures  and the level of automation required in fab extensions  upgrades and new facilities 
we entered into the factory automation software business in fiscal we believe a portion of our revenues from this business is dependent on achieving project milestones 
as a result  our revenue from this business will be subject to fluctuations depending upon a number of factors  including whether we can achieve project milestones on a timely basis  if at all  as well as the timing and size of projects 
the volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between april  and april   the closing price of our common stock rose from approximately to per share 
between april  and may   the price of our common stock dropped from approximately to per share 
consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices  and we may not be able to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
factors affecting our stock price may include variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts expectations  changes in the market price per share of our public company customers  market conditions in the industry  general economic conditions  low trading volume of our common stock  and the number of firms making a market in our common stock 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like us 
these market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and contracts may discourage takeover offers and may limit the price investors would be willing to pay for our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make an acquisition of us more difficult and discourage changes in our management 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  we have adopted a rights plan 
in many potential takeover situations  rights issued under the plan become exercisable to purchase our common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of our common stock 
because of its possible dilutive effect to a potential acquirer  the rights plan would generally discourage third parties from proposing a merger with or initiating a tender offer for us that is not approved by our board of directors 
accordingly  the rights plan could have an adverse impact on our stockholders who might want to vote in favor of the merger or participate in the tender offer 
in addition  shares of our preferred stock may be issued upon terms the board of directors deems appropriate without stockholder approval 
our ability to issue preferred stock in such a manner could enable our board of directors to prevent changes in our management or control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company believes within a confidence level that its overall interest exposure at september   including all interest rate sensitive instruments  a near term change in interest rates  based on historical interest rate movements  would not materially affect the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
currency rate exposure brooks foreign revenues are generally denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
the costs and expenses of brooks international subsidiaries are generally denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
however  since the functional currency of brooks international subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign translation adjustments do not impact operating results  but instead are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
to the extent brooks expands its international operations or changes its pricing practices to denominate prices in foreign currencies  brooks will be exposed to increased risk of currency fluctuation
