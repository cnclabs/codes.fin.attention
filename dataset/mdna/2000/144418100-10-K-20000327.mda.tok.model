however  because of unfavorable conditions currently existing in the reit public equity and debt markets  the company does not believe that these markets are currently providing the company with the most attractive sources of capital

however  the company s ability to continue to fund all of its current development projects could be adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits from any hedging agreements of the company  would increase our interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under its line of credit that bears interest at a floating rate and of additional fixed rate mortgage debt 
hq global also had million outstanding under its unsecured credit facility as of december  which was guaranteed by the company 
the unsecured credit facilities mature in august and the mortgage loans mature at various times through the company also has issued million senior unsecured notes  which mature between and the company is currently a party to an interest rate hedge agreement in order to hedge against the impact that interest rate fluctuations would have on the floating rate debt under its line of credit 
although the hedging agreements enable us to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate liabilities  they expose us to the risk that the counterparties to such hedge agreements may not perform  negating the benefit of the hedging arrangements 
in addition  if interest rates decline after we enter into a hedging agreement  our interest expense would be higher than the underlying floating rate and could result in us making payments to unwind such agreements 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective october  which converts million of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce the company s market risk from changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swap agreement expires april  the company s future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates

the company also uses certain derivative financial instruments at times to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
if the market rates of interest on the company s variable rate debt change by or approximately basis points the company s interest expense would change by approximately million  assuming the amount outstanding under the variable rate credit facilities remains at million  the balance at december  furthermore book value of these variable interest credit facilities approximates market value at december  a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flows for fixed rate debt instruments  but as fixed rate debt matures and if additional debt is acquired to fund the repayments under maturing facilities  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to debt maturities 
the following is a summary of the fixed rate mortgages and senior unsecured debt maturities in thousands thereafter  assuming the repayments of fixed rate borrowings are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit arrangements  a percent change in the market interest rate for the respective fixed rate debt instruments would change the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt by approximately million

because we have made loans to foreign affiliates  omni uk and lux  we are exposed to risks that there will be a significant change in the rate of exchange between the united states dollar and various foreign currencies  as well as the possibility of the imposition or modification of exchange controls by governments or monetary authorities 
these risks generally depend on factors beyond our control  such as economic  financial and political events and the supply and demand for various currencies 
we may invest in other entities with operations in foreign countries  and if we do  the same risks will apply to the currencies utilized in those countries 
the company s current exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not significant
