item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources june  as compared to june  during the year ended june   ameralia incurred significant working capital shortages which it resolved through borrowings and sales of its capital stock to accredited investors 
ameralia o raised  through the sale of common stock to accredited investors  o borrowed  from charles d 
o kieffe  a shareholder  in october  and o borrowed million from nationsbank  na now bank of america in two increments in september and january in july  we borrowed a further million from bank of america under the same terms and conditions 
these bank of america loans are guaranteed by ameralia s principal shareholder for a fee payable in restricted shares as explained at item a certain relationships and related party transactions under guaranty agreement 
the number of shares of restricted common stock to be issued to pay the fee is based upon future market prices of the company s common stock  hence the obligation to pay the guarantee fee is recorded as a current liability in the company s financial statements until the shares are issued 
this liability for the fee was  at june   and the aggregate liability to the bank of america was  in conjunction with the renegotiation of the guaranty fees  the term of this aggregated loan has been extended to september ameralia met its working capital requirements in excess of these borrowings in a number of ways during the past fiscal year  and these are continuing into the fiscal year 
o ameralia has deferred paying some accounts and royalties payable 
this includes approximately  at june   in minimum royalties and consulting fees due to kinder  the vendor of the lease for our rock school project 
this obligation is not secured by our property  kinder has not demanded payment of these amounts  and we intend to bring this account current when adequate funds are available 
o in july we paid the bank of america  interest that was due on june  o throughout the year  we deferred paying  to various related parties for directors fees and other compensation due them 
we intend to pay these fees when adequate funds are available 
during the year  we also issued  shares of our restricted common stock to a contractor to prepay certain construction costs with a value to ameralia of million 
as plant construction progresses we shall bring this prepayment to account as capitalised construction expenditure 
at the beginning of the year we held  in an escrow account for us filter under our design build agreement 
during the year  we paid this money together with an additional  to us filter to progress their plant design activities and to fabricate plant and equipment 
we expended a further  in engineering  consulting  legal  and other fees and costs to obtain the blm decision record that enables us commence on site construction  subject to our raising satisfactory long term financing 
these costs were capitalised in our accounts as they contributed to a definable improvement in the value of the rock school lease 
in the fiscal year  we expended approximately  for the same purpose but as the blm decision outcome was unresolved at the end of the fiscal year  those costs were expensed in that period 
we invested a further  in advancing our efforts to secure long term finance 
when this financing is secured  we will amortise these costs over the term of the financing 
finally  our resources were used to fund our operating loss of  for the year 
we also settled a contingent liability of  through arbitration for  in summary  total assets increased during the year to    and stockholders equity decreased to ameralia has historically derived its liquidity from raising new equity investment or by issuing notes payable 
ameralia s ability to ensure its long term survival continues to be dependent upon ameralia constructing the proposed plant and securing financing for its construction  estimated to be up to million 
ameralia reached an agreement with us filter to provide construction financing  but us filter s agreement is subject to numerous conditions and  to date  us filter has not advanced any funds pursuant to that agreement 
we have complied with our obligation to provide million to initiate the design and construction activities 
we are negotiating with prospective investors and financiers to achieve this financing objective  although there can be no assurance we will be able to complete this financing 
until we obtain adequate long term financing  we will be unable to advance the construction of the rock school project further 
it is our goal to maintain the rock school project in a ready status until we have received the necessary funding and therefore are able to actively commence construction activities on site 
until  if ever  the rock school project has been constructed and has commenced operations  we will not have any product for sale and will not receive operating revenues 
until we receive our long term financing  we will continue to be dependent on equity placements to accredited investors and short term debt financing as in the past 
we will continue to engage in appropriate cash management techniques 
a potential source of equity capital in the future is through the exercise of our outstanding common stock purchase warrants and options 
a total of  options are currently outstanding 
the outstanding options  if exercised in whole or part  would result in additional capital for ameralia 
the option exercise prices range from to  however  it is not likely that any person will exercise options unless the market price for the shares exceeded the option exercise prices on a sustained basis 
furthermore  ameralia will not permit any person to exercise options unless the underlying shares of common stock were included in an effective registration statement  or unless an exemption from registration was available 
june  as compared to june  during the fiscal year  ameralia raised a total of  through the sale of preferred stock  common stock and warrants to accredited investors and to investors outside of the united states 
these securities were issued for cash  cancellation of debt and in exchange for an investment in the rural investment trust 
this investment was subsequently liquidated raising we funded further capital expenditures on the rock school lease development  and on deposits under the design build agreement with us filter 
in addition  we provided  in additional funding to the escrow account under the design build agreement 
principally  the balance of the funds we raised were used to increase cash reserves by  and to fund ameralia s operating loss 
the operating loss includes a contingency for  an amount we are disputing with raytheon 
this dispute was settled during the fiscal year for our payment to raytheon of  as a result of the fund raising throughout the year  total assets increased to    and stockholders equity increased to   
results of operations june  as compared to june  since ameralia does not receive revenues from operations  any income it receives is generally derived from interest earned on funds on deposit resulting from stock subscriptions 
interest income in was nearly  compared with less than  in the previous year 
general and administrative expenditures were less this year than for last year    and  however  as explained above last year s expenses included approximately  of expenditures which ultimately contributed to the blm decision record approving our mining plan but were written off in in view of the blm outcome  a similar level of expenditure the year was capitalised and this has caused the general and administrative expenditures to be substantially reduced 
as noted above  ameralia financed a significant portion of its operations through debt incurred during and after fiscal as a consequence of the increased level of debt  interest expense has increased substantially    and this will increase further unless equity capital can be raised to repay the debt finance 
general administrative costs also include the amortisation of fees paid to secure short term finance facilities 
these fees  including the guaranty fees discussed above  are amortised over the term of the loans 
financing costs amortised or written off in fiscal totalled  it is likely that ameralia will continue to recognize significant operating losses and negative cash flow until if ever after its rock school project has been completed and operating profitably 
there is a number of significant contingencies that result in this possibility being one of significant risk  and there can be no assurance that ameralia will ever achieve profitable operations or a positive cash flow 
june  as compared to june  interest income in was less than  and less than  in general and administrative expenditures were significantly higher this year than for previous years   and  as expected as a result of the increased activity associated with obtaining funding for the development of ameralia s lease and construction of production facilities 
interest expense has been reduced further as a result of lower debt   and 
consequently  the net loss of  significantly exceeded those of prior years  and 
contributing to this loss was an expenditure of approximately  paid to external consultants in connection with developing the permitting applications and development plans associated with the development of our resource  approximately  in management and staff salaries due to higher staffing levels  and increased consulting fees as a result of increased corporate activities 
we have a dispute with raytheon concerning additional work it performed which we consider to be outside the specifications of the work orders 
we are disputing this amount and have agreed with raytheon to go to mediation and or arbitration to settle the matter 
meanwhile we have provided for a contingency of  in our financial statements 
under our design build agreement with us filter we contributed  to an escrow account to fund the initial design and construction activities 
our agreement provides that if we cannot secure suitable long term financing  us filter is entitled to substantial liquidated damages 
its interests are secured by our interests in the rock school lease until ameralia achieves its objective of establishing a plant for the recovery and production of sodium bicarbonate  it will not be able to generate operating revenues 
whilst we are progressing negotiations with various prospective investors and financiers  we have not reached any definitive agreements to enable us to build our proposed facilities 
we estimate up to million will be required to fund construction and the associated working capital requirements until profitable operations are established 
there is no assurance that ameralia can obtain this financing and  in the meantime  we must fund our operating losses from our own resources as discussed above 
impact of inflation ameralia believes that its activities are not materially affected by inflation
