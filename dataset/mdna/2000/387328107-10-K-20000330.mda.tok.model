item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general granite is one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and is engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
the company has offices in california  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  and utah 
the company s contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies  and private parties 
the company s bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts to the company may vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from construction contracts including construction joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based upon costs incurred and projected costs 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related earnings are not recognized until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contracts frequently extend over a period of more than one year and revisions in cost and profit estimates during construction are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revision become known 
losses on contracts  if any  are provided in total when determined  regardless of the degree of project completion 
claims for additional contract revenue are recognized in the period when it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenue and the amount can be reliably estimated 
the foregoing as well as weather  stage of completion  and mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods 
the company s compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
thus  the company may experience an increase in general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and a decrease in less profitable years 
the company s profit sharing and pension contribution in excess of the k matching contributions is at the discretion of the board of directors based on the company reaching certain levels of profitability each year 
current year in thousands increase revenue branch division heavy construction division revenue and backlog 
the increased revenue in was primarily attributable to increased revenue from private sector contracts which increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the company s private sector work is primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects 
the private sector revenue growth has been significantly influenced by the continued strong growth in residential and commercial building construction during in california  one of the company s largest markets  new building construction increased during to billion from billion in  according to the construction industry research board 
the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million in from million in while decreasing to of the company s total revenue in from in although the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong in in most of the company s markets  the increased tea funding has not yet significantly impacted the company s revenue see outlook 
the increase in branch division revenue during the year resulted from increases in revenue from private sector contracts and an increase in material sales both of which are strongly correlated to increases in private sector construction and general economic conditions partially offset by a slight decrease in public sector revenue 
the increase in hcd revenue is attributable to significantly drier weather conditions  particularly in texas and florida  and included revenue from a larger number of both private and public sector projects which include a private sector railroad project in texas which was awarded in mid  a private sector design build tollroad project in texas which was awarded in and a public sector design build highway project in arizona which was awarded in late the company s backlog at december  was million  down million  or from the decrease in backlog was due primarily to the absence of hcd awards in the fourth quarter 
management believes that approximately of the work in the backlog at december  will be recognized as revenue during the company believes its bidding opportunities in its major marketplaces remain strong see outlook 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin was a result of the continued favorable market conditions in both the public and private sectors as described above  which tends to increase the company s ability to win competitively bid projects at higher margins 
additionally  gross profit margin in was positively impacted by drier weather conditions  which allowed for more efficient utilization of resources  and the successful execution of several hcd projects that were added to backlog in mid to late project to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under general above  the company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
during  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in the revenue from projects that were less than complete 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses comprised the following in thousands in thousands salaries and related expenses   incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and pension   other general and administrative expenses   total   percent of revenue salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support the company s current and expected growth 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs increased in over as a function of the company s increased profitability 
other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support its operations  none of which exceeds of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflect the absence of the collection of a previously written off bad debt that was recognized in and increases in other costs to support the company s growth 
operating income 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income in increased over the contribution due to increases in both the volume of work and the profit margins the division was able to achieve 
the division s profit margins were positively impacted by the successful execution of new work that was added to backlog in mid to late  including two design build projects  as well as drier weather conditions and improved margins on projects nearing completion 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in decreased slightly compared to due primarily to the absence of the collection of a previously written off bad debt and increases in other costs to support the company s growth 
other income expenses 
other income decreased million to million in the decrease was due primarily to a loss experienced by tic  in which the company has a equity investment 
the company s share of tic s loss was approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from the company s share of tic income in this decrease was partially offset by a million gain recorded on the sale of a depleted quarry property 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in  an increase of from the increase was primarily due to a lower impact of the company s percentage depletion deduction due to higher pre tax earnings 
outlook 
as granite enters on the heels of a record breaking year  the outlook for the company s financial performance going forward continues to be very good 
the drivers of our business  public sector funding of the infrastructure and the overall economy  appear to be very strong 
the us economy continues to grow  producing demand for residential and commercial development and creating good overall demand for construction services including materials in many of the company s geographic regions 
public sector funding has a very strong foundation supplied by the federal government  through the transportation equity act for the st century tea  and state and local governments have solid transportation capital and maintenance accounts due to the collection of higher gas and other transportation taxes produced by the strong economy 
these drivers should provide the company with increasing bid opportunities during the coming year 
in october  president clinton signed into law legislation that appropriated billion for the federal aid highway programs for the fiscal year 
this marks a increase from the billion budgeted in and is in line with the authorized amounts set by tea the recently proposed budget also requests a record billion in federal highway administration obligations  up another from these amounts reflect the increase over tea s predecessor  the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act istea  along with the nation s commitment to improve roads and highways throughout the us as was the case with istea  there is typically a lag before companies like granite feel the bill s effects on the bottom line 
this lag is primarily a result of the length of time that it takes federal money to progress from planning to design to actual construction bids 
it is also important to note that granite does not recognize profits on a job until it is complete and therefore does not anticipate any significant impact to earnings from the larger tea funded projects until later in and beyond 
our public sector business should also be bolstered from increased airport construction spending 
legislators have approved a three year reauthorization of the federal aviation administration and airport improvement program aip 
the bill guarantees that aviation trust fund revenues and interest will be spent for capital improvements 
aip funding will be a minimum of billion to billion for each of the next three years more than increase over the billion appropriated in momentum in the private sector construction markets also appears to be carrying over into according to the us department of commerce  construction spending in january has surged to an all time high monthly level  led in part by spending on housing  commercial buildings and government projects 
despite rising interest rates  spending on residential projects rose while spending on new single family homes grew by 
granite has witnessed the growth in the private sector market as illustrated by the compounded average growth rate in its private sector revenue since in association with the strong economy  the company has witnessed some upward pressure on costs associated with rising oil prices and tight labor markets 
however  there has not been any significant impact on the company in due to the nature of granite s turn business  we are able to adjust prices fairly quickly allowing a level of protection against these fluctuating  or currently rising  costs 
in addition  certain costs such as diesel and asphalt oil are indexed in contracts for state funded projects in nevada 
similarly in california  asphalt oil is indexed in contracts for the california department of transportation caltrans 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to mitigate of the impact 
the heavy construction division hcd also has some excellent near term bidding opportunities to add to its quality backlog 
many of the projects will be let as design build contracts a more innovative form of project delivery for which granite has emerged as an industry leader 
the current list of targeted projects includes various highway and transit rail projects exceeding billion 
this list includes the las vegas monorail project  the legacy highway project in utah  the billion i se corridor project in colorado  light rail projects in florida and california and several other large highway projects in arizona  texas  california  utah  florida and massachusetts 
in florida  governor bush proposed his billion mobility initiative 
this plan would accelerate top priority projects on the florida intrastate highway system with no increase in taxes 
under mobility  projects that were originally planned over the next years would be built within the next ten years or sooner 
funding for the governor s plan would come from transportation related revenues  tea and short term bonds 
the program is expected to speed up improvements to interstates  and the company s branch division also anticipates a healthy bidding environment and strong demand for its construction services including aggregate material products as a result of robust public and private sector markets 
according to a press release by the nevada department of transportation dot  state highway expenditures in their state are expected to reach a record million in fiscal year in texas and florida  dot officials report that lettings in will be approximately billion and billion respectively 
although caltrans advertising schedule for totals over billion  officials estimate that it will let out to bid approximately billion worth of work this year in line with the approximate billion let in on the political front  we will be heavily involved in supporting the contracting out initiative on the november ballot in california 
sponsored by the consulting engineers and land surveyors of california celsoc  the initiative  if passed  would change the constitution to give state and local entities more freedom to contract with private entities for engineering and architectural services on public works projects 
it is our belief that current restrictions on these public agencies have created a significant bottleneck within the project pipeline thereby causing considerable delays on many projects  for which there is strong need and funding available 
further in california  sca a constitutional amendment which would have renewed expiring county half cent sales taxes for transportation purposes with a simple majority will not be placed on the ballot by the legislature in the near term 
a long term fix for county and statewide transportation funding in california is very fluid at this point in time  with a number of proposals currently being debated in sacramento 
the attention on this issue by state politicians reflects the public s demand that solutions should be put in place to deal with state s traffic problems 
the company will have more to say on this issue once a definitive plan has been formulated 
going forward  we are very pleased with the success of our current operations and the substantial bidding opportunities ahead 
we will continue to proactively work the m a process in our industry to find those acquisition candidates that offer good value by which to grow the company externally 
at the same time  we will follow our strategic initiatives to create continued internal organic growth 
we have set out aggressive growth goals for the to year period ahead because we believe that our strategic plans and favorable external market factors will provide better than normal opportunities in the continued effort to improve upon what has been a record financial performance in both divisions 
prior years in thousands increase revenue branch division heavy construction division revenue and backlog 
revenue from private sector contracts increased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in the majority of the growth in revenue from private sector contracts occurred in the branch division  where growth in residential and commercial construction created strong demand for site preparation projects 
in california  one of the company s largest markets  new building construction increased during to billion from billion in  according to the construction industry research board 
this trend also had a positive impact on material sales which increased during the branch division revenue was also positively impacted by contributions made from flood related emergency work caused by severe winter weather conditions 
the company s revenue from public sector contracts increased to million in from million in while decreasing to of the company s total revenue in from in the growth in hcd revenue was primarily in the public sector and reflected increased revenue from hcd s portion of the company s interstate rebuild project in utah and various projects added to backlog in the company s backlog at december  was million  down million  or from the relatively flat backlog in reflected new awards which offset a reduction due to a full year s work on the company s share of the i corridor reconstruction project in salt lake city  utah which was awarded in the first quarter of work on our million portion of the contract began during the second quarter of and was approximately complete at the end of gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit reached million  a million increase from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased in to from in the increased gross profit margin was attributable to the continued favorable market conditions  particularly in the private sector as described above  which tends to increase the company s ability to win competitively bid projects at higher margins 
project to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under general above  the company recognizes revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
during  the company s gross profit margins were positively impacted by the i corridor reconstruction project which reached the completion threshold in the second quarter 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs  equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs and insurance costs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  the company s gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december  and general and administrative expenses comprised the following in thousands in thousands salaries and related expenses   incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and pension   other general and administrative expenses   total   percent of revenue salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support the company s current and expected growth 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs increased in over as a function of the company s increased profitability 
other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support its operations  none of which exceeds of total general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflected increases in other costs to support the company s growth offset by the collection of a previously written off bad debt 
the decrease as a percent of revenue is due to the fixed nature of certain expenses and higher revenue from non sponsored joint venture contracts which do not create a corresponding level of administrative expense 
operating income 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased over the contribution due primarily to improved market conditions which increased both the volume of work and the profit margins the division was able to achieve 
the heavy construction division s contribution to operating income also increased in  primarily due to the impact of the i project reaching the completion threshold for profit recognition as described above 
other income expenses 
other income decreased million to million in the decrease was due to an increase in interest expense resulting from additional borrowings under long term debt agreements and lower gain on sale of property and equipment which was partially offset by higher interest income due to higher short term investments and cash and cash equivalents 
provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in  an increase of from the increase was primarily due to a lower impact of the company s percentage depletion deduction due to higher pre tax earnings 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   capital expenditures    working capital    during the company generated cash and cash equivalents from operating activities of million which represented an increase of million over this increase was due primarily to the company s increase in net income of million or  as well as increases in noncash adjustments primarily depreciation and amortization and the adjustment to net income from the company s equity in loss of affiliates 
the increased depreciation and amortization is due to increases in property and equipment balances and the equity in loss of affiliates relates primarily to the company s equity in tic s loss 
these increases were partially offset by a higher level of accounts receivable at december  which related to increased revenue  particularly in the fourth quarter 
cash used by investing activities in decreased million from due primarily to a net decrease in short term investments which was partially offset by increased additions to property and equipment to support the company s current and expected growth 
cash used by financing activities in increased million from due to the lack of additions to long term debt as well as the company s repurchase of its shares and increased dividend payments 
on march   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase  at management s discretion  up to million of its common stock on the open market  exclusive of repurchases related to employee benefit plans 
this authorization amends an authorization previously made in march of through march  the company has repurchased  shares for a total purchase price of million 
the remaining amount authorized of million equates to  shares using the closing market price of on march  the company has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
the company anticipates that cash generated internally and amounts available under its existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its capital and other requirements  including contributions to employee benefit plans  for the foreseeable future 
the company believes it has adequate capital resources to fund its operations at least through the company s consolidated working capital position was million at december  compared to million at december  the company currently has access to funds under its revolving credit agreement which allow it to borrow up to million  of which million was available at december  subsequent events 
on january   the board of directors declared a special dividend of per share of common stock in addition to a per share quarterly dividend  payable on april  to stockholders of record as of march  the quarterly dividend represents a per share increase over the dividends paid in of per share 
in january  the company purchased of the common stock of wilder construction company wilder for a purchase price of million 
the purchase agreement provides for the company to increase its ownership in wilder to between and in and to in founded in  wilder is a heavy civil construction company with regional offices located in washington  oregon and alaska 
wilder has annual revenues of approximately million and employs approximately people throughout the northwest and alaska 
the company currently holds a minority interest in tic holdings  inc tic 
in february  the company reached an agreement in principle with tic to sell its minority interest back to tic over a three and one half year period 
under the agreement in principle  tic will have the opportunity to repurchase shares sooner based on an agreed to formula 
a definitive agreement has not yet been finalized 
this will allow tic to retain its independence while allowing both companies to maintain their strategic alliance 
the proposed agreement will also allow the company to intensify its focus on its core business in heavy civil construction 
impact of the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the issue arises if date sensitive software recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
during the company completed its process which addressed year readiness of its systems and completed its process of identifying and making inquiries of its significant suppliers and large public and private sector customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
the company has not experienced any significant interruption in work or cash flow related to the date change to the year  either from its own information systems or those of significant third parties with whom the company does business 
the company believes that the risk of significant business interruption due to unanticipated problems with its own systems or the systems of significant third parties is low based on our experience to date 
in the unlikely event that unforeseen year related internal disruptions occur  the company believes that its existing disaster recovery program  which includes the manual processing of certain key transactions  would significantly mitigate the impact 
the company s costs to address the year issue were approximately  all of which were incurred during these costs included consulting fees and costs to remediate or replace hardware and software as well as non incremental costs resulting from redeployment of internal resources 
the company s year efforts did not have a significant impact on other information technology projects
