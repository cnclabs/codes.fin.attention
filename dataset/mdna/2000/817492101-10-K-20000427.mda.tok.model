overview serena software is an industry leading supplier of ebusiness infrastructure change management solutions 
serena was founded in and we introduced our first scm product  comparex  in since then  serena has developed a full suite of full 
cycle mainframe products  including our flagship product change man  which was introduced in in june  serena introduced echange man  a distributed systems product providing an end to end solution to scm across the enterprise from the mainframe to the desktop to the web 
it managers use our products to track software changes during the software application design and development process  manage separate programming teams that are concurrently developing and enhancing applications  and oversee the deployment of the software applications across both the mainframe and distributed systems environments 
on june   we acquired diamond optimum systems diamond  a provider of enterprise scm solutions for the web  nt  and unix environments 
this acquisition accelerated the development and introduction of our distributed systems product offerings and allowed us to provide scm solutions across the enterprise from the mainframe to unix nt servers to the web 
the diamond acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of diamond are included in serena s historical results after the acquisition date 
serena has grown rapidly in recent years as total revenue has increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in total revenue has been primarily attributable to increased demand for our full 
cycle mainframe products  and to a lesser extent in the most recent fiscal year  the introduction of our distributed systems product  echange man  into the marketplace 
in general  demand is increasing as a result of greater awareness of and need for automated third party scm solutions 
we derive our revenue from software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
currently  the majority of our software license revenue is derived from our full 
cycle mainframe products 
customers typically purchase the full 
cycle mainframe products under million instructions per second  or mips based  perpetual licenses 
mainframe software products and applications are usually priced based on hardware computing capacity 
mips is a capacity measurement used by hardware manufacturers to rate computer size to determine the amount of capacity for running applications and supporting users 
the higher a hardware s mips capacity  the more expensive a software license will be 
customers increasing their mips capacity are required to purchase an additional software license when upgrading the hardware 
software products are also typically priced based on a perpetual license agreement  which entitles a customer to use the product on an ongoing basis 
initial license transactions generally include one year of software maintenance and support 
revenue from license agreements  excluding maintenance revenue included with the license  is recognized upon receipt and acceptance of a signed contract and delivery of the software  provided the related fee is fixed  determinable and does not involve an extended payment term  collectibility of the revenue is probable and the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software 
in fiscal  and  sales of change man  comparex and startool together accounted for approximately  and of serena s software license revenue  respectively 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our full 
cycle mainframe or distributed systems products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our full 
cycle mainframe products for our revenue and our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes 
we also provide ongoing maintenance  which includes technical support  version upgrades and enhancements  for an annual fee of approximately of the current list price of the licensed product 
we recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the contracts  typically one year  on a straight line basis 
professional services revenue is derived from our ser power consulting and educational services  including implementation and integration of licensed software  specialized consulting services such as best practices design  development and deployment of scm solutions  and education courses for serena s products 
our professional services are typically billed on a time and materials basis and revenue is recognized as the related services are performed 
historically  serena s revenue has primarily been attributable to sales in north america 
in fiscal  and  revenue attributable to sales in north america accounted for approximately  and of serena s total revenue  respectively 
our plan is to expand our international operations significantly  particularly in europe  as we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
consequently  we anticipate that international revenue will increase as a percentage of total revenue in the future 
our expansion of our international operations will be subject to a variety of risks that could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business 
in north america  serena s revenue is generally denominated in united states dollars while international sales are generally denominated in local currencies  principally the british pound and german deutsche mark 
as serena s international sales and operations expand  we anticipate that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
see factors that may affect future results fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena 
maintenance revenue and professional services revenue have lower gross profit margins than software license revenue 
in addition  we license the technology for our startool and starwarp products and jointly own the technology for our detect resolve mainframe product and consequently we have sublicense fee obligations on the revenue we recognize in connection with license and maintenance transactions involving these products 
as a result  our license revenue for our startool  starwarp and detect resolve mainframe products has a lower gross profit margin than license revenue from other products 
we expect operating expenses to increase substantially in the future as we continue to develop new and enhanced versions of our products  including our distributed systems product suite  increase our sales and marketing activities  expand our distribution channels  increase our professional services capabilities and pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
any failure by serena to significantly increase revenue as we implement these initiatives could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition 
historical results of operations the following table sets forth the historical results of operations for serena expressed as a percentage of total revenue and are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
historical results include the results of optima from september   and diamond from june   the acquisition dates 
percentage of revenue fiscal year ended january  revenue software licenses maintenance professional services total revenue cost of revenue software licenses maintenance professional services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income comparison of fiscal years ended january   and revenue serena s total revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a increase from fiscal to and from fiscal to software licenses 
software licenses revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
software licenses revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are generally attributed to increased demand for new licenses of full 
cycle mainframe products as a result of greater customer awareness of and need for third party scm solutions and  to a lesser extent  an increase in sales force productivity and personnel  the introduction of our distributed systems product  echange man in the second half of fiscal  and software license price increases 
in particular  sales of our change man  comparex  and startool products grew significantly 
combined  they accounted for million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total software licenses revenue  respectively 
the company expects that its distributed systems revenues will increase  but that change man  comparex  and startool will continue to account for a substantial portion of software license revenue in the future 
maintenance 
maintenance revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases reflect both growth in software licenses revenue  as new licenses generally include one year of maintenance  renewals of maintenance agreements by existing customers and  to a lesser extent  maintenance price increases 
professional services 
professional services revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
professional services revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are attributable to greater consulting opportunities resulting from our larger installed customer base and our expanded consulting service capabilities 
the acquisition of optima on september  contributed million in additional professional services revenue in fiscal  or of the total million increase in professional service revenue in fiscal over the rate of growth was smaller in fiscal when compared to fiscal predominantly due to certain of our customers putting projects on hold in calendar in order to address their remediation  testing and other activities associated with becoming year compliant 
cost of revenue cost of revenue  which consists of cost of software licenses  cost of maintenance and cost of professional services  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are due primarily to increased expenses associated with professional services revenue and maintenance revenue  including personnel additions to support professional services and maintenance revenue growth  and software sublicense fees 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was a result of the growth in higher margin software licenses exceeding the other categories of revenue 
software licenses 
cost of software licenses consists principally of sublicense fees associated with our startool  starwarp and detect resolve mainframe products 
cost of software licenses was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total software licenses revenue  respectively 
cost of software licenses increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the increase in cost of software licenses as a percentage of total software licenses revenue in fiscal over is attributable to the increase in royalty bearing software licenses 
royalty bearing software licenses represented  and of total software license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with our customer support organizations  and to a lesser extent  sublicense fees associated with our startool  starwarp and detect resolve mainframe products 
cost of maintenance was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total maintenance revenue  respectively 
cost of maintenance increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are predominately due to increased expenses associated with our customer support organization including personnel additions needed to support the maintenance revenue growth and  to a lesser extent  increases in sublicense fees 
sublicense fees are paid to owners of third party products for providing maintenance enhancements and code fixes 
cost of maintenance as a percentage of total maintenance revenue has decreased as the rate of increase in maintenance revenue has been greater than the rate of increase in costs associated with our customer support organization 
professional services 
cost of professional services consists of salaries  bonuses and other costs associated with supporting our professional services organization 
cost of professional services was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total professional services revenue  respectively 
cost of professional services increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases are predominately due to increased expenses associated with our professional services organization including personnel additions and other infrastructure costs needed to support the professional services revenue growth 
prior to fiscal and as a percentage of total services revenue  cost of professional services had been increasing as we expanded our consulting organization 
in fiscal  however  cost of professional services as a percentage of total services revenue decreased from the prior year 
although costs of professional services increased in absolute dollar terms  it decreased as a percentage of revenue due in part to reducing the use of outside independent contractors and reallocating professional services resources to other parts of our organization 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  payroll taxes  profit sharing expenses in fiscal only and employee benefits as well as travel  entertainment and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases in each fiscal year and the percentage of total revenue increase in fiscal over are due primarily to the expansion of our direct sales and marketing organizations which began in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  the development of our international sales and telesales efforts 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained unchanged in fiscal  when compared the prior year  as the rate of increase in revenues offset the costs of our continued expansion of the sales and marketing organizations 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire additional sales and marketing personnel and market our distributed systems products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  profit sharing expenses in fiscal only and employee benefits and costs attributable to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased million or from fiscal to and increased million or from fiscal to the dollar decrease in fiscal from is attributable principally to the restructuring of compensation arrangements with serena s founder and chief technology officer 
the dollar increase in fiscal from was primarily due to increases in salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  employee benefits and other headcount related costs which resulted from a increase in headcount  primarily associated with the company s acquisition of diamond in june  and to a lesser extent  increases in infrastructure costs also associated with the acquisition 
prior to fiscal  the company s development efforts were primarily focused in the mainframe market and with the acquisition of diamond  the company s development efforts have expanded to other platforms  including the web  unix  nt and other distributed system platforms 
we expect research and development expenses to increase both in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to hire additional research and development personnel to develop our distributed systems product suite and integrate our existing products using sernet 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  profit sharing expenses in fiscal only and benefits and certain non allocable administrative costs  including legal and accounting fees and bad debts 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from fiscal to and million or from fiscal to the dollar increases in each fiscal year are primarily due to salary  bonus  payroll tax and employee benefit costs associated with the expansion of our administrative infrastructure in order to support our increased sales  marketing  professional services and maintenance activities  and to a lesser extent in fiscal  costs associated with being a public company 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue is principally attributable to serena s revenue growth during this period 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms as we expand our infrastructure and our operations 
stock based compensation 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  serena recorded aggregate deferred stock based compensation of million in connection with the issuance of restricted stock and grant of options to purchase common stock in january an additional million of deferred stock based compensation was recorded in fiscal for stock based awards granted during this period 
no deferred stock based compensation was recorded in fiscal deferred stock based compensation is generally being amortized over the to month vesting periods of the related awards 
this amortization is being recorded in a manner consistent with fasb interpretation no 
of the total deferred stock based compensation  million  million and million was amortized in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to amortize an additional million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena 
amortization of intangible assets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  serena recorded intangible assets of million in connection with the acquisition of optima in september the intangible assets are being amortized over periods of one year or less on million and fifteen years on the remaining million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded intangible assets of million in connection with the acquisition of diamond in june of the total intangible assets  million and million was amortized in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect to amortize an additional million in each of the next two fiscal years  fiscal and intangible assets will be fully amortized in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the company s acquisition of diamond in june  the company took a one time charge of million for acquired in process research and development 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of serena 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the dollar increases in interest and other income  net is generally due to increases in balances on interest bearing accounts  such as cash and cash equivalents  and both short and long term investments  resulting from accumulation of earnings 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was predominantly the direct result of the company s initial public offering in february which generated net proceeds to the company totaling million and million in february and march  respectively 
income taxes income taxes 
income taxes were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing effective income tax rates of  and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate increased in fiscal over predominantly due to the million in nondeductible charges recorded in fiscal which consisted of million in stock based compensation and million in amortization of intangible assets arising from the optima acquisition as compared to million in nondeductible stock based compensation recorded in fiscal the company s effective income tax rate decreased slightly in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  as the rate of growth in pretax profits was greater than the rate of growth in nondeductible charges 
in fiscal  the company recorded million in nondeductible charges consisting of million in stock based compensation  million in amortization of intangible assets arising from the optima and diamond acquisitions and million as a one time charge for acquired in process research and development also arising from the diamond acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal serena s effective income tax rate has historically benefited from the united states research and experimentation tax credit and tax benefits generated from export sales made from the united states 
liquidity and capital resources since serena s inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations 
as of january   serena had million in cash and cash equivalents  and an additional million and million in short term and long term investments  respectively  consisting principally of high grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and short term bonds 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
serena s cash flows provided by operating activities exceeded net income during each of these periods principally due to cash collections in advance of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts  the inclusion of non cash expenses in net income and growth in accrued expenses and corporate taxes payable  all partially offset by growth in accounts receivable and net deferred tax assets during the periods 
non cash expenses included in net income consisted of amortization of deferred stock based compensation for all periods  amortization of intangible assets in fiscal and only  and a one time charge in fiscal for acquired in process research and development 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities were predominantly related to the purchase of short and long term investments totaling million  and cash paid in connection with the diamond acquisition in june  net of cash received totaling million 
predominantly in fiscal and  and to a lesser extent in fiscal  cash used in investing activities were related to the purchase of computer equipment and office furniture and equipment totaling million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in financing activities related to the repurchase of million in common stock in fiscal from a resigning executive officer of serena and the repayment of million of notes payable assumed in the acquisition of optima in fiscal see item certain relationships and related transactions 
there was no cash provided by financing activities in fiscal or cash provided by financing activities in fiscal predominantly related to the company s initial public offering in february  the sale of the company s common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options under the company s employee stock option plan  all of which generated cash totaling million net of ipo costs  million and million  respectively 
at january   serena did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures and has no revolving credit agreement or other term loan agreements with any bank or other financial institution 
at january   serena had working capital of million and accounts receivable  net of allowances  of million 
total deferred revenue increased to million at january  from million at january  primarily as a result of increased billings of maintenance fees 
we believe that the net proceeds from the offering and cash from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements the fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under sfas no 
 entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  the reason for holding it 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments 
therefore  the company does not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial statements 
year compliance many computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
in the ordinary course of our business  we test and evaluate our software products 
we believe that our software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not materially affect the performance of such software products or the ability of such products to correctly create  store  process and output information of data involving dates 
we have not observed any material year related problems with our business or products to date 
factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including but not limited to  our reliance on our mainframe products for revenue  changes in revenue mix and seasonality  our ability to deliver our products on the distributed systems platform  dependence on revenues from our installed base  expansion of our professional services and international organizations  our ability to manage our growth and the following there are many factors  including some beyond our control  that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results have varied greatly in the past and may vary greatly in the future depending upon a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this factors that may affect future results section of this report  including many that are beyond our control 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
our software license revenue in any quarter depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  our revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and could impair our business in future periods 
because we do not know when  or if  our potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict our revenue and operating results for future quarters 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been attributable to the licenses of our full 
cycle mainframe software products 
changes in the mix of software products and services sold by us  including the mix between higher margin software products and lower margin maintenance and services  could materially affect our operating results for future quarters as could the percentage of software products sold which require us to pay a sublicense fee to a third party 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products may affect our quarterly operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonality in sales of our software products 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending january are typically higher relative to our other quarters  because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements 
in addition  our january quarter tends to reflect the effect of the incentive compensation structure for our sales organization  which is based on satisfaction of fiscal year end quotas 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
we are also currently attempting to expand our presence in international markets  particularly in europe 
we expect our quarter ending october to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year  particularly in europe 
to the extent that our revenue in europe or other parts of the world increase in future periods  we expect our period to period revenues to reflect any seasonal buying patterns in these markets 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future and these increased expenses may adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition although serena has been profitable in recent years  we may not remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our united states and international direct sales forces and extending our telesales efforts develop our technology  including our distributed systems scm products broaden our professional services offerings and delivery capabilities expand our distribution channels pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions with these additional expenses  in order to maintain our current levels of profitability  we will be required to increase our revenue correspondingly 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue as we implement our product  service and distribution strategies would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
although our revenue has grown in recent years  we do not believe that we will maintain this rate of revenue growth 
in addition  we may not experience any revenue growth in the future  and our revenue could in fact decline 
our efforts to expand our software product suites  sales and marketing activities  direct and indirect distribution channels and professional service offerings and to pursue strategic relationships or acquisitions may not succeed or may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate 
as a result  we cannot predict our future operating results with any degree of certainty 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customers renewing maintenance agreements for our products and licensing additional serena scm products  our future professional service and maintenance revenue is dependent on future sales of our software products we depend on our installed customer base for future revenues from maintenance renewal fees and licenses of additional scm products 
if our customers do not purchase additional products or cancel or fail to renew their maintenance agreements  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
the terms of our standard license arrangements provide for a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of software maintenance and support fees 
the maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  our current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  our customers may not necessarily purchase additional products  upgrades or professional services 
our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue are also dependent upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in our software license revenue would have a negative impact on the growth of our professional service revenue and maintenance revenue in future quarters 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our full 
cycle mainframe products for our revenue historically  the majority of our software license revenue has resulted from the sale of our full 
cycle mainframe products 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of our full 
cycle mainframe products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
in particular  change man and comparex  two of our full 
cycle mainframe products  have been responsible for a substantial majority of our revenue 
in fiscal  and  sales of change man and comparex together accounted for approximately  and of our software license revenue  respectively 
we expect that these products will continue to account for a large portion of our software license revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future operating results depend on the continued market acceptance of our full 
cycle mainframe products  including future enhancements 
our introduction of serena scm products for distributed systems may not be successful we introduced our echange man product in fiscal and are currently developing our product suite to support distributed systems platforms 
if we do not successfully develop  market  sell and support our distributed systems products  this would materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
historically  the majority of our products have been designed for the mainframe platform  and the majority of our software license revenue  maintenance revenue and professional services revenue to date have been attributable to licenses for these mainframe products 
we do not have experience developing  marketing  selling or supporting distributed systems products 
developing  marketing and selling our distributed systems products will require significant resources that we may not have 
our sales and marketing organizations have historically focused exclusively on sales of our products for the mainframe and have limited experience marketing and selling distributed systems products 
additionally  we do not have any experience in providing support services for distributed systems products 
competition for experienced software engineers  sales personnel and support staff is intense and if we fail to attract qualified personnel this would impair our ability to support our distributed systems products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater experience providing distributed systems compatible software products than we do  and many also have significantly greater financial and organizational resources 
if the scm market does not evolve as we anticipate  our business will be adversely affected if we fail to properly assess and address the scm market or if our products and services fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business and quarterly and annual operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the scm market is in an early stage of development 
it organizations have traditionally addressed scm needs internally and have only recently become aware of the benefits of third party scm solutions as their scm requirements have become more complex 
since the market for our products is still evolving  it is difficult to assess the competitive environment or the size of the market that may develop 
our future financial performance will depend in large part on the continued growth in the number of businesses adopting third party scm products and the expansion of their use on a company wide basis 
the scm market for third party products may grow more slowly than we anticipate 
in addition  technologies  customer requirements and industry standards may change rapidly 
if we cannot improve or augment our products as rapidly as existing technologies  customer requirements and industry standards evolve  our products or services could become obsolete 
the introduction of new or technologically superior products by competitors could also make our products less competitive or obsolete 
as a result of any of these factors  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded 
our business is dependent on the continued market for ibm and ibm compatible mainframes we are substantially dependent upon the continued use and acceptance of ibm and ibm compatible mainframes and the growth of this market 
if the role of the mainframe does not increase as we anticipate  or if it in any way decreases  this would materially adversely affect our business  future quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
additionally  if there is a wide acceptance of other platforms or if new platforms emerge that provide enhanced enterprise server capabilities  our business and future operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the majority of our software license revenue to date has been attributable to sales of our full 
cycle mainframe products 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  the majority of our software license revenue will continue to come from sales of our mainframe products 
as a result  future sales of our existing products and associated maintenance revenue and professional service revenue will depend on continued use of mainframes 
we may experience delays in developing our products which could adversely affect our business if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
we have experienced product development delays in new version and update releases in the past and may experience similar or more significant product delays in the future 
to date  none of these delays has materially affected our business 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products or the delivery of new versions of our products to our customers 
in particular  we may experience delays in introducing our distributed systems product suite 
any delay in releasing our new distributed systems products  for whatever reason  would impair our revenue growth 
we have experienced significant growth in our business in recent periods and our ability to manage this growth and any future growth will affect our business our ability to compete effectively and to manage our recent growth  any future growth and our future quarterly and annual operating results will depend in part on our ability to implement and expand operational  customer support and financial control systems and to hire  train and manage our employees 
we may not be able to augment or improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to future growth  if any 
any failure to manage growth could materially adversely affect our business 
our business has grown substantially in recent years  with total revenue increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in connection with this revenue growth  beginning in fiscal and continuing in fiscal and  we began a strategic expansion of our sales  marketing and professional service activities 
this expansion included our september acquisition of optima which significantly increased the size of our sales  marketing and professional service organizations and our june acquisition of diamond which expanded our research and development organization 
this growth has resulted  and any future growth will result  in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and such officers and key personnel may not remain with serena in the future our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior executives and certain other key employees  including certain sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
if we lost the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with serena  this could materially adversely affect our business 
in particular  we have historically relied on the experience and dedication of our product authors 
with the exception of douglas d 
troxel  serena s founder  chief technology officer and chairman of serena s board of directors  the employment of all of our senior and key employees  including key product authors  is at will 
mr 
troxel s employment is on a year to year basis 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
we intend to expand our international operations and may encounter a number of problems in doing so  there are also a number of factors associated with international operations that could adversely affect our business expansion of international operations 
we intend to expand the scope of our international operations and currently have subsidiaries in the united kingdom and in germany 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  this could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
our continued growth and profitability will require continued expansion of our international operations  particularly in europe 
we intend to open additional international offices 
we have only limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products internationally 
additionally  we do not have any experience in developing foreign language versions of our products 
such development may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
risks of international operations 
international sales represented approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
our international revenue is attributable principally to our european operations 
our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations problems in collecting accounts receivable longer payment cycles fluctuations in currency exchange rates seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world recessionary environments in foreign economies increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for serena a majority of our international business is conducted in foreign currencies  principally the british pound and the german deutsche mark 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause variability in our international business profitability 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future quarterly and annual operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect serena from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
serena is subject to intense competition in the scm industry and we expect to face increased competition in the future  including competition in the scm distributed systems market we may not be able to compete successfully against current and or future competitors and such inability would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
moreover  the technology for scm products may change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced  and existing products are continually enhanced 
competition may also result in changes in pricing policies by serena or our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
mainframe competition 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including customers internal it departments providers of scm products that compete directly with change man and comparex such as computer associates  merant  ibm and smaller private companies providers of scm application development programmer productivity and system management products such as compuware  ibm and smaller private companies future competition 
we may face competition in the future from established companies who have not previously entered the mainframe scm market or from emerging software companies 
barriers to entry in the software market are relatively low 
increased competition may materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results due to price reductions  reduced gross margins and reduction in market share 
established companies may not only develop their own mainframe scm solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors  including cooperative relationships between large  established companies and smaller private companies 
because larger companies have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the mainframe scm market through acquisitions or strategic relationships and may be able to leverage the technology and expertise of smaller companies and develop successful scm products for the mainframe 
we expect that the software industry  in general  and providers of scm solutions  in particular  will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
bundling or compatibility risks 
our ability to sell our products also depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  particularly those provided by ibm 
developers of these third party products may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
these third party developers may also decide to bundle their products with other scm products for promotional purposes 
if that were to happen  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results may be materially adversely affected as we may be priced out of the market or no longer be able to offer commercially viable products 
competition in the distributed systems scm market 
we also face significant competition as we develop  market and sell our distributed systems products  including echange man 
if we are unable to successfully penetrate the distributed systems scm market  our business and future quarterly and annual operating results will be materially adversely affected 
penetrating the existing distributed systems scm market will be difficult 
competitors in the distributed systems market include rational software  computer associates  continuus  merant  microsoft  novadigm  novell  and other smaller private companies 
certain of our products are licensed from third parties or are jointly owned with third parties  our failure to maintain these arrangements with third parties could adversely affect our business startool and starwarp 
we license our startool and starwarp products on an exclusive worldwide basis from a 
bruce leland  one of our employees 
the termination of our licenses for the startool or starwarp products could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly and annual operating results 
mr 
leland holds all proprietary rights with respect to the startool and starwarp technology  including any derivative works or enhancements of the existing startool and starwarp products 
our licenses for these products are terminable by mr 
leland upon days notice in the event certain conditions occur  including our failure to pay sublicense fees to mr 
leland on a timely basis or any other material breach by us of the license agreement 
should the licenses for the startool and starwarp products terminate  we may not be able to replace these products which could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
licenses of startool accounted for  and of our total software license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
licenses of starwarp accounted for  and of our total software license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
for a description of our license agreements for the startool and starwarp products  see business intellectual property 
detect resolve mainframe 
we share ownership rights in our detect resolve mainframe technology for mainframe platforms with high power software 
although we have historically had primary responsibility for marketing  licensing and supporting detect resolve mainframe  high power software has the ability to jointly direct these efforts 
if in the future we are unable to reach agreement with high power software on the direction or evolution of the product  our ability to market or promote the product may be compromised 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
sales of detect resolve mainframe accounted for  and of our total software license revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
for a description of rights associated with our joint ownership of the detect resolve mainframe technology for the mainframe see business intellectual property 
third parties in the future could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our business  there could be potential adverse effects of the pending compuware claim third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
any claims of this type could affect our relationships with existing customers and may prevent future customers from licensing our products 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of products  any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
as a result of these factors  infringement claims could materially adversely affect our business 
in september  compuware filed suit against serena in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan seeking unspecified compensatory damages  costs and attorneys fees  and injunctive relief based on allegations of copyright infringement  trade secret misappropriation and various tort claims related to the sale of our startool and starwarp products 
compuware served the complaint on serena in november as of the date of this statement  the parties have completed fact discovery 
to date  compuware has not sought preliminary injunctive relief 
however  management cannot ascertain the availability of injunctive relief or other equitable remedies or estimate the total expenses  possible damages or settlement value  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in connection with compuware s suit 
management believes  based on the advice of counsel  that serena has meritorious defenses to the allegations contained in compuware s complaint and management is defending against the complaint vigorously 
we believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
this litigation could be time consuming and costly  and there can be no assurance that serena will necessarily prevail given the inherent uncertainties in litigation 
in the event that we do not prevail in litigation  we could be prevented from selling our startool and starwarp products or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay monetary damages  and or pay attorneys fees 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to serena 
in the event of a successful claim against us  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our sales cycle typically takes six to months to complete and varies from product to product 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
additionally  the emerging market for scm products and services contributes to the lengthy sales process in that during the sales cycle we often have to teach potential customers about the use and benefits of our products 
in certain circumstances  we license our software to customers on a trial basis to assist the customers in their evaluation of our products 
our sales cycle can be further extended for product sales made through third party distributors 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced sales  technical  marketing and management personnel 
in addition  we will need to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified software engineers  as well as sales and marketing and support personnel  and successfully develop  market and support our distributed systems product suite which  excluding our echange man product  is currently in development 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially developers and sales personnel 
we expect competition for qualified personnel to remain intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining such personnel 
if we do not  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
this training will require substantial resources and management attention 
international operations 
we intend to expand the scope of our international operations and these plans will require us to attract experienced management  service  marketing  sales and support personnel for our international offices 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain such experienced personnel 
non us citizens working in the united states 
to achieve our business objectives  we may recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states  particularly the ukraine 
limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could materially adversely affect our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel 
this may have a material adverse effect on our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
we will need to expand our distribution channels in order to expand our business and a number of factors may hinder our ability to accomplish this goal if we fail to significantly expand our direct sales and telesales force  our ability to sell our products into new markets and to increase our product penetration into our existing markets will be impaired 
failure to expand our distribution channels through any of these means could materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
in addition  our ability to achieve revenue growth in future periods will be heavily dependent on our success in recruiting and training sufficient direct sales personnel 
we are planning to significantly expand our direct sales efforts in north america and europe and while we are investing  and plan to continue to invest  substantial resources on this expansion  we have at times experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified direct sales personnel 
in addition to expanding our direct sales efforts  we are also currently investing  and we intend to continue to invest  substantial resources in selling our products through telesales personnel 
we also intend to extend our distribution channels by partnering with leading helpdesk management  software distribution application and system framework providers and may also attempt to develop additional sales and marketing channels through system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other partners 
we will need to expand our professional services organization in order to expand our business and a number of factors may hinder our ability to accomplish this goal our existing professional services and customer support organizations may not be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business 
the failure to expand our professional services and customer support organizations could materially adversely affect our business 
while we intend to significantly expand our professional services and customer support organizations  including providing these services for both distributed systems and mainframe applications and systems  we may not be able to do so 
competition for additional qualified technical personnel to perform these services is intense 
we believe that providing high quality consulting  training  customer support and education is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
if we are unable to provide comprehensive consulting and support services to our existing and prospective customers  this may materially adversely affect our business and ability to sell our products 
consulting services and customer support are critical to our future success because the market for third party scm solutions is still evolving  and many organizations have limited experience using third party scm solutions 
customers have only recently begun to look to third party providers for scm solutions as the complexity of computer networks and number of applications has increased 
our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technology standards and our future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
we expect that we will have to respond quickly to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products 
we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us because our software products are complex  they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software  we expect that errors in our products will continue to be found in the future 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  certain of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
these problems could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
in the past we have discovered errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in the shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
these delays have principally related to new version and product update releases 
to date none of these delays have materially affected our business 
however  product errors or delays in the future  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of our distributed systems products  could be material 
in addition  in certain cases we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to such specifications  customers could demand a refund for the software license fee paid to us or assert claims for damages 
product liability claims asserted against us in the future could adversely affect our business we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
a material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
serena s standard software licenses provide that if our products fail to perform  we will correct or replace such products 
if these corrective measures fail  we may be required to refund the license fee for such non performing product 
however  our standard license agreement limits our liability for non performing products to the amount of license fee paid  if the license has been in effect for less than one year  or to the amount of the licensee s current annual maintenance fee  if the license is more than one year old 
our standard license also provides that serena shall not be liable for indirect or consequential damages caused by the failure of our products 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio and has no foreign exchange contracts 
its financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  trade accounts and contracts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
the company considers investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
all of the company s cash equivalents and short and long term investments  principally consist of commercial paper and debt securities  and are classified as available for sale as of january  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term investments and short term obligations  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
sales to foreign countries accounted for approximately of the total sales for fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
because the company invoices certain of its foreign sales in currencies other than the united states dollar  predominantly the british pound sterling and german deutsche mark  and does not hedge these transactions  fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect the translated results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  foreign exchange fluctuation could create a risk of significant balance sheet gains or losses on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  given the company s foreign subsidiaries net book values as of january  and net cash flows for the most recent fiscal year then ended  the company believes that such foreign denominated balances and activity are not material
