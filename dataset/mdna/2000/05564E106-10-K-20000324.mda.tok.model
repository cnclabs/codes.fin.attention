during and continuing in  the company substantially completed the strategic repositioning of its portfolio to concentrate on apartment communities and disposed of nearly all of its commercial and retail assets  which significantly reduced the revenues received from such properties in and at december   the company s portfolio of apartment communities consisted of the following i  units in communities that were completed and stabilized for all of and same store communities  see footnote on page  ii  units in stabilized communities that were acquired or stabilized in and held for all of and iii  units in six communities that were completed and leased up in revenues total revenues excluding net gain on sales of investments in rental properties were  in   in and  in revenues increased in primarily from the completion and lease up of six apartment communities and acquisitions of stabilized properties in  which were held for all of revenues increased in primarily as a result of revenues derived from stabilized apartment communities acquired in the transaction

commercial and retail revenues as a percentage of total revenues have declined in each of the last three years as a result of the company s strategy emphasizing redeployment of these investments into apartment communities

multifamily real estate expenses as a percentage of multifamily rental income decreased from in to in and to in although not measurable with precision  management believes that this decrease resulted in part from economies of scale derived from increased concentration of assets in the company s markets

the following table presents data with respect to the company s properties included in construction in progress and land under development at december   for both direct investment and equity interest properties 
completion of these properties is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including construction delays and cost overruns 
no assurance can be given that these properties will be completed or  if completed  that they will be completed by the estimated dates or for the estimated amounts or that they will contain the number of units proposed in the table below 
cost to date proposed december  estimated units total cost direct investment construction in progress   equity interests in joint venture construction in progress   subtotal    land under development  as of december   of these units had been delivered

the development plans for these communities are under review and finalization  including obtaining final bids for construction costs  and the total proposed units may change 
impact of inflation over of bre s total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment leases typically one year or less  the company may seek to adjust rents to mitigate the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  occupancy rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases that permit apartment residents to leave at the end of each lease term at minimal cost to the resident 
year considerations as of december   the company had completed a project that replaced portions of its software so that its computer systems would function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost for the company s systems was approximately  and such costs were expensed according to the company s existing policy 
the company completed the necessary software replacement largely using existing employees 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
as of march   the company has not experienced significant operational problems due to year issues 
further  the company believes that its risk for future operational problems related to the year issue is minimal 
the company is dependent on third parties to continue operating properly  and as of march   the company is unaware of any significant year issue preventing third parties with material dealings with the company to function normally 
however  as a component of its year project  the company has discussed year compliance issues with its key vendors and service providers  and has developed contingency plans  although there can be no assurance that these contingency plans will successfully avoid future service interruption 
due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issue and  in particular  the uncertainty regarding the compliance programs of third parties  no assurance can be given that these estimates will be achieved  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash totaled  up from  at the end of due to the excess of cash flow provided by operating and financing activities over cash flows used for investing activities  as follows net cash flows generated by operating activities increased by  from  for the year ended december   due primarily to higher net income in net cash flows generated by financing activities decreased by  from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the issuance in of senior unsecured notes and higher borrowings on the line of credit to fund construction in progress and acquisitions of stabilized properties 
net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by  from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the funding of construction in progress and acquisitions of stabilized properties 
borrowings under the company s line of credit totaled  at december   compared to  at december  drawings on the line of credit are available to pay dividends to shareholders and distributions to minority members  to fund capital improvements and operating expenses  and to fund property acquisitions and development 
the company typically reduces its outstanding balance on the line of credit with available cash balances 
borrowings of up to  are available under the company s line of credit  with  available at december  the line of credit matures in august and bears interest at the lower of libor plus or a rate based on bids of the participating banks 
cost of the line of credit is per annum on the total commitment amount 
the company had a total of  in unsecured indebtedness other than the line of credit at december   consisting of the following  of unsecured senior notes with an interest rate of per annum on  and per annum on  this indebtedness is to be repaid through scheduled principal payments annually from to  principal amount of unsecured senior notes due  with an effective interest rate of approximately  and  principal amount of unsecured notes due  with an effective interest rate of 
in addition  at december   the company had mortgage indebtedness totaling  at interest rates ranging from to  with remaining terms of from less than one to years 
for additional information regarding the company s line of credit  unsecured senior notes payable and mortgage loans payable  including scheduled principal payments over the next five years  see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s indebtedness contain financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt and total debt to capital  among others 
the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants during the year ended december the company purchased two completed apartment communities totaling units during the year ended december  for a gross purchase price of approximately  during this period  the company also purchased four land sites for development of an estimated  units  for a gross purchase price of approximately  further  the company funded approximately  for direct investment construction in progress and funded approximately  in costs in for construction in progress for communities under joint venture agreements 
these acquisition and construction costs were funded by borrowings on the line of credit  the issuance of preferred stock  construction loans on communities under joint venture agreements and proceeds from the sale of properties 
because of higher prices and corresponding declining rates of return on completed apartment communities in its targeted western markets  the company presently does not anticipate significant acquisitions of completed apartment communities in  other than the communities noted below 
the company continually evaluates its portfolio to determine whether acquisitions or dispositions may be appropriate to maximize the portfolio s performance 
the company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash balances and cash flows provided by operations  borrowings on the unsecured line of credit and to a lesser extent  proceeds from asset sales 
the company believes that its cash flow and cash available from its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs during  which include normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements  budgeted expenditures for improvements to certain properties  funding ongoing construction in progress and distributions required to maintain the company s real estate investment trust qualification under the code 
however  the company anticipates that it will continue to require outside sources of financing to meet its long term liquidity needs beyond  such as scheduled debt repayments  construction funding and property acquisitions 
at december   the company had committed to purchase two multifamily communities for approximately  estimated to fund in the year and had an estimated cost of  to complete existing direct investment construction in progress  and  net of construction financing and partners contributions to fund joint venture construction in progress  with funding estimated from to in addition  the estimated cost to complete land under development has not been determined as the development plans have not been finalized 
these properties may be contributed to a joint venture  which may significantly lower the company s required funding 
to facilitate the acquisition of public capital  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement in march providing for the issuance of up to million in equity  debt  preferred or convertible securities  of which approximately  remains unused at december  the company believes that public capital markets will not be  for the foreseeable future  as significant a source of funding as they have in the three years ended december  the company is actively searching for other sources of possible funding  including further joint ventures and additional secured construction debt 
the company owns unencumbered real estate assets that could be sold  contributed to joint ventures or used as collateral for financing purposes subject to certain lender restrictions and has encumbered assets with significant equity that could be further encumbered should other sources of capital not be available 
substantially all of the properties acquired in the transaction are held through bre property investors llc the operating company 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing the operations of the operating company the llc agreement  the nonmanaging members are entitled to receive certain distributions of cash prior to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s unsecured line of credit 
the company primarily enters into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the company continuously evaluates its level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company did not have any derivative financial instruments at december   but had in previous years 
in and  the company closed out treasury rate lock agreements in conjunction with the issuance of its million unsecured senior notes due  issued in june  and million unsecured senior notes due  issued in february the purpose of these treasury rate lock agreements was to obtain what the company considered advantageous pricing for future anticipated debt issuance 
the fair values of bre s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash  other assets  accounts payable and other liabilities and unsecured line of credit approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an interest rate similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
the fair value of the company s mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes approximates their carrying value at december  the company had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately  and  respectively  on the company s earnings and cash flows based on these year end debt levels 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to the company at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
