item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company s primary business is providing conveniently located branch offices to attract checking  money market  savings  and certificate of deposit accounts  and investing such deposits and other available funds in loans  primarily those secured by various types of real estate 
the bank s deposit gathering and lending markets are concentrated in the communities surrounding its eight full service branch offices located in santa cruz  northern monterey  and southern santa clara counties  in california 
the most significant component of the company s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest and dividend income  primarily from loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  and interest expense  primarily on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest income and net interest margin  which is defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  are affected by its asset growth and quality  its asset and liability composition  and the general interest rate environment 
the company s deposit service charges  mortgage loan servicing fees  and commissions from the sale of non fdic insured insurance products and investments through portola also have significant effects on the company s results of operations 
an additional major factor in determining the company s results of operations are general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of employee compensation  occupancy and equipment expenses  data and item processing fees  and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly absolute and relative levels and changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory agencies 
subsequent to the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s management determined that costs associated with shares purchased in and for future distribution under its stock award programs should have been recorded as a contra equity account rather than an asset 
furthermore  such shares were inappropriately included in the weighted average shares outstanding used in earnings per share calculations 
as a result  other assets and total stockholders equity as of december   and earnings per share for the years ended december  and  have been restated from amounts previously reported in order to conform with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition  prior years compensation expense was understated by a cumulative amount of approximately   net of tax or diluted earnings per share which is insignificant and has been charged to operations 
the effects of the restatement are presented in note to the consolidated financial statement 
interest rate environment the table below presents an overview of the interest rate environment during the three years ended december  market interest rates generally trended upward in  with an acceleration in the latter half of the year as the federal reserve implemented three separate basis point increases in its target federal funds rate 
the treasury yield curve also became steeper during  after starting the year with just a basis point yield differential between a three month treasury bill and a year treasury bond 
note that the th district cost of funds index cofi is by nature a lagging index that trails changes in more responsive interest rate indices such as those associated with the treasury or libor markets 
the significant rate decreases during the latter half of occurred as the federal reserve implemented three rounds of rate cuts in response to concerns regarding o economic performance by certain countries  particularly those located in asia o the potential impacts of financial difficulties by large hedge funds o the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to ensure smooth operation of the capital markets index month treasury bill month treasury bill year treasury bill year treasury note year treasury note year treasury bond prime rate cofi business strategy during  the company achieved progress in its business strategy of converting an almost year old savings and loan into an effective community based financial services company 
the objective of this business strategy is to increase long term shareholder returns while also enhancing the company s involvement in and contributions to the communities it serves 
the steps identified to achieve this objective include o increasing the company s ratio of loans to deposits as a means of enhancing net interest income  serving more customers  moderating exposure to change in general market interest rates  and better utilizing the company s capital resources 
o diversifying the product mix within the loan portfolio to reduce the historic high concentration in relatively commoditized residential mortgages while also meeting the financing needs of consumers and small businesses within the company s market areas 
o acquiring customers disaffected by the recent or pending acquisition of their financial services provider 
o capitalizing on the company s position as one of the largest independent financial institutions in the greater monterey bay area 
o bolstering non interest income from an expanding list of fee based products and services  including atm surcharges  deposit account and branch service charges  and sales of non fdic insured investment products including mutual funds and annuities 
o changing the company s deposit mix to emphasize transaction accounts as a means of cementing customer relationships  lower the company s relative cost of funds  generating fee income  and increasing the duration of the company s funding 
o capitalizing on the continued strength of the economy and real estate markets in the company s primary business areas  particularly through construction lending 
o continuing to aggressively manage the company s capital position  balancing opportunities for investment in the company s business with an ongoing pattern of share repurchases and dividend payments 
o pursuing alternative forms of delivery for financial products and services as a means of attracting a greater volume of business while also improving the company s efficiency ratio 
the company intends to continue pursuing this business strategy in  with specific goals of pursuing one or more additional remote atm sites  introducing internet based banking  and expanding the company s market coverage through either additional traditional  stand alone  full service branches or other alternatives  possibly including supermarket banking 
however  there can be no assurance that any such steps will be implemented  or if implemented  whether such steps will improve the company s financial performance 
analysis of results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview the company reported record net income of million for the twelve months ended december   up significantly from net income of million realized during the prior year 
these figures translate to basic and diluted earnings per share in  respectively  and basic and diluted earnings per share in  respectively 
the company s return on average assets improved from in to in due to the company s equity management program  return on average equity improved more dramatically  rising from in to in the increase in net income resulted from the company s continued progress and success in implementing its business strategy  complemented by a strong economy and vibrant local real estate markets  which helped constrain loan delinquencies  net charge offs  and expenses associated with foreclosed real estate 
net interest income during the years ended december    and  net interest income before the provision for estimated loan losses was million  million  and million  respectively 
the volume of average interest earning assets over the same years was million  million  and million  respectively 
the net interest spread was   and  respectively  during the years ended december    and during these same periods  the ratio of net interest income to average total assets was   and  respectively 
the million  or  increase in net interest income generated in versus the prior year was primarily produced by three key changes in the company s balance sheet composition on the asset side of the balance sheet  the company significantly redirected its asset mix towards loans receivable  reducing the proportion of the balance sheet comprised of lower yielding cash equivalents  investment securities  and mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable produced a weighted average yield rate of during  comparing quite favorably to on cash equivalents  on investment securities  and on mortgage backed securities 
this change in asset mix was enabled by a record loan origination volume of million accomplished in  primarily funded by the sale of securities and increased borrowings 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the company significantly reduced the percentage of deposits represented by relatively higher cost certificates in favor of a larger proportion of transaction accounts 
certificates of deposit  which generated a weighted average cost of in and in  declined from of average interest bearing deposits in to in the company successfully offset the decline in certificates of deposit with increases in lower cost checking and money market accounts 
by comparison  money market accounts produced an average cost of funds of in and in at december   certificates of deposit comprised of total deposits  down from a year earlier 
the company increased its average balance of interest earning assets by million  or 
the company fueled this balance sheet expansion largely with an increase in borrowings  as overall deposit growth was limited by the company s objective of decreasing its cost of deposits relative to key capital market indices such as cofi and the year treasury yield 
the company was successful in this regard  as the weighted average cost of deposits declined from at december  to at december   while at the same time the cofi index rose from to and the year treasury yield rose from to 
average balances  average rates  and net interest margin the following table presents the average rate earned upon each major category of interest earning assets  the average rate paid for each major category of interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting net interest spread  net interest margin  and average interest margin on total assets for the years indicated

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average rate on interest earning assets and the average rate on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin equals net interest income before provision for estimated loan losses divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the company s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rate earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table utilizes the figures from the preceding table to present a comparison of interest income and interest expense resulting from changes in the volumes and the rates on average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated 
changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to volume changes are calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the prior year average interest rate 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to interest rate changes are calculated by multiplying the change in interest rate by the prior year average volume 
the changes in interest income or interest expense attributable to the combined impact of changes in volume and changes in interest rate are calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the change in volume 
year ended december  year ended december  compared to compared to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease due to increase decrease due to volume volume volume rate rate net volume rate rate net dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash equivalents investment securities   mortgage backed securities   loans receivable  net    fhlb stock total interest earning     assets interest bearing liabilities now accounts savings accounts money market accounts   certificates of deposit    total interest bearing     deposits fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing   liabilities increase decrease in net interest income      interest income for the year ended december   interest income was million  an increase of million  or  over the amount recorded for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in interest income during was growth in average outstanding balances of loans receivable  which in turn stemmed from the record level of loan production recorded during interest income on loans receivable  which accounted for of total interest income for the year ended december   grew by million in compared to interest income on mortgage backed securities during declined by million from the prior year due to reduced average volumes outstanding 
during  the company used scheduled payments  prepayments  and sales of mortgage backed securities as sources of cash to fund the expanding portfolio of loans receivable 
similarly  lower average volumes of investment securities during versus the prior year led to a million year to year decline in interest income on investment securities 
the weighted average yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the yield on interest earning assets was principally due to loans receivable increasing as a percentage of interest earning assets  from during to during yields on mortgage backed and investment securities increased slightly during  but represented a significantly smaller portion of total interest earning assets 
the increase in general market interest rates that occurred in also bolstered the company s yield on interest earning assets  particularly those portfolios such as construction loans and corporate trust preferred securities that reprice based upon relatively responsive indices such as prime and libor  respectively 
the weighted average nominal rate on the company s loan portfolio increased from at december  to at december  interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in interest expense was primarily attributable to a reduction in the company s average cost of deposits  which in turn stemmed from a combination of the aforementioned change in deposit mix and from the company s adopting a less aggressive pricing strategy  particularly for certificates of deposit  than had been employed in prior periods 
the company s average cost of interest bearing deposits declined to in  from in interest expense on fhlb advances rose from million in to million in  as the impact of greater average balances outstanding more than offset the effect of a decline in the average rate paid 
provision for loan losses implicit in lending activities is the risk that losses will occur and that the amount of such losses will vary over time 
consequently  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses by charging a provision to operations 
loans determined to be losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management  at a point in time and with then available information  to be adequate to provide for estimated losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management estimates the amount of potential loss for each individual loan that has been identified as having greater than standard credit risk  including loans identified as criticized special mention  classified substandard or lower graded  impaired per sfas no 
 troubled debt restructured  and non performing 
in determining specific and general loss estimates  management incorporates such factors as collateral value  portfolio composition and concentration  trends in local and national economic and real estate conditions  historical credit experience  and the financial status of borrowers 
while the allowance is segmented by broad portfolio categories to analyze its adequacy  the allowance is general in nature and is available for the loan portfolio in its entirety 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  future provisions are subject to continuing evaluation of inherent risk in the loan portfolio  as conducted by both management and the bank s regulators 
for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  during  the amount and timing of provisions for loan losses were primarily generated the following key factors o the increasing absolute size of the loan portfolio o the continuing change in mix within the loan portfolio  away from residential mortgages to other types of lending  particularly construction loans and mortgages secured by commercial and industrial real estate o a rise in criticized assets and classified assets from million and million  respectively  at december  to million and million  respectively  at december  o net charge offs of  recorded in  versus net recoveries of  in construction  commercial real estate  multifamily  and business lending generally involve a greater risk of loss than do mortgages on single family residences 
the company s allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   comprised of million in general reserves and  in specific reserves 
this compares to an allowance of million at december   all but  of which was in general reserves 
the allowance represented of loans receivable at december   compared to a year earlier 
to the extent that the company is successful in its business strategy and thereby continues building the size of its loan portfolio while also extending increased volumes of construction  income property  and business lending  management anticipates that additional provisions will be charged against operations in  with the ratio of allowance to loans receivable rising to reflect the greater credit exposure inherent in the loan mix 
the level of provision in will also likely be impacted by o the resolution of the million non accrual business term loan maintained by mbbc o the borrower performance and the guarantor financial status associated with a pool of residential mortgages acquired in that present a weaker credit profile than that typically pursued by the company see item business credit quality special residential loan pool and note to the consolidated financial statements non interest income non interest income increased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due o a rise in net gains on the sale of mortgage backed and investment securities from  in to  in o customer service charges increasing from  in to  in o commissions from the sale of non fdic insured products expanding from  in to  in the company sold mortgage backed and investment securities in as a means of funding expansion in the loan portfolio and in order to moderate the company s exposure to increases in general market interest rates 
the increase in customer service charges in was primarily due to a larger customer base and a higher number of transaction related customer deposit accounts 
the increase in commission income from sales of noninsured products reflects more effective cross selling of these products to the company s customer base 
further augmenting non interest income constitutes a primary component of the company s business strategy 
in  the company plans to enhance its results from the sale of non fdic insured investment products by reviewing third party contracts  considering the licensing of additional staff  broadening its product line  and hiring a new program manager 
also in  the company plans to augment customer service charges by reviewing the bank s fee and service charge schedule  introducing internet banking and electronic bill payment services  further increasing the number of transaction accounts  installing an additional off premises atm  and continuing to increase the proportion of its customer base using debit cards 
debit card income constituted a growing source of revenue for the company in no assurance can  however  be provided that the company will be successful in its plans to increase non interest income 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and factors contributing to the rise in included o the operation of the felton branch for all of  versus eight months in o the addition of staff to support the company s greater volumes of loan origination  loan servicing  and deposit account transactions o increased commission expense associated with greater sales of non fdic insured investment products o higher incentive payments associated with the company s sales and financial success in o greater postage and data and item processing costs driven by an increased volume of transaction deposit accounts o non recurring costs of  associated with a single operating loss stemming from the operation of non qualified benefit plans the company anticipates a further increase in general and administrative costs in due to o the planned continued growth in transaction deposit accounts o the cost of implementing internet banking  bill payment  and an additional off premises atm o the expiration of its existing contract for third party data processing services o the hiring of additional key staff positions  including a new chief financial officer o increased promotional costs associated with the introduction of new products and services combined with a special marketing program integrated with the company s th anniversary management plans to moderate the financial impact of the above increases in general and administrative expenses with greater revenues and higher productivity in the conduct of the company s operations 
however  no assurance can be provided that the company will be successful in this regard 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  compared to million during this rise was entirely associated with an increase in pre tax income in versus  as the company s effective tax rate declined modestly in versus the prior year 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million  or investment securities declined from million at december  to million at december  due to sales conducted in order to generate funding for the company s increasing loan portfolio 
the company s investment security portfolio at december  was entirely composed of variable rate trust preferred securities 
to the extent that the company is successful with its business strategy in  management anticipates selling the remainder of these securities in order to bolster the bank s qualified thrift lender ratio  shift funds into assets that function as more effective collateral under secured borrowing arrangements  and provide funds for further expansion in loans receivable 
mortgage backed securities declined from million at december  to million at december  this reduction stemmed from ongoing principal repayments and million in sales 
this decrease was accomplished in conjunction with management s strategy of reducing interest rate risk and increasing the overall yield of interest earning assets by selling longer duration and comparatively lower yielding mortgage backed securities and reinvesting into shorter duration and higher yielding loans receivable 
loans receivable held for investment  net of allowances for estimated loan losses  were million at december   compared to million at december  this increase stemmed from million in originations during  of which the largest category was construction loans with million in new credit commitments 
construction loans net of undisbursed loan funds rose from million at december  to million at december   thereby accounting for of the overall rise in net loans receivable accomplished during because construction loans are by nature short term generally twelve to eighteen months in term  the company has become increasingly exposed to fluctuations in the size of its loan portfolio 
more specifically  should higher general market interest rates or some other factor diminish the demand for new construction lending  the company s position in construction loans would thereby likely quickly diminish as existing projects are completed 
commercial and industrial real estate loans increased from million at december  to million at december  in conjunction with the company s business strategy 
at december   residential mortgages continued to be the largest single category of the company s net loans receivable held for investment  totaling million  or of the portfolio 
this percentage compares to one year earlier 
the company continued to amortize its intangible assets during  reducing their balance from million at december  to million one year later 
this amortization  which is a non cash charge to operations  bolsters the bank s regulatory capital ratios  as intangible assets are deducted from gaap capital in determining regulatory capital 
during the year ended december   the company s liabilities increased by million to million  from million at december  the increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in advances from the fhlb 
the increase in advances was used primarily to fund the growth in loans receivable 
none of the company s advances at december  were putable  thereby exposing the company to increased funding costs in a rising interest rate environment 
deposits decreased to million at december  from million at december   as the company focused upon changing its deposit mix and reducing its average cost of deposits in priority over building nominal deposit balances 
shareholders equity declined million from million at december  to million one year later 
the decrease in equity occurred despite record earnings by the company  as  during o the company repurchased  of its outstanding shares  which decreased shareholders equity by million o accumulated other comprehensive income declined by million due to reduced market values for the company s security portfolios  which in turn stemmed from the increasing interest rate environment and the relatively high duration of a significant portion of the mortgage backed securities portfolio o the company paid  in cash dividends o the company acquired  worth of its stock in conjunction with its non qualified stock compensation plans results of operations for the years ended december  and december  overview the company recorded net income of million  or basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   compared to million  or basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the company s return on average assets for was  compared to in the return on average equity for was  compared with in net income for the year ended december  reflected higher net interest income and non interest income compared to the year ended december   offset by a higher provision for estimated loan losses and increases in general and administrative expenses 
the operating results of the company for the year ended december  reflect the assumption of approximately million in deposits and the purchase of an equal amount of loans from commercial pacific bank  the opening of an eighth branch felton  and strong in market growth of low cost deposits 
net interest income before provision for estimated loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during the same periods  the average volume of interest earning assets was million and million  respectively 
the increase in net interest income reflects the growth in higher yielding loans and mortgage backed securities  funded primarily by growth in relatively low cost deposits 
the company has  for the last two years  focused its efforts on becoming more like a community based commercial bank by increasing its commercial real estate  construction  multifamily  and business lending activities 
additionally  the bank focused its deposit gathering efforts on low cost transaction accounts  consisting of checking  savings  and money market accounts  partly by pursuing small businesses in market  which complements the business lending function 
continued implementation of the company s strategic decision to transition from a traditional savings institution to a community banking orientation  and the expansion of the company s branch locations and product lines  resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses during expansion activity included the company s opening of a branch site in felton  california  which began operations as a full service bank branch in may  and the assumption of approximately million in deposits and the purchase of an approximately equal amount of loans in april from commercial pacific bank 
net interest income for the year ended december   the million  or  increase in net interest income versus the prior year was primarily due to the acquisition of approximately million in deposits during the second quarter of  which fueled an increase in the average outstanding balance of mortgage backed securities and loans receivable 
spreads improved somewhat in versus  as the company was then in the earlier stages of implementing its current business strategy 
net interest income to average total assets expanded from in to in interest income for the year ended december   interest income was million  an increase of million  or  over the amount recorded for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in interest income during was growth in average outstanding balances of mortgage backed securities and loans receivable  which in turn was fueled by the purchase of approximately million in loans from commercial pacific bank as well as in market growth of loans receivable 
interest income on loans receivable  which accounted for of total interest income for the year ended december   grew by million in compared to the growth in interest income on loans receivable during was due to a higher average balance of outstanding loans receivable and an increase in the average yield earned 
interest income on mortgage backed securities grew by million  for the year ended december  interest income from other investment securities and cash equivalents declined by million  for the year ended december   due to lower average volumes and rates on investment securities in compared to the weighted average yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  despite a declining interest rate environment  the average yield on interest earning assets declined only basis points in compared to the magnitude of the decline in the yield on interest earning assets was limited due to an increase in the average balance of the highest interest earning category loans receivable 
the average yield on loans receivable increased basis points  primarily due to the fact that of the loans originated for the portfolio during were higher yielding construction  commercial real estate  multifamily  and business loans 
yields on mortgage backed securities declined during due to higher prepayments and a corresponding increase in premium amortization 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a higher average balance of deposits resulting from the assumption of approximately million in deposits from commercial pacific bank and the opening of the felton branch office 
the company s average cost of interest bearing deposits declined to in  from in  primarily due to the effects of a more favorable mix of deposits and a lower interest rate environment 
the declining interest rate environment allowed management to lower  on average  interest rates paid to its customers on maturing and renewing term deposit accounts 
interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings declined by million due to a lower average outstanding balance of borrowings in provision for loan losses for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  during  the company increased its provision for loan losses in connection with implementing its strategy to increase the amount of construction  commercial real estate  multifamily  and business lending 
these types of loans generally involve a greater risk of loss than do one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the  provision  as well as the  of allowance for loan losses provided on loans acquired from commercial pacific bank  resulted in a total allowance for loan losses of  or of loans receivable  at december   compared to an allowance for loan losses of  or of loans receivable  at december  non performing loans were million  or of gross loans receivable  at december   compared to million  or of gross loans receivable  a year earlier 
non interest income non interest income increased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increases in customer service charges and commissions from sales of noninsured products during customer service charges consist primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and fees for certain customer services 
the increase in customer service charges in was primarily due to a larger customer base  a higher number of transaction related customer deposit accounts  and a full year of surcharging foreign atm cardholders 
the increase in commission income from sales of noninsured products reflects a more effective job of cross selling these products to the company s customer base 
during the years ended december  and  the company sold million and million  respectively  of securities held for sale  including mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and recorded net gains of  and  respectively  on the sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the increases in were partially attributable to higher compensation and employee benefits  as new employees were hired to support the company s deposit growth and the expansion of its branch locations and new product lines and services 
in addition  general and administrative expenses for included higher data processing costs  increased professional fees and advertising expenses  higher stationery  telephone  and office expenses 
the increases in certain categories of general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by lower amortization of core deposit premium and reduced deposit insurance premiums compared to amortization of core deposit premium was  lower in and deposit insurance premiums were  lower  compared to income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million for both the years ended december  and income tax expense remained the same in  compared to  despite a decline in income before income tax due to an increase in the effective tax rate in  compared to the previous year 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  liquidity liquidity is actively managed to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of both the company in general and the bank in particular 
liquidity management includes projections of future sources and uses of funds to ensure the availability of sufficient liquid reserves to provide for unanticipated circumstances 
the bank s primary sources of liquidity are deposits  principal and interest payments including prepayments on its asset portfolios  retained earnings  fhlb advances  other borrowings  and  to a lesser extent  sales of loans originated for sale and securities classified as available for sale 
the bank s primary uses of funds include loan originations  customer drawdowns on lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan commitments  loan purchases  customer withdrawals of deposits  interest paid on liabilities  and operating expenses 
in the year  the bank intends to pursue additional sources of liquidity  including the capacity to purchase federal funds and an expansion in the number of counterparties with whom the bank may conduct securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions 
the bank pledges excess collateral to the fhlb in order to have ready access to additional liquidity 
at december   the bank maintained untapped borrowing capacity of approximately million at the fhlb 
in addition  at december   the company owned a significant volume of unpledged loans and securities which could be used for either liquidation or secured borrowings in order to meet future liquidity requirements 
from time to time  depending upon its asset and liability strategy  the company converts a portion of its residential whole loans into mortgage backed securities 
these conversions provide increased liquidity because the mortgage backed securities are typically more readily marketable than the underlying loans and because they can more effectively be used as collateral for borrowings 
during  the company converted approximately million of its fixed rate residential loans into mortgage backed securities 
the company did not securitize any portion of its residential mortgages during during recent years  the company s surplus liquidity position has declined in conjunction with a rise in the company s ratio of loans to deposits 
this ratio increased from at december  to at december   as the company experienced record loan originations during during  the bank intends to pursue the acquisition of short term  unsecured lines of credit from correspondent financial institutions as another source of liquidity 
in addition  the bank also plans on altering the mix within its security portfolio in order to generate enhanced borrowing capacity 
no assurance  however  can be provided that the bank will be successful in these objectives 
mbbc  as a company separate from the bank  must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of mbbc s cash inflows are obtained from principal and interest payments on loans  interest on its security and cash equivalent positions  repayment of the funds advanced for the esop  and dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to mbbc 
as of december   mbbc did not have any commitments for capital expenditures or to fund loans 
as discussed under item business capital requirements and capital categories  the bank was informed by the ots during the first quarter of that it would be required to maintain its regulatory capital ratios at levels equal to or above those reported at december  this additional regulatory capital requirement may limit the bank s ability to pay dividends to mbbc until the requirement is terminated by the ots 
throughout  the bank maintained a regulatory liquidity ratio in excess of that required by the ots 
the bank s strategy generally is to maintain its liquidity ratio slightly above the required minimum in order to maximize its yield on alternative investments 
at december   the company maintained million in commitments to fund loans 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet these commitments  not all of which will necessarily be drawn upon 
capital resources the bank s position as a well capitalized financial institution under the pca regulatory framework is further enhanced by the financial resources present at the mbbc holding company level 
at december   the consolidated gaap capital position of the bank was million  while the consolidated gaap capital position of the company was million 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital position  including amounts by which the bank exceeds minimum and well capitalized thresholds for regulatory capital 
management believes the bank s regulatory capital position in will continue to benefit from three key factors o the continued amortization of intangible assets o the continued amortization of deferred stock compensation o the bank s earnings for the year the potential continued increase in the size of the loan portfolio  combined with the ongoing planned shift in mix toward construction and commercial and industrial real estate lending  may result in the bank s having higher levels of risk weighted assets during  thereby possibly offsetting some of the effect of the above three factors upon regulatory capital ratios incorporating risk weighted assets 
during the first quarter of  the bank received a letter from the ots mandating that the bank not permit its regulatory capital ratios to decline below the levels existing at december  see item business credit quality special residential loan pool and note to the consolidated financial statements 
management does not foresee any significant problem with this request given the favorable impact of the aforementioned three factors upon the bank s regulatory capital 
the company has conducted share repurchases since through december   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock  leaving  shares then outstanding 
during the first quarter of  the company purchased an additional  shares in the open market under its most recently announced share repurchase plan 
while these share repurchases contributed to a reduction in shareholders equity from million at december  to million at december   they provided a beneficial impact upon earnings per share 
the company paid dividends of per share in and per share in the board of directors periodically reviews the level of the company s dividends  and has historically declared such semi annually in order to constrain operating costs 
the ability of mbbc to fund additional share repurchases and to pay dividends in will depend  in part  upon the performance of the holding company s loan portfolio and the amount of dividends  if any  that might be received from the bank 
as previously discussed  due to additional regulatory capital requirement imposed upon the bank by the ots during the first quarter of  the bank s ability to pay dividends to mbbc may be limited until the additional requirement is terminated by the ots 
year issue the year issue concerned the potential impact of historic computer software code that only utilizes two digits to represent the calendar year eg for 
software so developed  and not corrected  could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results commencing on january   when current and future dates present a lower two digit year number than dates in the prior century 
the company experienced no material adverse consequences as a result of the year issue  either in early january  or on february  special leap year date 
none of the key vendors or suppliers to the company reported significant problems related to the year issue 
through early march   the company was not aware of any customers with significant borrowings or deposits that experienced material difficulties arising from the year issue 
the company maintained various contingency plans related to the year issue 
however  none of these plans was activated due to the lack of problems 
as of december   the company had incurred cumulatively approximately  in costs related to the year issue  of which  were recorded in these costs  which included software diagnostic tools and consulting services  were expensed as incurred 
these costs did not include the value of the time allocated by company employees to year issue related work 
these costs also did not include expenditures for capital investments made in the normal course of the company s business eg new personal computers that  by nature  provided benefits related to the year issue 
the company s year issue costs were moderated by the fact that the company outsources most of its data and item processing  and therefore did not have extensive internally developed or maintained software to address 
the company does not anticipate incurring additional expenses associated with the year issue in future periods 
certain technology projects  most prominent of which is an internet banking product  were deferred as a result of the company s year compliance efforts and concerns about potential resource requirements to deal with various contingencies related to possible third party or customer problems 
however  these deferrals did not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company anticipates introducing its internet banking product in  utilizing software developed and maintained by a third party firm 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires the measurement of most financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  the company s assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary in nature 
consequently  relative and absolute levels of interest rates present a greater impact on the company s performance and condition than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
the company s operating costs  however  are subject to the impact of inflation  particularly in the case of salaries and benefits costs  which typically constitute almost one half of the company s total general administrative expenses 
during  relatively low unemployment rates contributed to increased salary and benefits costs  especially as the company sought to continue expanding its loan production while also attracting experienced financial services industry employees to facilitate and accelerate its strategic transformation into a community based financial services firm 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other securities or contracts  and hedging activities 
as originally issued  sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in july   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
in general  sfas no 
delays for one year the effective date of sfas no 
the company anticipates adopting sfas no 
effective january  because the company did not maintain any derivatives at december   the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to be material 
on january  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement conforms the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans with the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of other types of assets 
the primary impact upon the company is to permit securities resulting from the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale to be classified based upon the ability and intent of the company  in a manner consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk 
the results of operations for financial institutions such as the company may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including rapid changes in interest rates  declines in real estate market values  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
interest rate risk irr and credit risk typically constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for banks and thrifts 
for a discussion of the company s credit risk  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses 
the company utilizes no derivatives to mitigate either its credit risk or its irr  instead relying on loan review and adequate loan loss reserves in the case of credit risk and portfolio management techniques in the case of irr 
the company is not significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or other market risks other than interest rate risk 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of general market interest rates might have upon the company s net interest income  results of operations  and theoretical liquidation value  also called net portfolio value npv 
interest rate changes impact earnings and npv in many ways  including effects upon the yields generated by variable rate assets  the cost of deposits and other sources of funds  the exercise of options embedded in various financial instruments  and customer demand for and market supply of different financial assets  liabilities  and positions 
in order to manage irr  the company has established an asset liability management committee alco  which includes representatives from senior management and the board of directors 
alco is responsible for managing the company s financial assets and liabilities in a manner which balances profitability  irr  and various other risks eg liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by and regularly reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s irr management program is to maximize net interest income while controlling irr exposure to within prudent levels 
financial institutions are subject to irr whenever assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times repricing  or gap  risk  based upon different capital markets indices basis risk  for different terms yield curve risk  or are subject to various embedded options  such as the right of mortgage borrowers to refinance their loans when general market interest rates decline 
companies with high concentrations of real estate lending  such as the company  are significantly impacted by prepayment rates on loans  as such prepayments generally return investable funds to the company at a time of relatively lower prevailing general market interest rates 
decisions to control or accept irr are analyzed with consideration of the probable occurrence of future interest rate changes 
stated another way  irr management encompasses the evaluation of the likely additional return associated with an incremental change in the irr profile of the company 
for example  having liabilities that mature or reprice faster than assets can be beneficial when interest rates decline  but may be detrimental when interest rates rise 
assessment of potential changes in market interest rates and the relative financial impact to earnings and npv is used by the company to help quantify and manage irr 
as with credit risk  the complete elimination of irr would curtail the company s profitability  as the company generates a return  in part  through effective risk management 
the company monitors its interest rate risk using various analytical methods that include participation in the ots net portfolio value interest rate risk modeling  third party simulation modeling of the company s balance sheet  and other analyses and management reports 
the company s exposure to irr as of december  was within the limits established by the board of directors 
a common  if analytically limited  measure of financial institution irr is the institution s static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted by off balance sheet positions  if any which are expected to mature or reprice within a specified period 
a static gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities in a given time period or cumulatively through that time period 
the converse is true for a negative static gap 
the following table presents the maturity and rate sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the repricing gap figures in the table reflect the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are contractually scheduled to mature or reprice whichever occurs first during future periods 
at december  more than more than more than non months months year years over interest or less to year to years to years years bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest earning cash equivalents   investment securities   mortgage backed securities   loans receivable  net of lip       fhlb stock   gross interest earning assets       less unamortized yield adjustments allowance for loan losses   interest earning assets        non interest earning assets   total assets        liabilities and equity now accounts   savings accounts   money market accounts   certificates of deposit      total interest bearing deposits      fhlb advances     other borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities       non interest bearing liabilities   shareholders equity   total liabilities and equity        periodic repricing gap      cumulative repricing gap      periodic repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative repricing gap as a of interest earning assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a of cumulative interest bearing liabilities as presented in the prior table  at december   the company s cumulative one year and three year static gaps  based upon contractual repricing and maturities ie ignoring prepayments and other non contractual factors were and  respectively  of total interest earning assets 
these figures suggest that net interest income would increase if general market interest rates were to decline and vice versa  reflecting a net liability sensitive position 
however  static gap analysis such as that presented above fails to capture material components of irr  and therefore provides only a limited  point in time view of the company s irr exposure 
the assumptions and factors which are by definition excluded from static gap analysis prepared on a contractual basis encompass o prepayments on assets o how rate movements and the shape of the treasury curve  or the libor swap curve  affect borrower behavior o that all loans and deposits repricing at a given time will not adjust to the same degree or by the same magnitude o that the nature of rate changes for assets and liabilities in the over one year category have a greater long term economic impact than those for shorter term assets and liabilities o transaction deposit accounts significant to the company do not have scheduled repricing dates or contractual maturities  and therefore may respond to interest rate changes differently than other financial instruments o potential company strategic and operating responses to changes in absolute and relative interest rate levels o the financial impact of options embedded in various financial instruments another measure of irr  required to be performed by insured depository institutions regulated by the ots  is a procedure specified by thrift bulletin a  interest rate risk management 
this test measures the impact upon npv of an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in basis point increments 
the following table presents the estimated impacts of such changes in interest rates upon the company as of december   calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin a 
however  the results from any cash flow simulation model are dependent upon a lengthy series of assumptions about current and future economic  behavioral  and financial conditions  including many factors over which the company has no control 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  prepayment rates on various asset portfolios and decay rates on core deposits  including savings  checking  and money market accounts 
because of the uncertainty regarding the accuracy of assumptions utilized and because such an analytical technique does not contemplate any actions the company might undertake in response to changes in interest rates  no assurance can be provided that the valuations presented in the following table are representative of what might actually be obtainable 
in addition  the following figures are by definition not indicative of the company s economic value as a going concern or of the company s market value 
projected change in change in interest rates in basis points npv dollars percent dollars in thousands base scenario  the above table results show that the company s liquidation value is significantly more sensitive under rising interest rates versus falling interest rates 
under rising interest rates  the company s assets experience a lengthening of duration relative to the liability side  resulting in a reduction of npv 
this occurs due to the slower prepayment behavior under rising rates the analysis assumed on mortgage related assets  in conjunction with embedded options such as periodic and lifetime rate adjustment caps on adjustable rate loans  all of which work to constrain aggregate asset repricing relative to liabilities and reduce npv 
such results are directionally consistent with the static gap analysis presented above 
under falling interest rates  the table results show npv to have limited sensitivity  indicating a relatively well matched balance sheet under falling rate scenarios 
this occurs mainly due to the faster prepayment behavior under falling rates the analysis assumes on mortgage related assets  which works to accelerate asset repricing shorten asset duration to levels matched by liabilities  causing npv sensitivity to remain relatively stable under falling interest rate scenarios 
a technical term for balance sheets which exhibit this irr profile is negatively convex  a description typical of balance sheets containing a significant percentage of assets related to residential mortgages in whole loan or security form 
negatively convex means that that the balance sheet may suffer comparatively large reductions in npv when interest rates rise  offset with relatively small increases in npv when interest rates fall 
in capital markets  the asymmetric nature of this relationship is typically compensated for with higher rates of return in the current or base case scenario 
a significant portion of the company s total irr exposure at december  was concentrated in two asset portfolios mortgage backed securities and long term  fixed rate residential mortgages held for investment 
over the past year  the company s irr exposure has been reduced through a combination of several strategies  including o increasing core deposits  particularly checking accounts  as a means of increasing the weighted average duration of the company s funding o originating and retaining variable rate loans  including those tied to relatively responsive capital markets indices such as the year cmt and the wall street journal prime rate o selling fixed rate mortgage backed securities from the available for sale portfolio to fund loan growth o selling the new production of fixed rate  residential mortgages into the secondary market o continuing to diversify the loan portfolio away from its historic concentration in residential mortgages towards increased construction and commercial real estate lending  which typically generates more interest sensitive  and higher yielding  assets despite the company s irr management program and the initiatives detailed above  due to the multiple factors which influence the company s exposure to irr  many of which are beyond the control of the company  there can be no assurance that the company s earnings or economic value will be maintained in future periods  nor that the company will be successful in continuing to reduce its irr exposure
