item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview sonic is the second largest automotive retailer in the united states  as measured by total revenue  operating dealership franchises and collision repair centers in the southeastern  southwestern  mid western  mid atlantic and western united states 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sell replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services and arrange related f i for its automotive customers 
new vehicle revenues include both the sale and lease of new vehicles 
used vehicle revenues include amounts received for used vehicles sold to retail customers  other dealers and wholesalers 
other operating revenues include parts and services revenues  fees and commissions for arranging f i and sales of third party extended warranties for vehicles 
in connection with vehicle financing contracts  sonic receives a finance fee from the lender for originating the loan 
if  within days of origination  the customer pays off the loans through refinancing or selling trading in the vehicle or defaults on the loan  the finance company will assess a charge a chargeback for a portion of the original commission 
the amount of the chargeback depends on how long the related loan was outstanding 
as a result  sonic has established reserves based on its historical chargeback experience 
sonic also sells warranties provided by third party vendors  and recognizes a commission at the time of sale 
the automobile industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns  characterized by oversupply and weak demand 
many factors affect the industry including general economic conditions and consumer confidence  the level of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit 
while the automotive retailing business is cyclical  we sell several products and services that are not closely tied to the sale of new and used vehicles 
such products and services include our parts and service and collision repair businesses  both of which are not dependent upon near term new vehicle sales volume 
our cost of sales and profitability are also affected by the allocations of new vehicles which our dealerships receive from manufacturers 
when we do not receive allocations of new vehicle models adequate to meet customer demand  we may purchase additional vehicles from other dealers at a premium to the manufacturer s invoice  reducing the gross margin realized on the sales of such vehicles 
in addition  we follow a disciplined approach in selling vehicles to other dealers and wholesalers when the vehicles have been in our inventory longer than the guidelines set by us 
such sales are frequently at or below cost and  therefore  reduce our overall gross margin on vehicle sales 
sonic s salary expense  employee benefits costs and advertising expenses comprise the majority of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
approximately of our operating costs for the year ended december  were variable 
we are able to adjust these expenses as the operating or economic environment impacting our dealerships changes 
we manage these variable costs  such as advertising of operating costs and sales compensation expenses  so that they are generally related to vehicle sales and can be adjusted in response to changes in vehicle sales volume 
in addition  management compensation is tied to individual dealership profitability and stock price appreciation through stock options 
sonic s interest expense fluctuates based primarily on the level of the inventory of new vehicles held at our dealerships  substantially all of which is financed through floor plan financing  as well as the amount of indebtedness incurred for acquisitions 
our floor plan expenses are offset by amounts received from manufacturers  in the form of floor plan inventory incentives 
these payments are credited against our cost of sales 
in  the amounts we received in manufacturer inventory incentives exceeded our floor plan expenses by approximately million 
this results in the effective borrowing rate under our floor plan facilities being reduced to after the incentives are taken into account 
sonic s business is fundamentally managed based on individual dealership operating performance 
each of sonic s dealerships have similar economic and operating characteristics 
each dealership sells similar products and services new and used vehicles  parts  service and collision repair services  uses similar processes in selling its products and services  and sells its products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result  sonic s dealerships are aggregated into a single operating segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
we have accounted for all of our dealership acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  we do not include in our financial statements the results of operations of these dealerships prior to the date they were acquired by us 
the consolidated financial statements of sonic discussed below reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of each of our dealerships acquired prior to december  as a result of the effects of our acquisitions  the historical consolidated financial information described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of sonic in the future or the results of operations  financial position and cash flows which would have resulted had such acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes  for the periods presented  the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in sonic s consolidated statements of income 
percentage of total revenues for year ended december  revenues new vehicle sales used vehicle sales parts  service  and collision repair finance and insurance total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative operating income interest expense income before income taxes twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues 
revenues grew in each of our primary revenue areas for as compared with  causing total revenues to increase to billion 
new vehicle sales revenue increased to billion in  compared with million in the increase was due primarily to a increase in new vehicle unit sales to  in from  in of this increase  approximately  or  units  resulted from acquisitions and resulted from stores owned longer than one year

such expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in compensation programs  which represent over of a dealership s selling  general and administrative expenses  are primarily based on gross profits 
as a result  the improvement in gross profit margins resulted in an increase in compensation expense as a percentage of total revenues to in from in in addition  rent expense increased as a percentage of total revenues to in from in primarily due to acquisitions of dealerships located in higher rent markets 
as a percentage of gross profits  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from  resulting primarily from benefits of scale which has allowed us to recognize cost savings  especially in the areas of advertising costs and insurance premiums

as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense was at in both and goodwill amortization expense increased to million in from million in  resulting principally from additional acquisitions 
interest expense  floor plan 
interest expense  floor plan increased to million in from million in  due primarily to floor plan interest expense incurred by dealerships acquired 
as a percentage of total revenues  floor plan interest decreased to in from in resulting from a decrease in the average interest rate under our floor plan financing arrangements as well as improvement in inventory turnover rates 
interest expense  other 
interest expense  other increased to million in from million in due primarily to interest incurred on our senior subordinated notes issued on july  and on additional borrowings under our revolving facility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to an effective rate of in the increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions we made during the year which were either companies operating in states with higher income tax rates  or stock purchases in which the goodwill amortization is not deductible for income tax purposes 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase in as the acquisitions will be part of our results for the full period 
net income 
as a result of the factors noted above  our net income increased by million in compared to twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues 
revenues grew in each of sonic s primary revenue areas for as compared with  causing total revenues to increase to billion 
this increase was due primarily to revenues contributed by our acquisitions completed in and of approximately million 
new vehicle sales revenue increased to million in  compared with million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in new vehicle unit sales of to  as compared with  in resulting principally from  units contributed by the acquisitions completed during and the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the average selling price of new vehicles resulting principally from sales of higher priced import vehicles contributed by sonic s acquisitions 
used vehicle revenues from retail sales increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to an increase in used vehicle unit sales of to  as compared with  in  resulting from additional unit sales contributed by acquisitions completed in and the remainder of the increase was due to a increase in the average selling price of used vehicles  resulting principally from sales of higher priced luxury and import vehicles contributed by our acquisitions  along with an increase in used vehicle revenues from stores owned for longer than one year of in over sonic s parts  service and collision repair revenue increased to million in compared to million in  due principally to our acquisitions

gross profit increased to million in from million in due principally to increases in revenues contributed by our acquisitions 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to from due to increases in new vehicle gross margins from to resulting from sales of higher margin import vehicles contributed by our acquisitions  as well as improved gross margins of used vehicles from to resulting from efforts made to improve management of used vehicle inventories 
in addition  because gross margins from used vehicle revenues are higher than gross margins from new vehicle revenues  an increase in used vehicle revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  and a decrease in new vehicle revenues as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  also contributed to the overall increase in gross profits as a percentage of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to from due principally to expenses inherent with the initial growth and formation of sonic 
in addition  because sales compensation  which comprises over of total selling  general and administrative expenses  is based on gross profits as opposed to revenues  the increase in gross profit margins resulted in an increase in total selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense  excluding goodwill amortization  increased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense was at in both and goodwill amortization expense increased to million in from million in  resulting principally from additional acquisitions 
interest expense  floor plan 
interest expense  floor plan increased to million from million  due primarily to floor plan interest incurred by our acquisitions 
as a percentage of total revenues  floor plan interest decreased from to due to decreased interest rates under sonic s floor plan financing arrangements  as well as improvement in turnover rates 
interest expense  other 
interest expense  other increased to million from million  due primarily to interest incurred on sonic s senior subordinated notes and on acquisition related indebtedness 
net income 
as a result of the factors noted above  sonic s net income increased by million in compared to liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our various credit facilities  and borrowings and capital contributions from our stockholders to finance our operations and expansion 
on may   we completed a public offering of class a common stock which provided approximately million of additional capital resources for the consummation of acquisitions and repayment of borrowings under our million acquisition line of credit with ford motor credit company the revolving facility 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the increase was attributable principally to increases in net income offset by increases in accounts receivable 
cash used for investing activities in was approximately million  including million paid for acquisitions  net of cash received  and million in capital expenditures 
cash used for investing activities in was offset by proceeds received from the sale of real estate at town and country toyota and fort mill ford of approximately million 
cash used for investing activities in was approximately million  including million paid for acquisitions  net of cash received  and million in capital expenditures 
our principal capital expenditures typically include building improvements and equipment for use in our dealerships 
of the capital expenditures in  approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers 
of this amount  approximately million was subsequently sold to mmr holdings  llc  a limited liability company owned by bruton smith and sonic financial corporation sfc and leased back 
there was no gain or loss on the sale 
as noted below  mmr holdings was subsequently acquired by car mmr llc  an affiliate of capital automotive reit which is not affiliated with sonic 
other dealerships and collision repair centers still under construction as of december  are expected to be either financed separately by sonic or sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions upon completion 
on august   car mmr llc acquired all of the ownership interests of mmr holdings  llc  and two of its affiliates  mmr viking investment associates  lp and mmr tennessee  lpc collectively  the mmr group 
as of that date  sonic leased properties for of its dealerships from the mmr group under triple net leases which required sonic to pay all costs of operating the properties  as well as all taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs  maintenance and other property related expenses 
sonic has entered into new leases with car mmr llc with terms similar to those under sonic s former leases with the mmr group 
these leases generally provide sonic with options to renew the lease for two additional five year terms after the expiration of the initial lease term 
sonic has agreed to renew approximately of its lease rental stream for an additional five year period after the expiration of the initial lease terms 
in connection with the acquisition  sonic  mmr holdings and mar mar realty trust  an affiliate of the mmr group  terminated the strategic alliance agreement whereby mar mar realty trust had provided sonic with real estate sale leaseback financing  acquisition referral and related services 
as a part of the august  sale of the mmr group to car mmr  bruton smith and sfc signed agreements with sonic to induce sonic to enter into a real estate financing arrangement with car mmr and  among other things  amend its leases with the mmr group to standardize their terms 
under these agreements  mr 
smith and sfc agreed to pay approximately million to sonic  which amount represented mr 
smith s and sfc s profits on the sale of the mmr group less their selling expenses and a annual return on their initial investment in the mmr group  net of any advances made by sonic to the mmr group 
during  we acquired dealerships for approximately million in cash   shares of sonic s class a convertible preferred stock  series ii  recorded at an estimated value of approximately million   shares of sonic s class a convertible preferred stock  series iii  recorded at an estimated value of approximately million  and  shares of sonic s class a common stock having an estimated fair value at the time of issuance of approximately million 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with a combination of a portion of the proceeds from our public offering of class a common stock in may  cash borrowed under our revolving facility and cash generated from our existing operations 
the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of such acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates 
subsequent to december   we acquired dealerships for approximately million in cash and  shares of sonic s class a convertible preferred stock  series ii  having a liquidation value of  per share 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed with a combination of cash borrowed under the revolving facility and cash generated from sonic s existing operations 
the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in primarily reflects additional borrowings under the revolving facility used for acquisitions  as well as net proceeds received from our public offering of common stock completed on may  on november   the total borrowing limit under the revolving facility was increased from million to million 
prior to that date  amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bore interest at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to above the month commercial finance paper rate as reported by the federal reserve board the month commercial finance paper rate was at october  
subsequent to november   amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bear interest at above libor libor was at december  
the revolving facility will mature in october  but may be extended for a number of additional one year terms to be negotiated by us and ford motor credit company ford motor credit 
on may   in connection with the public offering by sonic of  shares of class a common stock  all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility were repaid 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility as of december  total approximately million and were used to finance acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of future amounts to be drawn under the revolving facility are to be used for the acquisition of additional dealerships and to provide general working capital needs not to exceed million 
we agreed under the revolving facility not to pledge any of our assets to any third party with the exception of currently encumbered assets of our dealership subsidiaries that are subject to previous pledges or liens 
in addition  the revolving facility contains certain negative covenants  including covenants restricting or prohibiting the payment of dividends  capital expenditures and material dispositions of assets as well as other customary covenants 
additional negative covenants include specified ratios of o current assets to current liabilities at least  o earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and rent less capital expenditures to fixed charges at least  o ebitda to interest expense at least and o total adjusted debt to ebitda no greater than 
in addition  the loss of voting control over sonic by bruton smith  scott smith and their spouses or immediate family members or the failure by sonic  with certain exceptions  to own all the outstanding equity  membership or partnership interests in its dealership subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the revolving facility 
sonic is in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  we currently have an aggregate principal balance of million in senior subordinated notes which mature on august  and bear interest at a stated rate of 
the notes are unsecured and are redeemable at our option after august  interest payments are due semi annually on august and february and commenced february  the notes are subordinated to all of our present and future senior indebtedness  including the revolving facility 
redemption prices during month periods beginning august are in  in  in and thereafter 
the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contains certain specified restrictive and required financial covenants 
we have agreed not to pledge our assets to any third party except under certain limited circumstances for example  floor plan indebtedness 
we have also agreed to certain other limitations or prohibitions concerning the incurrence of other indebtedness  capital stock  guaranties  asset sales  investments  cash dividends to shareholders  distributions and redemptions 
sonic is in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  we currently have standardized floor plan credit facilities with chrysler financial corporation chrysler financial and ford motor credit 
the floor plan credit facility with chrysler financial  which was obtained on november   provides up to million for the purchase of vehicles at our chrysler dealerships 
the floor plan facility with ford motor credit provides up to million for the purchase of vehicles at all of our other dealerships 
as of december   there was an aggregate of approximately million outstanding under the chrysler financial floorplan facility and million outstanding under the ford motor credit floor plan facility 
amounts outstanding under the chrysler financial floor plan facility bear interest at above libor libor was at december  
amounts outstanding under the ford motor credit floor plan facility bear interest at an effective interest rate of prime less prime was at december   subject to certain incentives and other adjustments 
typically new vehicle floor plan indebtedness exceeds the related inventory balances 
the inventory balances are generally reduced by the manufacturer s purchase discounts  which are not reflected in the related floor plan liability 
these manufacturer purchase discounts are standard in the industry  typically occur on all new vehicle purchases  and are not used to offset the related floor plan liability 
these discounts are aggregated and generally paid to us by the manufacturers on a quarterly basis 
we make monthly interest payments on the amount financed under the floor plan facilities but are not required to make loan principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
the underlying notes are due when the related vehicles are sold and are collateralized by vehicle inventories and other assets of the relevant dealership subsidiary 
the floor plan facility contains a number of covenants  including among others  covenants restricting us with respect to the creation of liens and changes in ownership  officers and key management personnel 
sonic is in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  during  sonic s board of directors authorized sonic to expend up to million to repurchase shares of its class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
as of december   sonic has repurchased  shares of class a common stock for approximately million 
through march   sonic has repurchased  additional shares of class a common stock for approximately million and has redeemed  shares of class a convertible preferred stock for approximately million 
sonic will continue to repurchase shares in the open market from time to time subject to market conditions 
subsequent to december   sonic has sold  signed definitive agreements to sell  or signed letters of intent to sell three dealerships for approximately million in proceeds 
no material gains or losses are expected from these sales 
we believe that funds generated through future operations and availability of borrowings under our floor plan financing or any replacements thereof and other credit arrangements will be sufficient to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
we expect to fund any future acquisitions from future cash flow from operations  additional debt financing including the revolving facility or the issuance of class a common stock  preferred stock or other convertible instruments 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first quarter generally contributes less revenue and operating profits than the second  third and fourth quarters 
seasonality is principally caused by weather conditions and the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers 
year issues we have not experienced any significant disruptions in operations as a result of year related problems  nor have we received indication from our primary banks  lenders or suppliers that they have experienced any significant disruptions as a result of year related problems 
although we do not anticipate any significant disruptions as a result of year problems  because of the uncertainties inherent with the year computer issue  we cannot make assurances that year problems will not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the costs associated with converting our internal systems to year compliant systems have not been material to our financial position or results of operations 
costs associated with upgrading and converting dealer management systems and dealer communication systems were covered by monthly maintenance contracts with the respective suppliers 
costs associated with upgrading or replacing personal computers and embedded systems were expensed or capitalized in accordance with our capitalization policy 
any additional costs which may be necessary for year conversions are not expected to be material 
significant materiality of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets acquired 
the cumulative gross goodwill balance at december  was million and at december  was million 
as a percentage of total assets and stockholders equity  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  represented and  respectively  at december   and and  respectively  at december  generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill and all other intangible assets be amortized over the period benefited 
we have determined that the period benefited by the goodwill will be no less than years 
accordingly  we are amortizing goodwill over a year period 
earnings reported in periods immediately following an acquisition would be overstated if we attributed a year benefit to an intangible asset that should have had a shorter benefit period 
in later years  we would be burdened by a continuing charge against earnings without the associated benefit to income valued by management in arriving at the consideration paid for the businesses acquired 
earnings in later years also could be significantly affected if management then determined that the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired 
we periodically compare the carrying value of goodwill with the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the business we have acquired in order to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill 
we have concluded that the anticipated future cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in our acquisitions will continue indefinitely  and there is no pervasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate over a period shorter than years 
we will incur additional goodwill in future acquisitions 
the financial accounting standards board recently proposed new rules relating to the accounting for business combinations and intangible assets 
one aspect of the proposal would not permit goodwill to be amortized over a period in excess of years  however  we cannot assure you that such a rule will be adopted and  if adopted  as to the final provisions of any such rules 
if such a rule is adopted  we have been advised that it would likely only affect the period over which we amortize goodwill in our future acquisitions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
sonic s only financial instruments with market risk exposure are variable rate floor plan notes payable  revolving facility borrowings and other variable rate notes 
the total outstanding balance of such instruments was approximately million at december  and million at december  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  of the total change in interest expense  approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  would have resulted from floor plan notes payable 
sonic s exposure with respect to floor plan notes payable is mitigated by floor plan incentives received from manufacturers which are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under sonic s floor plan financing arrangements 
in  the amounts we received from these manufacturer floor plan incentives exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million 
as a result  the effective rate incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements was reduced to after considering these incentives
