item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company was founded as retix in  and was originally concentrated in the internetworking market 
in  our operating divisions were split into three business units  each with its own management structure 
these three units focused on internetworking  network management software and wireless applications software 
in  we merged the wireless applications software subsidiary into our network management software subsidiary 
additionally  in  our internetworking hardware subsidiary  sonoma systems  inc  restructured to focus solely on broadband access equipment for the telecommunications marketplace 
in january  we discontinued investing in sonoma systems and our voting ownership was subsequently reduced from a wholly owned subsidiary to a interest  as sonoma systems raised additional capital from outside investors 
in december  we sold our holdings of series b and series c preferred stock in sonoma systems to a party related to newbridge networks corporation  a significant sonoma systems customer 
we retained an investment in sonoma systems primarily consisting of million of series a preferred stock that is non convertible and non voting 
our results of operations for and prior years have been recasted to present the operating results of sonoma systems as a discontinued operation 
we are now focused on network management software for the telecommunications industry 
further references to the company in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer solely to our continuing operations unless specifically identified otherwise 
vertel corporation vertel i was organized as a wholly owned subsidiary of retix in february in conjunction with the formation  retix transferred to vertel i the net assets of retix s tmn product line  including the direct and indirect subsidiaries through which retix historically conducted such business 
vertel i released its first tmn software products and services in vertel i merged into vertel corporation in in march  we acquired expersoft corporation expersoft  a developer and marketer of standards based  high performance common object request broker architecture corba software technology 
the acquisition price was approximately  and consisted of cash of  and acquisition costs of  at december   we had paid  of the cash consideration and acquisition costs 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
expersoft corporation was merged into vertel corporation in december we develop  market  and support vertically integrated  object oriented software solutions for the management of public telecommunications networks 
our solutions cover the telecommunications management network tmn market and the emerging corba market 
our tmn products  are based upon the international telecommunications union s tmn standard and support seamless network operation and management over diverse transmission media and protocols 
we believe that we offer the only commercially available  fully interoperable suite of products and tools that span the network element  element management  network management and service management layers of the tmn model 
we offer embedded software for network equipment and software solutions to allow telecommunications service providers to integrate proprietary  snmp  tmn  and corba based network management systems with standards based solutions 
in addition  we offer object oriented software platforms that facilitate the rapid development of network and service management applications and features such as fault detection and automatic response  remote improvement of network configuration  automation of accounting and billing functions and optimization of network traffic and security 
we also provide professional services to customers such as turnkey management solutions in addition to product integration and product application services 
our professional services include system analysis and design  source code portation and interface  custom application development  conformance and certification testing and technical support services 
we sell products and services primarily through a direct sales force in the united states and abroad and  in certain territories  through third party agents 
our customers include telecommunications service providers and their customers  network equipment manufacturers  independent software developers and software platform vendors 
we derive revenue primarily from software source license fees  royalties and services  including professional services  technical support and maintenance 
source license fees consist primarily of licenses of our software solutions and development platforms 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivables is probable and no significant production  modification or customization of software is required 
for contracts with multiple elements eg  software products  maintenance services and other services  we allocate revenue to each element of the contract based on objective evidence of the element s fair value 
this objective evidence of fair value is specific to us and consists either of prices derived from sales of elements when they are sold separately or the price established by our management for sale of elements in the ordinary course of business 
to date  substantially all source license fees have been recognized upon delivery to our customer 
source license agreements generally do not provide for a right of return 
we maintain reserves for returns and potential credit losses  neither of which has had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition through december  pursuant to source code license agreements  licensees may distribute binary or embedded versions of our software in our licensees products 
royalties become due upon shipment of products containing the binary or embedded code 
generally  software license royalty revenue is recognized upon notification by our licensee that products incorporating our software have been shipped by our licensee or  for customers for which we have sufficient historical information  upon estimated amounts which we expect the customer to report 
because of the development times required for licensees to design and ship products containing binary or embedded software  we generally do not receive royalties from shipments of such products for at least three quarters from the date we initially ship source code 
we separately offer professional services  including system design and engineering  custom application development  source code portation  conformance testing and certification and application development 
many of our customers contract for professional services 
these services are typically based on a detailed statement of work 
professional services revenue varies according to the size  timing and complexity of the project and is typically billed based on satisfaction of certain milestones or on a per day fee 
revenue from professional services is recognized using the percentage of completion method  or on a time and materials basis 
in certain cases  customers reimburse us for non recurring engineering efforts 
such reimbursements are recognized as revenue and associated costs are reflected as cost of revenues 
our technical support services consist of product support and maintenance  training and on site consulting 
product support and maintenance fees have constituted the majority of technical support revenue 
product support and maintenance fees typically have ranged from of the initial source license fee and are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract  which is generally six to twelve months 
other revenue from training and on site consulting is recognized as performed 
our operating expenses have increased substantially since as we have made investments related to the development and introduction of our tmn and corba products  expanded our sales force and established additional general and administrative functions 
additionally  we now incur goodwill amortization arising from our acquisition of expersoft in march in october  we announced a restructuring of our operations intended to reduce costs and make us more competitive 
as a result of the restructuring  we incurred a charge of  net of a restructuring benefit of  that arose from the reversal of excess restructuring reserves from prior years 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our workforce by approximately  moved some key functions to foreign subsidiaries and consolidated our us engineering functions to our san diego facility 
accordingly  we expect that our expenses going forward in will be lower than those incurred in while we are largely dependent on products complying with the tmn standard and must be evaluated in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies dependent upon such standards and products  we are expanding our products and technologies to reduce our dependence on tmn 
in addition  our markets are new and rapidly evolving which heightens these risks and uncertainties 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  successfully implement our marketing strategy  respond to competitive developments  continue to develop and upgrade our products and technologies more rapidly than our competitors and commercialize our products and services incorporating these enhanced technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in addressing any or all of these risks 
see item business  risk factors our success is dependent on widespread  timely adoption of the corba and tmn standards 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of operations as a percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development 
sales and marketing general and administrative goodwill amortization restructuring expense total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations net revenues 
net revenues increased to  in from  in following a decrease from  in the increase in net revenues in compared to was due primarily to higher revenues from professional service contracts and increased maintenance revenues  which were partially offset by a decrease in license revenues 
the slight decrease in net revenues in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues from professional service contracts and custom software engineering services  which were partially offset by an increase in license revenues 
license revenues consist primarily of license fees and royalties derived from our software solutions and development platforms  and historically have accounted for a substantial portion of total revenue in each quarter 
annual license revenues decreased to  during from  in following a increase from  in the decrease in license revenues in as compared to was due primarily to a  licensing fee arising out of a semi exclusive licensing contract with a customer for our aeronautical telecommunications network atn router software during the second quarter of  approximately  of license revenue attributable to certain background technology recognized in connection with our sale of our cdpd and pact technologies during the third quarter of  revenues during the first and second quarters of related to our atn and cdpd product lines which were sold in approximately  and a one time licensing to a related party in the first quarter of 
these decreases were partially offset by  in expersoft licensing revenues recognized in the increase in license revenues in as compared to was primarily due to the  semi exclusive atn licensing contract  approximately  license revenue associated with the sale of our cdpd and pact technologies and the related party license of  as noted above 
these increases were partially offset by the one time final billing of  related to the discontinuance of the pact based two way paging messaging products in service and other revenues consist primarily of professional services  maintenance  technical support  non recurring engineering projects  training and other revenues 
service and other revenues increased to  during from  in following a decrease from  in the increase in service and other revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of additional professional service contracts  and additional maintenance revenues stemming from the acquisition of expersoft  which were partially offset by lower custom engineering service revenues  and lower maintenance revenues  as a result of the aforementioned sale of our atn and cdpd product lines 
the decrease in service and other revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of fewer professional service contracts and lower custom software engineering services 
our sales to customers outside of the united states comprised approximately  and  respectively  of net revenues in  and we have historically reported a high percentage of sales to customers outside of the united states and we expect that trend to continue 
gross margin 
cost of revenues consists primarily of professional engineering services and warranty and technical support  primarily comprised of payroll and related costs  and royalties paid under third party software licensing agreements 
gross margin decreased to of net revenues in  from in and in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to a higher percentage of service and other revenues in the product mix  which have a lower margin compared to license revenues 
additionally  the lower margin in was the result of a license transaction of expersoft during the first quarter of valued at  of which  in costs and estimated earnings had accrued to expersoft prior to the acquisition as a result of expersoft completing substantially all of the related software development 
the slight increase in gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to the decrease in professional service revenues  which typically have lower margins than license revenues 
we anticipate that changes to pricing structures and distribution strategies may occur  and that margins may fluctuate and could decline in future periods 
research and development 
we have historically invested heavily in research and development to expand our expertise in tmn based software solutions applications technologies and to continue sustaining support of our product offerings 
through our expersoft acquisition  we added corba technology to our network management solutions and intend to develop embedded telecom specific implementations of this technology 
the major components of r d expenses are engineering salaries  employee benefits and associated overhead  fees to outside contractors  the cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment  which consists primarily of computer and test equipment 
costs related to r d in certain cases are offset by customer reimbursement of non recurring engineering efforts 
total r d expenses increased to  in from  in and increased in from  in as a percentage of revenue  r d expenses increased to in  as compared to in and in the increase in r d expenses during was primarily the result of the addition of expersoft s product development organization  as well as a lower charge back to cost of revenues for non recurring engineering services 
these increases were partially offset by reduced payroll  consulting and related costs of tmn product development during the year  which was primarily the result of the restructuring announced in october 
the increase in r d expense in as compared to was primarily the result of additional salaries and related expenses due to additional personnel and an increase in the average level of compensation  as well as a lower charge back to cost of revenues for non recurring engineering services 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce operating costs  and reduced our overall workforce by approximately 
the tmn product development staff in our headquarters accounted for approximately half of the headcount reduction 
we intend to transition future tmn product development to our poland operations  where our costs are lower 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and feature enhancements to existing product lines but anticipate that expenditures are likely to be lower in future periods 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and associated costs related to selling  and marketing activities  including marketing programs such as trade shows and other promotional costs 
we believe that substantial sales and marketing expenditures are essential to developing the opportunities for revenue growth and to sustaining our competitive position 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in and decreased in from  in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was due primarily to increased personnel and the associated payroll  commissions  recruiting  relocation and travel costs  consulting expenses  increased costs of trade shows  public relations  advertising  and the addition of expersoft s sales and marketing organization 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in as compared to  and decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in due to lower promotional expenses for trade shows during compared to the in addition  sales salaries  commissions  and related expenses in the period were lower as a result of certain staff reductions which occurred during sales and marketing expenses are expected to continue to comprise a significant percentage of our total expenses because of costs associated with supporting the worldwide sales and service functions necessary to meet the needs of our customer base and respond to the opportunities in the corba and tmn marketplaces 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  rent and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel as well as professional fees  investor relations costs and insurance premiums 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in as compared to  in  and decreased in from  in the increase in is primarily due to the addition of the expersoft general and administrative organization  increased professional and consulting fees  and a non recurring charge related to the value of stock options granted to three former officers in january 
these increases were partially offset by lower recruiting fees 
the decrease in as compared to was due primarily to the elimination of certain corporate overhead expenses incurred in when we had a holding company structure to oversee the operations of our subsidiaries  including sonoma systems 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization for was  compared to zero in and goodwill resulted from the purchase of expersoft in march of and is being amortized over five years at approximately  per quarter  annualized 
restructuring expense 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce operating costs  and reduced our overall workforce by employees 
the workforce reduction was concentrated in r d but impacted all areas 
the estimated costs of restructuring recorded in the financial statements for the year ended december  were  and included costs of employee severance pay  and the costs of vacating a facility 
of these costs   was paid in it is anticipated that severance costs amounting to  will be paid in the first quarter of at december   facility reserves totaled  additionally  during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a benefit of  upon the reversal of certain restructuring reserves originally recorded in and  resulting in a net restructuring expense recorded for fiscal of  in december  we announced plans to discontinue investment in our broadband access equipment subsidiary  sonoma systems 
as a result  our management structure was reorganized and downsized by three officers to reflect the reduction of the number of operating subsidiaries to one 
the estimated costs of restructuring recorded in the financial statements for the year ended december  were  and included costs of officer severance pay  acceleration of vesting for certain officer and director stock options  facility consolidation  professional fees and other related charges 
these costs were paid in except for  related to facility reserves 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reversal of certain restructuring reserves and accruals originally recorded in totaling  resulting in a net restructuring expense recorded for fiscal of  loss from continuing operations 
we incurred a loss from continuing operations of  in   in  and  in the increase in loss from continuing operations in as compared to was due to a combination of lower margins and higher operating expenses 
the decrease in loss from continuing operations in as compared to is primarily attributable to the restructuring expense in  as the reductions in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are partially offset by the lower gross margin and increased research and development costs 
other income  net 
in  other income  net decreased by  to  as compared to  for and increased  in from  in interest income increased by  in  primarily as a result of higher cash balances  but this increase was more than offset by the gain on sale  in december of our holdings of series b and series c preferred stock in sonoma systems a former subsidiary  the non recurring gain on the sale of our cdpd and pact technologies  the non recurring gain on the sale of a certain software library and the assignment of certain assets and liabilities of our atn operations  both in the third quarter of  and by the non recurring gain of approximately  to reflect curtailment of a non us pension plan that previously covered our irish employees that was recorded in the first three quarters of other income  net  of  in was primarily interest income 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  in due to the expiration of certain tax contingencies 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  on pre tax income from continuing operations of  in no income tax benefit was recognized on pre tax losses from continuing operations of  in or on pre tax losses from continuing operations of  in our tax provision was positively impacted by the utilization of approximately  of net operating losses carried forward from prior years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted rates 
a valuation allowance equal to the total amount of our net deferred tax assets of  at december   has been established 
the net deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent that we operate profitably in the future during the respective carryforward periods 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities during was  compared to  provided by operating activities during and  used for operating activities in the negative cash flow from operations in was comprised primarily of a loss from continuing operations  and increases in accounts receivable  and deferred revenue 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
the cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of the proceeds from the sale of our cdpd and pact technologies  non cash depreciation and amortization  a decrease in accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses and other current assets  and an increase in accrued taxes 
these amounts were partially offset by payments in of restructuring expenses that were accrued in 
the negative cash flow from operating activities in was comprised primarily of the net loss from continuing operations  and an increase in accounts receivable 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
net cash used for investing activities was  in and net cash provided by investing activities was  and  for and  respectively 
the net cash used for investing activities in was due to net purchases of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment  and cash paid for the acquisition of expersoft  net of cash acquired  which was partially offset by a decrease in other assets of  the net cash provided in was primarily due to the sale of our holdings of series b and series c preferred stock of sonoma systems  which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment  and net purchases of short term investments 
the net cash provided in was primarily due to sales of short term investments  and a reduction in other assets  which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  for  and  respectively 
the net cash provided in was due to the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans  which was partially offset by payments of capital lease obligations 
the net cash provided in was primarily due to the private placement of common stock  and the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans 
the net cash provided in was due to the exercise of stock options and stock sales under the employee stock purchase plans  and cash received as the result of the repayment of certain notes receivable originally issued from the exercise of certain stock options 
no net cash was provided by or used for discontinued operations in net cash provided by or used for discontinued operations was  and  and  respectively 
we believe that cash and short term investment balances  at december  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may also consider the acquisitions of  or evaluate investments in  certain products and businesses complementary to our business 
any such acquisitions or investments may require additional capital resources 
the company anticipates expenditures for capital equipment will approximate  for the year ending december  at december   our long term liquidity needs consisted principally of operating lease commitments related to facilities and office equipment 
european monetary union in january  eleven european countries  including france  germany and the netherlands  where we maintain operations  implemented a single currency the euro to replace their separate currencies 
while transactions may still be consummated in the individual currencies of the member countries  we will be required to  and are currently in the process of  implementing modifications to our payroll and benefits systems as well as our contracts and other obligations in order to accommodate the euro 
we do not currently believe that we will incur a material financial expense in connection with such modifications 
the introduction of the euro  presents certain risks for us including  risks associated with our reduced ability to adjust pricing of our products based on local currencies  fluctuations in the euro based on economic turmoil in countries other than those in which we do business and other risks normally associated with doing business in international currencies  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk with respect to our investments in equity securities and in the areas of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the following discussion about our market risk contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our short term investments 
to manage this risk we maintain an investment policy that limits our investments to short term  highly rated  fixed income facilities such as highly liquid municipal bonds and high grade commercial paper 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor and by placing our portfolio under the management of professional money managers who invest within specified parameters established by the board of directors 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
historically  the effect of interest rate risk on us has not been significant 
we had short term investments of  with a weighted average variable rate of  as of december  and  with a weighted average variable rate of  as of december  although these short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of less than days  they are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a basis point change in interest rates at december  would have resulted in a change in fair market value of less than  we are also exposed to interest rate risks on our fixed rate debt obligations 
at december   we had  of short term fixed rate debt 
there was no fixed rate debt outstanding at december  a hypothetical fluctuation in market interest rates by from the december  and rates would have caused the fair value of our fixed rate debt to fluctuate by an insignificant amount 
foreign exchange risk while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  a portion of our worldwide operations have a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
in particular  we maintain operations in france  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  poland and the united kingdom  where the functional currencies are french franc  deutschemark  yen  won  dutch guilder  zloty and british pound  respectively 
most of our revenues are denominated in the united states dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date  exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our earnings and we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
we do not have a policy relating to hedging 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by us would be successful or that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
our foreign assets are not material
