item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on april   constellation energy r group  inc constellation energy became the holding company for baltimore gas and electric company bge r and constellation r enterprises  inc constellation enterprises was previously owned by bge 
constellation energy s subsidiaries primarily include bge and a group of energy services businesses focused mostly on power marketing and merchant generation in north america 
bge is an electric and gas public utility company with a service territory that covers the city of baltimore and all or part of ten counties in central maryland 
our energy services businesses are

constellation real estate group  tm inc real estate and senior living facilities 
this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
the consolidated financial statements of constellation energy include the accounts of constellation energy  bge and its subsidiaries  constellation enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries  and constellation nuclear group  llc and its subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements of bge include the accounts of bge  comfortlink  and bge capital trust i 
as constellation enterprises and its subsidiaries were subsidiaries of bge prior to april   they are included in the consolidated financial statements of bge through that date 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the utility business are to bge 
in this discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including 
what factors affect our business  
what our earnings and costs were in and  
why earnings and costs changed from the year before  
where our earnings came from  
how all of this affects our overall financial condition  
what our expenditures for capital projects were in through  and what we expect them to be in through  and 
where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods by operating segment 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investments in constellation energy and or bge 
also  this discussion and analysis is based on the operation of the electric generation portion of our utility business under current rate regulation 
the electric utility industry is undergoing rapid and substantial change 
on april   maryland enacted legislation authorizing customer choice and competition among electric suppliers 
on november   the maryland public service commission maryland psc issued order no 
restructuring order approving a stipulation and settlement agreement between bge and a majority of the active parties involved in the electric restructuring proceeding that resolves the major issues surrounding electric restructuring 
see the electric restructuring section and note for a detailed discussion of the restructuring order 
our electric business will change significantly beginning july  as we enter into retail customer choice for electric generation and our generation assets are transferred to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 
accordingly  the results of operations and financial condition described in this discussion and analysis are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
strategy the change toward customer choice will significantly impact our business going forward 
in response to this change  we regularly evaluate our strategies with two goals in mind to improve our competitive position  and to anticipate and adapt to regulatory change 
we are realigning our organization combining all of our domestic merchant energy businesses 
we will continue to invest in the growth of these businesses  with the objective of providing new sources of earnings 
in addition  we might consider one or more of the following strategies 
the complete or partial separation of our transmission and distribution functions  
the construction  purchase or sale of generation assets  
mergers or acquisitions of utility or non utility businesses  
spin off or sale of one or more businesses  and 
growth of earnings from other nonregulated businesses 
we cannot predict whether any of the strategies described above may actually occur  or what their effect on our financial results or competitive position might be 
however  with the shift toward customer choice  competition  and the growth of our nonregulated subsidiaries  various factors will affect our financial results in the future 
these factors include  but are not limited to  operating our currently regulated generation assets in a deregulated market beginning july  without the benefit of a fuel rate adjustment clause  the loss of revenues due to customers choosing alternate suppliers  higher volatility of earnings and cash flows  and increased financial requirements of our nonregulated subsidiaries 
please refer to the forward looking statements section for additional factors 
current issues competition electric electric utilities are facing competition on various fronts  including 
construction of generating units to meet increased demand for electricity  
sale of electricity in bulk power markets  
competing with alternative energy suppliers  and 
electric sales to retail customers 
on april   maryland enacted legislation authorizing customer choice and competition among electric suppliers 
in addition  on november   the maryland psc issued a restructuring order that resolved the major issues surrounding electric restructuring 
these matters are discussed further in the electric restructuring section and note as a result of the deregulation of bge s electric generation  no earlier than july   and upon receipt of all regulatory approvals  we expect that bge will transfer  at book value  its nuclear generating assets and its nuclear decommissioning trust fund to a subsidiary of constellation nuclear group  llc 
in addition  we expect that bge will transfer  at book value  its fossil generating assets and its partial ownership interest in two coal plants and a hydroelectric plant located in pennsylvania to a nonregulated subsidiary of constellation energy 
in total  these generating assets represent about  megawatts of generation capacity with a total projected net book value at june  of approximately billion 
we expect bge to transfer approximately million of tax exempt debt to our nonregulated subsidiaries related to the transferred assets and that bge will receive approximately billion in unsecured promissory notes 
repayments of the notes by our nonregulated subsidiaries will be used exclusively to service certain long term debt of bge 
bge will also transfer equity associated with the generating assets to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 
under the restructuring order  bge will provide standard offer service to customers at fixed rates over various time periods during the transition period for those customers that do not choose an alternate supplier once customer choice begins july  in addition  the electric fuel rate will be discontinued effective july  nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy will provide bge with the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations for the first three years of the transition period 
standard offer service will be competitively bid thereafter 
nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy will obtain the energy and capacity to supply bge s standard offer service obligations from the calvert cliffs nuclear power plant calvert cliffs and bge s former fossil plants  supplemented with energy purchased from the wholesale energy market as necessary 
our earnings will be exposed to the risks of the competitive wholesale electricity market to the extent that our nonregulated subsidiaries have to purchase energy and or capacity or generate energy to meet obligations to supply power to bge at market prices or costs  respectively  which may approach or exceed bge s standard offer service rates 
we will also be affected by operational risk  that is  the risk that a generating plant is not available to produce energy when the energy is required 
until july   we will continue to recover our cost of fuel and purchased energy through the electric fuel rate as long as the maryland psc finds that  among other things  we have kept the productive capacity of our generating plants at a reasonable level 
after july   any energy purchased to meet bge s load commitments will become a cost of doing business in the newly competitive marketplace 
therefore  if bge provides standard offer service at fixed rates to its customers that do not select an alternative provider as required under the terms of the restructuring order  and the load demand exceeds our capacity to supply energy due to a plant outage  nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy would be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale energy market 
if the price of obtaining energy in the wholesale market exceeds the fixed standard offer service price  our earnings would be adversely affected 
imbalances in demand and supply can occur not only because of plant outages  but also because of transmission constraints or due to extreme temperatures hot or cold causing demand to exceed available supply 
we will use appropriate risk management techniques consistent with our business plan and policies to address these issues 
we cannot estimate the impact of the increased financial risks associated with this transition 
however  these financial risks could have a material impact on our  and bge s  financial results 
competition gas currently  no regulation exists for the wholesale price of natural gas as a commodity  and the regulation of interstate transmission at the federal level has been reduced 
all bge industrial and commercial gas customers  and effective november   all bge residential customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
early retirement program in recognition of the changing business environment  in  our board of directors approved a targeted voluntary special early retirement program tvserp to provide enhanced early retirement benefits to certain eligible participants in targeted jobs that elect to retire on june  the financial impacts of the tvserp will be reflected in the second quarter of calvert cliffs license extension in  we filed an application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for a year license extension for calvert cliffs to extend its license beyond for unit and for unit license renewal evaluations focus on age related issues in long lived passive components passive components include buildings  the reactor vessel  piping  ventilation ducts  electric cables  etc we must demonstrate that we can ensure that these passive components will continue to perform their intended functions through the renewal period 
the nrc will also consider the impact of the year license extension on the environment 
according to the nrc s timetable  approval of bge s application is expected in april however  we cannot predict the actual timing of the nrc s decision  or the impact  if any  on our financial results 
if we do not receive the license extension  we may not be able to operate the calvert cliffs units beyond and bge is currently involved in a lawsuit titled national whistleblower center v 
nuclear regulatory commission and baltimore gas and electric company regarding its license extension process 
the matter involves an appeal of the nrc s dismissal of whistleblower s petition to intervene in the license renewal proceeding 
at issue was the nrc s adoption of a streamlined procedure for the proceeding  including the requirement that any requests for extensions of time be justified by a showing of unavoidable and extreme circumstances rather than the good cause standard previously applied 
applying the new standard  the nrc ultimately dismissed whistleblower s petition to intervene 
oral arguments have been held and a decision from the court is pending 
environmental and legal matters you will find details of our environmental matters in note and under item business environmental matters 
you will find details of our legal matters under item legal proceedings 
some of the information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
year we did not experience any significant problems associated with the year issue 
accounting standards issued we discuss recently issued accounting standards in note results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments 
overview total earnings per share of common stock utility business diversified businesses 


total earnings per share before nonrecurring charges included in operations nonrecurring charges included in operations hurricane floyd see note 
write off of merger costs see note 
write downs of power projects see note 
write off of energy services investment see note 
write down of financial investment see note 
write downs of real estate and senior living investments see note and note 


total earnings per share before extraordinary item extraordinary loss see note 
total earnings per share our total earnings decreased million  or 
per share  compared to our total earnings decreased mostly because we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  or 
per share  associated with the deregulation of the electric generation portion of our business 
our total earnings also include nonrecurring write downs recorded in our power projects  financial investments  and real estate and senior living businesses 
these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings from utility and diversified business operations excluding nonrecurring charges 
we discuss the extraordinary charge in note in  we had higher utility earnings before the extraordinary charge compared to mostly because we sold more electricity and gas this year  and we settled a capacity contract with peco energy company in that had a negative impact on earnings in that year 
this increase was partially offset by storm restoration activities related to hurricane floyd and higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to the million  or million after tax  amortization of the regulatory asset recorded in for the reduction of our generation plant under the restructuring order 
we discuss our utility earnings and the restructuring order in more detail in the utility business section 
in  diversified business earnings before nonrecurring charges increased compared to mostly because of higher earnings from our power marketing business 
we discuss our diversified business earnings  including the write downs  further in the diversified businesses section 
our total earnings increased million  or 
per share  compared to our total earnings increased mostly because results reflect our write off of costs associated with the terminated merger with potomac electric power company  and our real estate and senior living facilities business write down of its investments in two real estate projects 
this increase was partially offset by 
our real estate and senior living facilities business write down of its investment in a real estate project in  and 
the write off of an energy services investment in in  utility earnings were about the same compared to in  diversified business earnings before nonrecurring charges decreased compared to mostly because of lower earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities and financial investments businesses 
this decrease was partially offset by higher earnings from our power projects and power marketing businesses 
utility business before we go into the details of our electric and gas operations  we believe it is important to discuss factors that have a strong influence on our utility business performance electric restructuring  regulation by the maryland psc  the weather  and other factors  including the condition of the economy in our service territory 
electric restructuring on april   maryland enacted the electric customer choice and competition act of the act and accompanying tax legislation that will significantly restructure maryland s electric utility industry and modify the industry s tax structure 
in the restructuring order discussed below  the maryland psc addressed the major provisions of the act 
the accompanying tax legislation is discussed in detail in note on november   the maryland psc issued a restructuring order that resolves the major issues surrounding electric restructuring  accelerates the timetable for customer choice  and addresses the major provisions of the act 
the restructuring order also resolves the electric restructuring proceeding transition costs  customer price protections  and unbundled rates for electric services and a petition filed in september by the office of people s counsel opc to lower our electric base rates 
the major provisions of the restructuring order are 
all customers  except a few commercial and industrial companies that have signed contracts with bge  will be able to choose their electric energy supplier beginning july  bge will provide a standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative supplier 
in either case  bge will continue to deliver electricity to all customers in areas traditionally served by bge 

bge s current electric base rates are frozen at their current levels until july  
bge will reduce residential base rates by approximately on average  about million a year  beginning july  these rates will not change before july 
commercial and industrial customers will have up to four service options that will fix electric energy rates and transition charges for a period that generally ranges from four to six years 

electric delivery service rates will be frozen for a four year period for commercial and industrial customers 
the generation and transmission components of rates will be frozen for different time periods depending on the service options selected by those customers 

bge will be allowed to recover million after tax of its potentially stranded investments and utility restructuring costs through a competitive transition charge on customers bills 
residential customers will pay this charge for six years 
commercial and industrial customers will pay in a lump sum or over the four to six year period  depending on the service option selected by each customer 

generation related regulatory assets and nuclear decommissioning costs will be included in delivery service rates effective july  and will be recovered on a basis approximating their existing amortization schedules 

starting july   bge will unbundle rates to show separate components for delivery service  transition charges  standard offer service generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 

on july   bge will transfer  at book value  its ten maryland based fossil and nuclear power plants and its partial ownership interest in two coal plants and a hydroelectric plant in pennsylvania to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 

bge will reduce its generation assets  as discussed in note  by million pre tax during the period july  june  to mitigate a portion of its potentially stranded investments 

universal service will be provided for low income customers without increasing their bills 
bge will provide its share of a statewide fund totaling million annually 
we believe that the restructuring order provided sufficient details of the transition plan to competition for bge s electric generation business to require bge to discontinue the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation for that portion of its business 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of fasb statement no 
and emerging issues task force consensus eitf no 
 deregulation of the pricing of electricity issues related to the application of fasb statements no 
and for bge s electric generation business 
bge s transmission and distribution business continues to meet the requirements of sfas no 
as that business remains regulated 
we describe the effect of applying these accounting requirements in note in early december  the mid atlantic power supply association mapsa  trigen baltimore energy corporation  and sweetheart cup company  inc filed appeals of the restructuring order 
mapsa also filed a motion seeking to delay the implementation of the restructuring order pending a decision on the merits by the court 
while we believe that the appeals are without merit  no assurances can be given as to the timing or outcome of these cases  and whether the outcome will have a material adverse effect on our and bge s financial results 
regulation by the maryland psc under traditional rate regulation that will continue for all bge s businesses except electric generation beginning july   the maryland psc determines the rate we can charge our customers 
our rates consist of a base rate  a conservation surcharge  and a fuel rate 
base rate the base rate is the rate the maryland psc allows us to charge our customers for the cost of providing them service  plus a profit 
we have both an electric base rate and a gas base rate 
higher electric base rates apply during the summer when the demand for electricity is higher 
gas base rates are not affected by seasonal changes 
except as provided under the terms of the electric restructuring order discussed earlier  bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover increased utility plant asset costs  plus a profit  beginning at the time of replacement 
generally  rate increases improve our utility earnings because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
on november   bge filed an application with the maryland psc to increase its gas base rates 
we discuss this filing in the gas base rates section 
conservation surcharge the maryland psc allows us to include in electric and gas rates a component to recover money spent on conservation programs 
this component is called a conservation surcharge 
however  under this surcharge the maryland psc limits what our profit can be 
if at the end of the year we have exceeded our allowed profit  we defer include as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and exclude from our consolidated statements of income the excess in that year and we lower the amount of future surcharges to our customers to correct the amount of overage  plus interest 
as a result of the restructuring order  the electric conservation surcharge was frozen at its current level and the associated profit limitation is no longer applicable 
fuel rate currently  we charge our electric customers separately for the fuel we use to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and for the net cost of purchases and sales of electricity 
we charge the actual cost of these items to the customer with no profit to us 
if these costs go up  the maryland psc permits us to increase the fuel rate 
if these costs go down  our customers benefit from a reduction in the fuel rate 
the fuel rate is mostly impacted by the amount of electricity generated at calvert cliffs because the cost of nuclear fuel is cheaper than coal  gas  or oil 
under the restructuring order  bge s electric fuel rate is frozen at its current level until july   at which time the fuel rate clause will be discontinued 
we will continue to defer the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collect from customers under the fuel rate through june  after that date  earnings will be affected by the changes in the cost of fuel and energy 
we discuss our exposure to market risk further in the current issues section 
in addition  any accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers under the electric fuel rate clause will be collected from our customers over a period to be determined by the maryland psc 
at december   the amount to be collected from customers was million 
we charge our gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase from us 
the price we charge for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the gas cost adjustments section and in note weather weather affects the demand for electricity and gas 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather impacts residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
we measure the weather s effect using degree days 
a degree day is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of degrees 
cooling degree days result when the average daily actual temperature exceeds the degree baseline 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the baseline 
during the cooling season  hotter weather is measured by more cooling degree days and results in greater demand for electricity to operate cooling systems 
during the heating season  colder weather is measured by more heating degree days and results in greater demand for electricity and gas to operate heating systems 
effective march   the maryland psc allowed us to implement a monthly adjustment to our gas business revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns 
we discuss this further in the weather normalization section 
we show the number of cooling and heating degree days in and  the percentage change in the number of degree days from the prior year  and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by the year average in the following table 
year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year heating degree days    percentage change from prior year other factors other factors  aside from weather  impact the demand for electricity and gas 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during and the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
when customer choice for electric generation begins on july   a portion of bge s electric customers will become delivery service customers only and will purchase their electricity from other sources 
other electric customers will receive standard offer service from bge at the fixed rates provided by the restructuring order 
to the extent our electricity generation exceeds or is less than the electricity demanded by customers utilizing our standard offer service  the incremental electricity will be sold or purchased in the wholesale market at prevailing market prices 
we discuss our exposure to market risk further in the current issues section 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downtrend  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas

electric operations the discussion below reflects the operations of the electric generation portion of our utility business under current rate regulation by the maryland psc 
our electric business will change significantly beginning july  as we enter into retail customer choice for electric generation 
also  no earlier than july   and upon receipt of all regulatory approvals  all of bge s generation assets will be transferred  at book value  to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 
these assets represent about  megawatts of generation capacity with a total projected net book value at june  of approximately billion 
we estimate that the electric generation portion of our business currently represents about one half of bge s operating income 
we expect bge to transfer approximately million of tax exempt debt to our nonregulated subsidiaries related to the transferred assets and that bge will receive approximately billion in unsecured promissory notes 
repayments of the notes by our nonregulated subsidiaries will be used exclusively to service certain long term debt of bge 
bge will also transfer equity associated with the generating assets to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 
given the uncertainties surrounding electric deregulation as discussed in the strategy and current issues sections  the results discussed in this section may not be indicative of the future performance of our generation business 
also  these results will not be indicative of the future performance of bge once bge transfers all of its generation assets to nonregulated subsidiaries of constellation energy 
the impact of this transfer on bge s financial results will be material 
the total assets  liabilities  and common shareholders equity of constellation energy will not change as a result of the transfer 
electric revenues the changes in electric revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions electric system sales volumes base rates fuel rates total change in electric revenues from electric system sales interchange and other sales other total change in electric revenues electric system sales volumes electric system sales volumes are sales to customers in our service territory at rates set by the maryland psc 
these sales do not include interchange sales and sales to others 
the percentage changes in our electric system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we sold more electricity to residential customers due to higher usage per customer  colder winter weather  and an increased number of customers 
this increase was partially offset by milder spring and early summer weather 
we sold more electricity to commercial customers mostly due to higher usage per customer  an increased number of customers  and colder winter weather 
we sold less electricity to industrial customers mostly because usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers decreased 
usage decreased at bethlehem steel as a result of a shut down from june to august for an upgrade to their facilities that temporarily reduced their electricity consumption 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of industrial customers 
in  we sold more electricity to residential customers mostly because of an increased number of customers  hotter summer weather  and higher usage per customer 
the increase in sales to residential customers was partially offset by milder winter weather 
we sold more electricity to commercial customers mostly because of higher usage per customer 
we sold about the same amount of electricity to industrial customers as we did in base rates in  base rate revenues were about the same compared to in  base rate revenues decreased compared to although we sold more electricity in  our base rate revenues decreased because of lower conservation surcharge revenues 
fuel rates in  fuel rate revenues increased compared to mostly because we sold more electricity 
in  fuel rate revenues decreased compared to although we sold more electricity  the fuel rate was lower mostly because we were able to use a less costly mix of generating plants and electricity purchases 
interchange and other sales interchange and other sales are sales in the pjm pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection energy market and to others 
the pjm is the operator of a regional transmission organization as well as a regional power pool with members that include many wholesale market participants  as well as bge and other utility companies 
we sell energy to pjm members and to others after we have satisfied the demand for electricity in our own system 
in and  interchange and other sales revenues decreased compared to the respective prior year mostly because higher demand for system sales reduced the amount of energy we had available for off system sales 
electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in millions actual costs net deferral recovery of costs under electric fuel rate clause see note total electric fuel and purchased energy expenses actual costs in  our actual costs of fuel to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and electricity we bought from others were higher compared to mostly because the price of electricity we bought from others was higher 
the price of electricity changes based on market conditions and contract terms 
this increase was partially offset by our settlement of a capacity contract with peco in in  our actual costs increased compared to mostly because we settled a capacity contract with peco 
electric fuel rate clause under the electric fuel rate clause  we defer include as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets and exclude from our consolidated statements of income the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collect from customers under the fuel rate in a given period 
we either bill or refund our customers that difference in the future 
we discuss the calculation of the fuel rate and its future discontinuance in note in and  our actual costs of fuel and energy were higher than the fuel rate revenues we collected from our customers 
the increase in the deferral reflects higher purchased power costs  especially during record setting summer peak loads 
electric operations and maintenance expenses in  electric operations and maintenance expenses were about the same compared to in  operations and maintenance expenses include the costs for system restoration activities related to hurricane floyd of million and a major winter ice storm 
this was offset by lower employee benefit costs in and a million write off of contributions to a third party for a low level radiation waste facility that was never completed 
in  electric operations and maintenance expenses increased million compared to mostly because of 
higher nuclear costs  
higher employee benefit costs  and 
the million write off for the low level radiation waste facility discussed above 
electric depreciation and amortization expense in  electric depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to mostly because of the million amortization of the regulatory asset for the reduction in generation plant provided for in the restructuring order 
this increase was partially offset by lower amortization of deferred electric conservation expenditures due to the write off of a portion of these expenditures that will not be recovered under the restructuring order 
we discuss the accounting implications of the restructuring order further in note in  electric depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to mostly because 
in october  the maryland psc authorized us to implement new electric depreciation rates retroactive to january   which increased depreciation expense by approximately million  
we had more electric plant in service as our level of plant in service changes  the amount of our depreciation and amortization expense changes  and 
we reduced the amortization period for certain computer software beginning in the first quarter of from five years to three years 
gas operations all bge industrial and commercial gas customers  and effective november   all bge residential customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
we do not expect the impact of customer choice to have a material effect on our  and bge s  financial results 
gas revenues the changes in gas revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions gas system sales volumes base rates weather normalization gas cost adjustments total change in gas revenues from gas system sales off system sales other total change in gas revenues gas system sales volumes the percentage changes in our gas system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we sold more gas to residential customers mostly for two reasons colder winter weather and an increased number of customers 
this was partially offset by lower usage per customer 
we sold more gas to commercial customers mostly because of higher usage per customer  colder winter weather  and an increased number of customers 
we sold less gas to industrial customers mostly because of lower usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers 
usage by bethlehem steel decreased due to a shut down from june to august for an upgrade to their facilities 
in  we sold less gas to residential and commercial customers mostly for two reasons milder weather and lower usage per customer 
this was partially offset by the increase in the number of customers 
we sold less gas to industrial customers mostly because of lower usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers 
base rates in  base rate revenues increased compared to mostly due to the increase in our base rates effective march  as discussed below 
in  base rate revenues increased compared to although we sold less gas during  our base rate revenues increased mostly because the maryland psc authorized an increase in our base rates effective march  the change in rates increased our base rate revenues over the twelve month period from march through february by approximately million 
on november   we applied for a million annual increase in our gas base rates 
the maryland psc is currently reviewing our application and is expected to issue an order by june weather normalization effective march   the maryland psc allowed us to implement a monthly adjustment to our gas revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns on our gas system sales volumes 
this means our monthly gas revenues will be based on weather that is considered normal for the month and  therefore  will not be affected by actual weather conditions 
gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc 
these clauses operate similarly to the electric fuel rate clause described in the electric fuel rate clause section 
however  under market based rates  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers  and does not significantly impact earnings 
we also discuss this in note delivery service customers  including bethlehem steel  are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
we charge these customers fees to recover the fixed costs for the transportation service we provide 
these fees are the same as the base rate charged for gas sales and are included in gas system sales volumes 
in  gas cost adjustment revenues increased compared to the same period of mostly because we sold more gas at a higher price 
in  gas cost adjustment revenues decreased compared to mostly because we sold less gas 
off system sales off system gas sales are low margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas outside our service territory 
off system gas sales  which occur after we have satisfied our customers demand  are not subject to gas cost adjustments 
the maryland psc approved an arrangement for part of the margin from off system sales to benefit customers through reduced costs and the remainder to be retained by bge which benefits shareholders 
changes in off system sales do not significantly impact earnings 
in  revenues from off system gas sales decreased compared to mostly because we sold less gas off system 
in  revenues from off system gas sales increased compared to mostly because we sold more gas off system 
gas purchased for resale expenses in millions actual costs net recovery deferral of costs under gas adjustment clauses see note total gas purchased for resale expenses actual costs actual costs include the cost of gas purchased for resale to our customers and for off system sales 
actual costs do not include the cost of gas purchased by delivery service customers 
in  actual gas costs increased compared to mostly because we sold more gas 
in  actual gas costs decreased compared to mostly because we sold less gas 
gas adjustment clauses we charge customers for the cost of gas sold through gas adjustment clauses determined by the maryland psc  as discussed under gas cost adjustments earlier in this section

total earnings per share 


our diversified business earnings increased million  or 
per share  compared to our diversified business earnings increased million  or 
per share  compared to we discuss factors affecting the earnings of our diversified businesses below 
energy services power marketing in  earnings from our power marketing business increased compared to because of increased transaction margins and volume 
in  earnings from our power marketing business increased compared to because of increased power marketing activities in  which was constellation power source s first full year of operations 
constellation power source uses the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss the mark to market method of accounting and constellation power source s activities in note as a result of the nature of its business activities  constellation power source s revenue and earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the effect on our revenues and earnings could be material 
the primary factors that cause these fluctuations are 
the number and size of new transactions  
the magnitude and volatility of changes in commodity prices and interest rates  and 
the number and size of open commodity and derivative positions constellation power source holds or sells 
constellation power source s management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative positions it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is possible that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from power marketing and trading activities  and such variations could be material 
in  assets and liabilities from energy trading activities as shown in our consolidated balance sheets increased because of greater business activity during the period 
in march  we formed orion power holdings  inc orion with goldman  sachs capital partners ii lp  an affiliate of goldman  sachs co  to acquire electric generating plants in the united states and canada 
our energy services businesses own a minority interest in orion 
to date  our energy services businesses have funded million in equity and have a commitment to contribute an additional million to orion 
power projects in  earnings from our power projects business decreased compared to mostly because of three factors 
in  our power projects business recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write off of two geothermal power projects 
these write offs occurred because the expected future cash flows from the projects are less than the investment in the projects 
for the first project  this resulted from the inability to restructure certain project agreements 
for the second project  we experienced a declining water temperature of the geothermal resource used by one of the plants for production 

in  our power projects business recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write down to reflect the fair value of our investment in a power project as a result of our international exit strategy as discussed later in this section 

in  our power projects business recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  gain for its share of earnings in a partnership 
the partnership recognized a gain on the sale of its ownership interest in a power purchase agreement 
in  earnings from our power projects business increased compared to mostly because constellation power recorded a million after tax gain for its share of earnings in a partnership as discussed above 
california power purchase agreements constellation power and subsidiaries and constellation investments have million invested in projects that sell electricity in california under power purchase agreements called interim standard offer no 
agreements 
in  earnings from these projects  excluding any write offs  were million  or 
per share  compared to million  or 
per share in under these agreements  the electricity rates change from fixed rates to variable rates beginning in and continuing through the projects which already have had rate changes have lower revenues under variable rates than they did under fixed rates 
when the remaining projects transition to variable rates  we expect their revenues also to be lower than they are under fixed rates 
as of december   ten projects had already transitioned to variable rates 
the remaining four projects will transition between february and december the projects which transitioned in contributed million  or 
per share to earnings 
those changing over in contributed million  or 
per share to earnings 
we expect earnings from the projects changing over in to contribute million  or 
per share to earnings 
our power projects business continues to pursue alternatives for some of these projects including 
repowering the projects to reduce operating costs  
changing fuels to reduce operating costs  
renegotiating the power purchase agreements to improve the terms  
restructuring financing to improve existing terms  and 
selling its ownership interests in the projects 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our investment in these projects for impairment using the methodology discussed in note constellation power s management uses its best estimates to determine if there has been an impairment of these investments and considers various factors including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  it is possible that future estimates of market prices and project costs could vary from those used in evaluating these assets  and the impact of such variations could be material 
we also describe these projects and the transition process in note international projects at december   constellation power had invested about million in power projects in latin america compared to million invested in latin america in these investments include 
the purchase of a interest in a panamanian electric distribution company for approximately million in by an investment group in which subsidiaries of constellation power hold an interest  and 
approximately million for the purchase of existing electric generation facilities and the construction of an electric generation facility in guatemala 
in december  we decided to exit the international portion of our power projects business as part of our strategy to improve our competitive position 
as a result  we recorded a million after tax write down of our investment in a generating company in bolivia to reflect the current fair value of this investment 
we expect to complete our exit strategy by the end of we discuss our strategy further in the strategy section 
other energy services in  earnings from our other energy services businesses decreased compared to mostly because of lower gross margins at our energy products and services business 
in  earnings from our other energy services businesses increased compared to due to improved results from our energy products and services business 
earnings would have been higher except we recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write off of our investment in  and certain of our product inventory from  an automated electric distribution equipment company 
we recorded this write off because of that company s inability to raise capital and sell its products 
other diversified businesses in  earnings from our other diversified businesses increased compared to mostly because of higher earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities business 
this increase was partially offset by lower earnings from our financial investments business 
in  earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities business increased compared to mostly because of 
a million after tax write down of its investment in church street station  an entertainment  dining  and retail complex in orlando  florida in  and 
an increase in earnings from its investment in corporate office properties trust copt in we discuss the investment in copt below 
this increase was partially offset by a million after tax  or 
per share  write down of certain senior living facilities related to the proposed sale of these facilities in as discussed below 
in  our senior living facilities business entered into an agreement to sell all but one of its senior living facilities to sunrise assisted living  inc under the terms of the agreement  sunrise was to acquire of our existing senior living facilities  three facilities under construction  and several sites under development for million in cash and million in debt assumption 
we could not reach an agreement on financing issues that subsequently arose  and the agreement was terminated in november as a result  our senior living facilities business engaged a third party management company to manage its senior living facilities portfolio including the three facilities now under construction  scheduled to be completed in the first half of in  constellation real estate group  inc creg sold church street station  for million  the approximate book value of the complex 
in  our financial investments business announced that it would exchange its shares of common stock in capital re  an insurance company  for common stock of ace limited ace  another insurance company  as part of a business combination whereby ace would acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of capital re 
through september   our financial investments business wrote down its million investment in capital re stock by million after tax  or 
per share  to reflect the market value of this investment 
the agreement between ace and capital re was subsequently revised on a more favorable basis for capital re to include both cash and ace stock 
in december  the transaction was finalized and our financial investments business recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  gain on this investment to reflect the closing price of the business combination 
this net write down of capital re was partially offset by better market performance of other financial investments in compared to in  earnings from our other diversified businesses decreased compared to mostly due to lower earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities and financial investments businesses 
earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities business decreased mostly due to 
a million after tax write down of its investment in church street station  
lower earnings from various real estate and senior living facilities projects  and 
a million after tax gain on the sale of two senior living facilities projects reflected in results 
in addition  in  our real estate and senior living facilities business exchanged certain assets and liabilities in return for a equity interest in copt  a real estate investment trust 
in  earnings from our financial investments business decreased compared to mostly because of 
better market performance for its investments in  and 
a million after tax gain on the sale of stock held by a financial limited partnership reflected in results 
we discuss our real estate projects  the write downs of our real estate projects  the copt transaction  and our financial investments further in note most of creg s remaining real estate projects are in the baltimore washington corridor 
the area has had a surplus of available land in recent years and as a result these projects have been economically hurt 
constellation real estate s projects have continued to incur carrying costs and depreciation over the years 
additionally  this business has been charging interest payments to expense rather than capitalizing them for some undeveloped land where development activities have stopped 
these carrying costs  depreciation  and interest expenses have decreased earnings and are expected to continue to do so 
cash flow from real estate operations has not been enough to make the monthly loan payments on some of these projects 
cash shortfalls have been covered by cash obtained from the cash flows of other diversified subsidiaries 
we consider market demand  interest rates  the availability of financing  and the strength of the economy in general when making decisions about our real estate projects 
if we were to decide to sell our real estate projects  we could have write downs 
in addition  if we were to sell our real estate projects in the current market  we would have losses which could be material  although the amount of the losses is hard to predict 
depending on market conditions  we could also have material losses on any future sales 
our current real estate strategy is to hold each real estate project until we can realize a reasonable value for it 
we evaluate strategies for all our businesses  including real estate  on an ongoing basis 
we anticipate that competing demands for our financial resources and changes in the utility industry will cause us to evaluate thoroughly all business strategies on a regular basis so we use capital and other resources in a manner that is most beneficial 
under accounting rules  we are required to write down the value of a real estate project to market value in either of two cases 
the first is if we change our intent about a project from an intent to hold to an intent to sell and the market value of that project is below book value 
the second is if the expected future cash flow from the project is less than the investment in the project 
consolidated nonoperating income and expenses other income and expenses in september  we signed an agreement to merge with potomac electric power company after all necessary regulatory approvals were received 
in december  both companies mutually terminated the merger agreement 
accordingly  in  we wrote off million of costs related to the merger 
this write off reduced after tax earnings by million  or 
per share 
fixed charges in  fixed charges decreased million compared to mostly because we had less bge preference stock outstanding 
in  fixed charges increased million compared to mostly because we had more debt outstanding 
our fixed charges would have been higher except we had less bge preference stock outstanding and lower interest rates in compared to income taxes in  income taxes increased million compared to because we had higher taxable income from both our utility operations and our diversified businesses 
in  income taxes increased million compared to because we had higher taxable income from both our utility operations and our diversified businesses 
please refer to note for a discussion of tax law changes 
these changes are designed  in part  to tax maryland electric generating facilities on a more comparable basis with electric generation in other states 
financial condition cash flows in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities in and  cash provided by operations changed compared to the respective prior year mostly because of changes in working capital requirements 
in  we used less cash for investing activities compared to mostly due to lower investments in international power projects and in the real estate and senior living facilities business 
this was partially offset by 
our energy services businesses increased the investment in orion power holdings  inc by million  
our power projects business increased its investment in domestic power projects  primarily related to the megawatts of peaking capacity as discussed in the capital requirements of our diversified businesses section  and 
bge increased its construction expenditures by million 
in  net cash used in investing activities increased compared to mostly because of the additional investments in international power projects 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in utility construction expenditures 
total utility construction expenditures  including the allowance for funds used during construction  were million in as compared to million in and million in in  we used more cash for financing activities compared to mostly because we repaid more long term debt and issued less long term debt and common stock 
this was partially offset by a decrease in the redemption of bge preference stock and higher net short term borrowings in compared to in  cash used in financing activities was about the same compared to in  we issued more long term debt and common stock  and had contributions from minority interests of approximately million related to the acquisition of a distribution company in panama 
this was offset by the repayment of short term borrowings that matured  sinking fund requirements  and early redemption of higher cost securities 
security ratings independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy and bge s fixed income securities 
the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities

electric construction expenditures include improvements to generating plants and to our transmission and distribution facilities  and costs for replacing the steam generators and renewing the operating licenses at calvert cliffs 
the operating licenses expire in for unit and in for unit if we do not replace the steam generators  we may not be able to operate the calvert cliffs units beyond and we expect the steam generator replacements to occur during the refueling outage for unit and during the refueling outage for unit we discuss the license extension process further in the current issues section 
we estimate these calvert cliffs costs to be 
million in  
million in  
million in  and 
million in additionally  our estimates of future electric construction expenditures include the costs of complying with environmental protection agency epa and state of maryland nitrogen oxides emissions nox reduction regulations as follows 
million in  
million in  and 
million in we discuss the nox regulations and timing of expenses further in note our utility operations provided about in  in  and in of the cash needed to meet its capital requirements  excluding cash needed to retire debt and redeem preference stock 
during the three years from through  we expect our existing utility business to provide about of the cash needed to meet the capital requirements for these operations  excluding cash needed to retire debt 
the table for capital requirements includes the requirements for bge fossil and nuclear generation under utility business capital requirements electric through even though these assets are to be transferred to nonregulated subsidiaries on or about july  we will continue to have cash requirements for 
working capital needs including the payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  
capital expenditures  and 
the retirement of debt and redemption of preference stock 
when bge cannot meet utility capital requirements internally  bge sells debt and preference stock 
bge also sells securities when market conditions permit it to refinance existing debt or preference stock at a lower cost 
the amount of cash bge needs and market conditions determine when and how much bge sells 
future funding for capital expenditures  the retirement of debt  and payments of interest and dividends is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper issuances  available capacity under credit facilities  and or the issuance of long term debt  trust securities  or preference stock 
at december   the federal energy regulatory commission has authorized bge to issue up to million of short term borrowings  including commercial paper 
in addition  bge maintains million in annual committed bank lines of credit and has million in bank revolving credit agreements to support the commercial paper program as discussed in note in addition  bge has access to interim lines of credit as required from time to time to support its outstanding commercial paper

constructing cooling system projects 
our energy services businesses investment requirements include the planned construction of megawatts of peaking capacity in the mid atlantic mid west region by the summer of and an additional  megawatts of peaking and combined cycle production facilities scheduled for completion in and beyond 
our investment requirements also include our energy services businesses commitment to contribute up to an additional million in equity to orion 
to date  our energy services businesses have funded million in equity to orion 
our energy services businesses have met their capital requirements in the past through borrowing  cash from their operations  and from time to time equity contributions from bge 
future funding for the expansion of our energy services businesses is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper issuances and long term debt financing by constellation energy  and from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
bge home products services may also meet capital requirements through sales of receivables

comfortlink has a revolving credit agreement totaling million to provide liquidity for short term financial needs 
if we can get a reasonable value for our real estate projects  additional cash may be obtained by selling them 
our ability to sell or liquidate assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made 
we discuss the real estate business and market in the other diversified businesses section 
we discuss our short term borrowings in note and long term debt in note market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices  equity prices  and foreign currency 
to manage our market risk  we may enter into various derivative instruments including swaps  forward contracts  futures contracts  and options 
effective july   we will be subject to additional market risk associated with the purchase and sale of energy as discussed in the current issues section 
in this section  we discuss our current market risk and the related use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
the following table provides information about our obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date fair value at thereafter total dec 
 in millions long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt    average interest rate commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of natural gas  electricity  and other trading commodities 
currently  our gas business and energy services businesses use derivative instruments to manage changes in their respective commodity prices 
gas business our gas business may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program 
we discuss this further in note at december  and  our exposure to commodity price risk for our gas business was not material 
energy services businesses with respect to our energy services businesses  constellation power source manages its commodity price risk inherent in its power marketing activities on a portfolio basis  subject to established trading and risk management policies 
commodity price risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy commodities and related derivatives due to changes in commodity prices  volatility of commodity prices  and fluctuations in interest rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the electricity market significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for electricity and related derivative products 
these factors include 
seasonal changes in the demand for electricity  
hourly fluctuations in demand due to weather conditions  
available generation resources  
transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  and 
procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country and result from regional differences in 
weather conditions  
market liquidity  
capability and reliability of the physical electricity system  and 
the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
constellation power source uses various methods  including a value at risk model  to measure its exposure to market risk 
value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data 
constellation power source calculates value at risk using a variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  constellation power source estimates variances and correlation using historical market movements over the most recent rolling three month period 
the value at risk amount represents the potential loss in the fair value of assets and liabilities from trading activities over a one day holding period with a confidence level 
using this confidence level  constellation power source would expect a one day change in fair value greater than or equal to the daily value at risk at least once per year 
constellation power source s value at risk was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the average  high  and low value at risk for the year ended december  was million  million and million  respectively 
constellation power source s calculation includes all assets and liabilities from its power marketing and trading activities  including energy commodities and derivatives that do not require cash settlements 
we believe that this represents a more complete calculation of our value at risk 
due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk  the relative immaturity of the competitive market for electricity and related derivatives  and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the value at risk calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities from power marketing and trading activities could differ from the calculated value at risk and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
please refer to the forward looking statements section below 
we discuss constellation power source s business in the power marketing section and in note the commodity price risk for our remaining energy services businesses was not material at december  and equity price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets primarily through our financial investments business and our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
we are required by the nrc to maintain a trust to fund the costs of decommissioning calvert cliffs 
at december  and  equity price risk was not material 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust fund in more detail in note we also describe our financial investments in more detail in note foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through our power projects business 
our power projects business has million invested in international power generation and distribution projects as of december  to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk  the majority of our contracts are denominated in or indexed to the us dollar 
at december  and  foreign currency risk was not material 
we discuss our international projects in the power projects section
