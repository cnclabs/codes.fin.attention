item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations  year ended december  vs 
year ended december  consolidated revenues advanced over the prior year 
operating profit margins from continuing operations were in compared to in information technology services segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  advanced from the prior year 
operationally  the segment completed its first full year as a stand alone business unit 
prior to mid  the company s information technology services business was integrated with the company s technical services segment 
information technology services customer base consists principally of large  multi national manufacturing companies  much like the customer base of the company s technical services segment 
in and  one large industrial corporation comprised approximately of the segment s total revenues 
as a stand alone business unit  the segment has begun to broaden its customer and industry base and already has achieved a measure of success in the financial services industry 
demand began to moderate in the second half of within the segment s manufacturing oriented customer base as those customers faced global challenges in their markets 
during  many customers concerned with achieving year yk compliance responded by delaying discretionary information technology projects 
this softness was particularly evident during the fourth quarter of additionally  a tight labor supply  particularly for highly skilled information technology specialists  became even more acute in and this condition is not expected to subside substantially 
operating profit margins for information technology services were in compared to in during  the company anticipated strong revenue growth which did not keep pace with costs to build its management and support structure 
throughout  management carefully monitored its costs and transitioned from a regional management to a unified management structure and began implementation of standardized recruiting and career progression practices in all offices 
this effective emphasis on cost control  particularly during the second half of produced stronger operating profit margins than in technical services segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  increased from the prior year 
the segment s customer base consists principally of large  multi national manufacturing companies 
historically  its largest markets have been aerospace  automotive  construction  electronics  industrial equipment  petrochemicals  marine and telecommunications 
the segment has begun to penetrate the pharmaceuticals market  expand its level of business within telecommunications and is focusing on other new markets such as biotechnology  medical devices and food and beverage 
technical services revenue growth was moderated  in part  by continuing cyclical softness in the aerospace industry  reduced spending by certain key customers in the process of merger and increased contract selectivity and screening by technical services management 
operating profit margins for technical services were in compared to in the operating profit margins for are considered more reflective of this segment s overall historical performance 
in the second quarter of  technical services operating profit margin was impacted by reorganization costs and other non recurring charges of million 
excluding these charges in  the segment s operating profit margins would have been 
in addition  throughout  many technical services customers experienced a difficult business environment due to turbulent international market conditions  delayed new product introductions and investment imbalances 
this was particularly pronounced in the electronics and hydrocarbon petrochemicals customer base 
the improved results in reflect the higher margins associated with strengths in managed engineering services  targeted new market and product growth  increased contract selectivity and ongoing cost containment efforts 
information technology services and technical services many contracts are individually price negotiated  and as a result  the price to direct cost mix is constantly changing 
the cost structure of both segments is generally variable 
in periods of substantial increases in revenues  operating profit margins can widen because the segments can take advantage of certain economies of scale in the support cost structure 
conversely  in periods of declining demand  operating results can deteriorate quickly because realization of cost savings typically lags implementation of downsizing and cost reduction programs 
management recruiters revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  advanced over the prior year 
although positive  the segment s growth rate in was below the segment s rates of growth over the past several years 
the most important cause of this slowing of growth is the severe shortage of middle management and professional personnel candidates for permanent employment positions 
these shortages are expected to continue into additionally  a certain amount of disintermediation is taking place as candidates and employers bypass recruiting organizations in favor of direct contact via the internet 
this latter effect cannot be quantified with certainty 
operating profit margins for management recruiters were in and in the decline in the margin reflects a shift in fulfillment mix from large client project placement work to more labor intensive single transaction searches 
further  operating margins also declined as a result of start up costs for four new staffing offices 
todays staffing segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  advanced over the prior year 
todays staffing s customer base consists of a large number of retail accounts and a small number of large  wholesale accounts 
was a transitional year for this latter category of accounts 
in recent years  these large  multi location accounts have become more price sensitive  and the segment elected not to continue to pursue certain of these accounts when pricing began to erode 
conversely  the segment identified and won new  large contracts with a category of emerging middle market customers 
demand for office clerical and professional temporary services in remained strong 
legal staffing is a small but growing component of the segment s services 
todays staffing s operating profit margins were in both and operating profit in was adversely impacted by integration costs associated with today s acquisition of staffing consultants  inc and increased recruiting costs 
each of cdi s business segments has been an active and aggressive user of the internet as a candidate source since the inception of the very earliest of the job boards 
during  cdi formalized and broadened its relationship with leading internet staffing providers 
in recent years  the company has utilized its own corporate internet sites to generate candidate traffic 
in  cdi s management recruiters segment launched its own proprietary internet staffing site  brilliant people 
com  and early results are encouraging 
during the second and fourth quarters of  the company recorded gains from discontinued operations of  and  respectively  net of applicable income taxes 
these gains primarily reflected settlement of a disputed receivable which was fully reserved and adjustments of certain estimates 
in the fourth quarter of  a gain of  net of applicable income taxes  was recorded reflecting lower than anticipated costs related to the wind down of the discontinued operations and greater realization on disposal of assets than expected 
the liquidation of the discontinued operations is complete 
interest expense was million in compared to million in reflecting higher average levels of debt outstanding 
during the year ended december   each of the company s business segments made acquisitions for which the company invested collectively  the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
goodwill acquired amounted to  and is being amortized on the straight line method over periods of and years 
these acquisitions did not have a significant effect upon reported earnings for results of operations  year ended december  vs

results in included the operations of non strategic businesses divested in the third quarter of excluding the revenues of the divested businesses in  which totaled million  revenues in increased 
operating profit margins from continuing operations were in compared to in operating results of the non strategic businesses did not have a material impact on operating margins in information technology services segment revenues  which represented of the company s consolidated revenues  grew over the prior year 
prior to  the company s information technology services business was operationally integrated with  and served the same customer base as technical services 
while continuing to grow  the information technology services growth rate slowed in as its manufacturing oriented customer base experienced a slow down in business during the year 
to facilitate development of a distinct business strategy and to better serve its customers  during the second and third quarters of the company created a discrete operating unit for information technology services to focus on a more diverse customer base to include new it intensive industries and to increase sales of its value added project and functional outsourcing

results in included the operations of non strategic businesses divested in the third quarter of excluding the revenues of the divested businesses in  revenues in increased 
beginning in late and continuing throughout  many of technical services customers experienced difficult business conditions due to factors ranging from turbulent international market conditions to delayed new product introductions and inventory imbalances 
demand from electronics and hydrocarbon petrochemical customers in particular was down in  partially offset by growth in automotive  construction and industrial equipment 
operating profit margins for technical services were in compared to in entering  the company s support structure related to technical staffing reflected anticipated growth in demand for services in when increased demand did not materialize in the first quarter  the company took steps to realign the technical staffing support structure 
these steps included downsizing the technical services overhead structure

the remaining  in non recurring charges related to healthcare costs associated with a self insured medical program  which has been replaced with an indemnity program  and vacation pay costs resulting from the implementation of a new compensation program 
substantially all of the reorganization and non recurring costs were paid during technical services operating profit in included a net gain of million from the divestiture of non strategic businesses in the third quarter  management recruiters segment revenues  which in represented of the company s consolidated revenues  grew over the prior year in response to continued strong demand for middle management search and recruiting services including large scale permanent placement assignments with certain customers

at the end of  after investigating strategic alternatives for the automotive developmental engineering division of a subsidiary  the company adopted a plan to dispose of that division 
during  the company attempted to sell the division but was unsuccessful due to deteriorating market conditions 
as a consequence  the company undertook to liquidate the division by winding down contracts with customers and disposing of assets 
in the fourth quarter of  an addition to the loss reserve for discontinued operations of million million after taxes was recorded 
this adjustment primarily reflected a full reserve for a disputed receivable related to a major automotive developmental engineering contract on which work was terminated in late additional reserves were also provided for operating losses through the final wind down of the business 
in the fourth quarter of  a gain of million million after taxes related to discontinued operations was recorded reflecting lower than anticipated costs related to the wind down of the discontinued operations and greater realization in disposal of assets than expected 
interest expense was million in compared to million in reflecting lower levels of debt outstanding 
full year results reflect a credit of million  recorded in the third quarter of  from the reduction of income tax reserves no longer required 
during the year ended december   the company made a number of acquisitions in which it invested  the acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method 
goodwill acquired amounted to  and is being amortized on the straight line method over and years 
these acquisitions did not have a significant effect upon reported earnings for year the company s year yk inventory  assessment and solutions implementations programs leading up to the year  appear to have been largely successful 
the company entered the year substantially fully yk compliant  and there have been no meaningful interruptions of services within the company or with its external constituencies 
however  inasmuch as only a few months have gone by in the year  albeit potentially the most revealing ones  there can still be no assurance that there will be no material impact as a result of yk issues  particularly considering the dependence and interdependence that exists with third parties 
the cost of the company s yk program was approximately million  all of which was charged against operations 
of this amount  approximately million was incurred in and the balance in the costs of yk compliance do not include costs associated with new financial systems or new personnel recruiting and human resource systems 
these systems already were scheduled for implementation and their implementation was not accelerated because of year issues 
inflation the technical services  information technology services and todays staffing segments services are priced generally in close relationship with direct labor costs 
management recruiters middle management search services are priced as a function of salary levels of job candidates 
in recent years inflation has not been a meaningful factor 
liquidity and capital resources expansions and contractions in the levels at which the company s businesses operate directly affect consolidated working capital  which in turn has a direct relationship to total capital employed because of the high concentration of total assets represented by current assets 
working capital  associated with continuing operations  increased in because of an increase in the collection cycle for accounts receivable and an increase in the levels of business at which the company was operating 
this level of business activity includes increased billings to customers for subcontract labor for which the company does not reflect revenues 
however  such billings are included in accounts receivable 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  to and to  as of december   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to total capital long term debt plus shareholders equity as of december  and was and  respectively 
the company had no long term debt as of december  in august  the company initiated a program to repurchase up to of its outstanding shares of common stock over a one year period 
through december    shares were purchased under the program 
aggregate cost for the shares repurchased was  no shares were purchased in the company s main sources of liquidity have been from operations and from borrowings  including a revolving credit agreement and short term lines of credit with banks 
the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to million 
since the revolving credit agreement and short term lines of credit are all priced at floating rates of interest  the company is subject to market risks as interest rates change 
considering the most restrictive of the limitations placed on bank borrowings by the agreements at december   the company had borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement of an additional million 
these sources have been adequate to support growth opportunities in the company s businesses 
the company does not have any off balance sheet financial instruments or derivatives 
current assets represent a high portion of consolidated total assets and are an important source of liquidity 
this source could be tapped voluntarily by reducing the volume of business accepted  thereby turning a portion of working capital into cash 
similarly  when the company s business levels contract  such as during periods of economic decline  a portion of working capital is turned into cash 
the company believes that the public and private debt and equity markets would be currently available as sources of additional capital 
new accounting standards in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and is effective for years beginning after june  the company will determine the extent to which statement no 
applies and adopt the standards established as required 
currently the company has no derivatives or hedging activities
