the company s products and services are marketed in states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be counter cyclical to each other 
demand for the company s products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting the company s customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy

the company s strategy in the past focused on addressing current trends in the industrial distribution market through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth 
due to current conditions in the industry  the company has curtailed its acquisitions efforts
