 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedge activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement  as amended  is effective for the fiscal quarters of the company s fiscal year ending december  the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of this statement on its financial statements 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  working capital at that date was  versus  at december  resulting primarily from the refinancing of  of current liabilities with long term debt under the company s new million credit facility and an increase in receivables and inventory of  the company manages its cash balances to minimize interest expense on its line of credit borrowing 
at december   the company had million available under its revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   the company generated  in cash from operations after financing its working capital requirements  primarily an increase in accounts receivable and inventories related to increased sales volume  including acquired products 
management anticipates additional investment in working capital to finance continued sales growth  but has active working capital management initiatives in place to reduce receivables and inventory levels 
investing activities  which include the purchase of product related intangible assets as well as equipment required  in cash 
purchases of equipment for the manufacture of lyophilized freeze dried pharmaceuticals accounted for  of the  cash used in investing activities and the company expects to incur an additional  for such purchases during financing activities provided  in cash primarily through a net  increase in long term debt and  from stock option exercises 
the company s repayment of capital lease obligations used  in cash 
capital expenditures for equipment in and principally relate to the company s lyophilization project as discussed in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
in the company entered into a million revolving credit arrangement  increased to million in  and subsequently increased to million in  subject to certain financial covenants 
see note h to consolidated financial statement for a description of this indebtedness and other indebtedness of the company 
management believes that cash flow from operations  in conjunction with borrowing availability under its credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the cash needs of the business for the foreseeable future  but additional long term financing may be needed to finance product development or acquisitions 
there are no guarantees that such financing will be available or available at an acceptable cost 
year issues the company established a process to identify and resolve the business issues associated with year and expended resources to ensure that its critical processes were year compliant 
the company did not experience any business disruptions associated with year the company will continue to monitor its computer applications throughout year to ensure that any latent year matters are addressed promptly

the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of the company s products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the food and drug administration fda  the drug enforcement agency dea  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration osha and the us environmental protection agency epa 
these activities are also regulated by similar state and local agencies 
failure to comply with applicable statutes and government regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including the company  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
those powers include  but are not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp  to recall products which present a health risk  and to seek civil monetary and criminal penalties 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products marketed by the company or the halting of manufacturing operations of the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at the discretion of the company  the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical product sales 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that recalls of the company s pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
all new drugs must be the subject of an fda approved new drug application nda before they may be marketed in the united states 
certain prescription drugs are not currently required to be the subject of an approved nda but  rather  may be marketed pursuant to an fda regulatory enforcement policy permitting continued marketing of those drugs until the fda determines whether they are safe and effective 
all generic equivalents to previously approved drugs or new dosage forms of existing drugs must be the subject of an fda approved abbreviated new drug application anda before they may be marketed in the united states 
the fda has the authority to withdraw existing nda and anda approvals and to review the regulatory status of products marketed under the enforcement policy 
the fda may require an approved nda or anda for any drug product marketed under the enforcement policy if new information reveals questions about the drug s safety or effectiveness 
all drugs must be manufactured in conformity with cgmp and drugs subject to an approved nda or anda must be manufactured  processed  packaged  held  and labeled in accordance with information contained in the nda or anda 
the company and its third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure such compliance 
the fda imposes additional stringent requirements on the manufacture of sterile pharmaceutical products to ensure the sterilization processes and related control procedures consistently produce a sterile product 
additional sterile manufacturing requirements include the submission for expert review of detailed documentation for sterilization process validation in drug applications beyond those required for general manufacturing process validation 
various sterilization process requirements are the subject of detailed fda guidelines  including requirements for the maintenance of microbiological control and quality stability 
pharmaceutical products must be distributed  sampled and promoted in accordance with fda requirements 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
the company believes its operating facilities and practices are in compliance with applicable federal and state law 
however  a finding by a governmental agency or court that the company is not in compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
while the company believes that all of its current pharmaceuticals are lawfully marketed in the united states under current fda enforcement policies or have received the requisite agency approvals for manufacture and sale  such marketing authority is subject to withdrawal by the fda 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for a company product not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for a company product could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of products marketed by the company are grandfathered drugs which are permitted to be manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed prior to enactment of relevant sections of the fdc act 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
the company is not aware of any current efforts by the fda to change the status of any of its grandfathered products  but there can be no assurance that such initiatives will not occur in the future 
any such change in the status of the company s grandfathered products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also manufactures and sells drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which establishes  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which the company is permitted to manufacture and market 
the company has not experienced sanctions or fines for non compliance with the foregoing regulations  but no assurance can be given that any such sanctions or fines would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or statutes or legal interpretation  when and if promulgated or enacted  may have on its business in the future 
changes could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on development of pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities the company s strategy for growth is dependent upon its ability to develop products that can be promoted through existing marketing and distribution channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
the company currently has andas in various stages of development and anticipates filing four ndas 
see item description of business research and development 
the company may not meet its anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that it has submitted or anticipates submitting 
the internal development of new pharmaceutical products by the company is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of the company s personnel and its infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into its existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will receive all necessary approvals from the fda or that such approvals will not involve delays which adversely affect the marketing and sale of the company s products 
the company s failure to develop new products or receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
another part of the company s growth strategy is to develop the capability to manufacture lyophilized freeze dried pharmaceutical products 
while the company has devoted resources to developing these capabilities  it may not be successful in developing these capabilities  or the company may not realize the anticipated benefits from developing these capabilities 
generic substitution the company s branded pharmaceutical products are subject to competition from generic equivalents and alternative therapies 
generic pharmaceuticals are the chemical and therapeutic equivalents of brand name pharmaceuticals and represent an increasing proportion of pharmaceuticals dispensed in the united states 
there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products sold by the company and generic and other substitutes for most of its branded pharmaceutical products are sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for the company s branded pharmaceutical products 
although the company attempts to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for its branded pharmaceutical products  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
increased competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
dependence on generic and off patent pharmaceutical products the success of the company depends  in part  on its ability to anticipate which branded pharmaceuticals are about to come off patent and thus permit the company to develop  manufacture and market equivalent generic pharmaceutical products 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices which are significantly lower than that of branded pharmaceuticals 
in addition  generic products that third parties develop may render the company s generic products noncompetitive or obsolete 
although the company has successfully brought generic pharmaceutical products to market in a timely manner in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consistently bring these products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or the company s failure to bring such products to market before its competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition  uncertainty of technological change the company competes with other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than those of the company  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than the company s current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change which may render the company s products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than the company 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of the company s products 
the company believes that competition in sales of its products is based primarily on price  service  availability and product efficacy 
there can be no assurance that i the company will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  or iii competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on supply of raw materials and components the company requires a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for itself and for third parties with which it has contracted 
the principal components of the company s products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials 
many of these components are available from only a single source and  in many of the company s andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay the company s development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package its products  it may not be able to manufacture its products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party manufacturers the company derives a significant portion of its net sales from the sale of products manufactured by third parties  including its competitors in some instances 
there can be no assurance that the company s dependence on third parties for the manufacture of such products will not adversely affect the company s profit margins or its ability to develop and deliver its products on a timely and competitive basis 
if for any reason the company is unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  it may not be able to distribute certain of its products as planned 
no assurance can be made that the manufacturers utilized by the company will be able to provide the company with sufficient quantities of its products or that the products supplied to the company will meet the company s specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability the company faces exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its technologies or products or those it licenses from third parties is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects in users thereof 
receipt of regulatory approval for commercial sale of such products does not mitigate such product liability risks 
while the company has taken  and will continue to take  what it believes are appropriate precautions  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant product liability exposure 
in addition  future product labeling may include disclosure of additional adverse effects  precautions and contraindications  which may adversely impact sales of such products 
the company currently has product liability insurance in the amount of million for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that its insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover fully potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical products as part of its growth strategy  the company plans to purchase or license pharmaceutical product lines of other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources  compete with the company for the right to acquire or license such products 
the company s success in executing this strategy depends  in part  on its ability to identify potential products that meet the company s criteria  including possessing a recognizable brand name or being complementary to the company s existing product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company will have success in identifying potential product acquisitions or licensing opportunities or that  if identified  it will complete such product acquisitions or obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or that it will successfully integrate any acquired or licensed products into its existing product lines 
the inability to complete acquisitions of  or obtain licenses for  pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company  once it has obtained rights to a pharmaceutical product and committed to payment terms  will be able to generate sales sufficient to create a profit or otherwise avoid a loss 
any inability to generate such sufficient sales or any subsequent reduction of sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
patents and proprietary rights the patent position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications relating to the company s potential products or processes will result in patents being issued  or that the resulting patents  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge the company s patents  ii obtain patents that may have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent the company s patent position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by the company  which could prevent the company from obtaining patent protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed therefrom 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or obsoleting those that the company is planning to develop  or duplicate any of the company s products 
the inability of the company to obtain patents for its products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete the company s patents could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need to attract and retain key personnel in highly competitive marketplace the company s performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of its key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and its ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
the company is facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key executive officers the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to retain its key executive officers 
the loss of one or more of the company s key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly fluctuation of results  possible volatility of stock price the company s results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for company products  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in the company s customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by the company s competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by the company  changes in sales and marketing expenditures and competitive pricing pressures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedge activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement  as amended  is effective for the fiscal quarters of the company s fiscal year ending december  the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of this statement on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
the company s interest rate exposure is limited to interest rate changes on its revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement bears interest at rates which fluctuate at the federal funds rate or libor plus an applicable percentage  depending upon certain financial ratios 
all of the company s remaining long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
the company believes that reasonable possibly near term changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s financial instruments consist mainly of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
the carrying amount of these instruments  except debt  approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
the estimated fair value of the company s debt instruments is based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities
