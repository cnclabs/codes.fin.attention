net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses was due to a increase in our average loans  which was offset by a decrease in our average yield on loans to in from in  primarily due to the continuation of lower interest rates in the market during the first half of  as well as our acquisition of fewer discounted loans 
the decrease in the average yield on loans was offset by a reduction in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities to in from in  as we experienced significant decreases in our costs for deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings 
average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities both increased in fiscal year as compared to the prior year

provision for loan and valuation losses 
the provision for loan and valuation losses decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to the million pre tax provision recorded in  related to mca mortgage  but was offset by increases made to the provision due to the increase in the balance of net loans receivable  which increased to billion at december  as compared to million at december  and our origination of additional non residential mortgage loans

loan administration 
loan administration income represents service fees earned from servicing loans for various investors  which are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance plus late fees and other ancillary charges 
loan administration fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loan administration fees are affected by factors that include the size of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio  the servicing spread  the timing of payment collections and the amount of ancillary fees received 
the mortgage loan servicing portfolio increased to an average balance of billion for fiscal year as compared to an average balance of billion for fiscal year our average service fee rates including all ancillary income were comparable during the two years with for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year brokerage fees 
brokerage fees represent income earned from brokerage and consulting services performed pertaining to mortgage servicing rights 
brokerage fees decreased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease is the result of a decrease in the balance of residential mortgage servicing portfolios brokered by united financial  which in terms of aggregate unpaid principal balances on the underlying loans  decreased billion to billion for fiscal year as compared to billion for fiscal year the decrease is attributable to a slow down in the market for the purchase and sale of mortgage servicing rights  which was seen primarily in the last quarter of we believe the lower trading volumes were due in part to year concerns 
due to current market conditions for mortgage servicing rights  we are unable to predict whether united financial will  in the foreseeable future  broker the volume of mortgage servicing rights that it did during fiscal year in addition  brokerage fees vary from quarter to quarter as the timing of servicing sales is dependent upon the seller s need to recognize a sale or to receive cash flows 
trust services 
trust service fees increased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase is associated with the growth in total assets under administration to over billion at december  from billion at december   primarily as a result of increased mutual fund values at year end the number of trust accounts remained fairly constant with  accounts at december  and  accounts at december  much of the growth can be attributed to the settlement and clearing services which we have focused on in asset disposition services 
asset disposition service income represents fees earned by united special services for real estate management and disposition services provided on foreclosed properties owned by financial services companies and financial institutions 
asset disposition service income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year gain on sale of loans 
during fiscal years and  we made bulk loan sales of approximately million and million  for gains on sale of bulk mortgage loans of million and million  respectively 
these loan sales were completed under standard purchase and sale agreements  with standard representations and warranties and without recourse 
the gains from these sales represent cash gains 
gain on sale of loans can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  such as the current interest rate environment  the supply and mix of loan portfolios available in the market  the type of loan portfolios we purchase and the particular loan portfolios we elect to sell 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights 
gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights decreased  or  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year in terms of aggregate outstanding principal balances of mortgage loans underlying such mortgage servicing rights  we sold million in purchased mortgage servicing rights during fiscal year as compared to million during fiscal year gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the market value of our servicing portfolio  the particular servicing portfolios we elect to sell and the availability of similar portfolios in the market 
due to our position in and knowledge of the market  we will at times pursue opportunistic sales of mortgage servicing rights 
loan origination 
loan origination income includes all mortage loan fees  secondary marketing activity on new loan originations and servicing release premiums on new originations sold  net of origination costs 
loan origination income increased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year approximately  of this increase related to loans originated and sold by matrix bank s small business administration loan department 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from differences in the pricing and mix of loans originated  which offset the million decrease in wholesale residential mortgage loan production 
we originated million of wholesale residential mortgage loans in as compared to million in we attribute the decrease in wholesale originations primarily to the effects of rising interest rates in the last half of other income 
other income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in other income was primarily due to 
an increase in school services income earned by abs of million  and 
certain of our financing transactions which increased miscellaneous fee income approximately million over the prior fiscal year 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to our overall growth and expansion  including the acquisition of abs  and an increase in the amortization of mortgage servicing rights

additionally  expansions in the operations of matrix financial  matrix bank and sterling trust also increased compensation expense 
we had an overall increase of employees  or  to employees at december  as compared to employees at december   of which were at abs 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year amortization of mortgage servicing rights fluctuates based on the size of our mortgage servicing portfolio and the prepayment rates experienced 
our prepayment rates on our servicing portfolio averaged during fiscal year as compared to during fiscal year in response to the lower interest rates prevalent in the market during the first half of  prepayment speeds remained high due to borrowers refinancing into lower interest rate mortgages 
however  we have seen significant decreases in our prepayment speeds in the latter half of  which we anticipate to continue due to the higher interest rates prevalent in the market as compared to the majority of s interest rate environment 
the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication expense  professional fees  data processing costs and other expenses  increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was generally attributable to increased legal expenses and increased servicing costs associated with the nonperforming federal housing administration veteran s administration loans that were transferred to us in september see legal proceedings and asset and liability management nonperforming assets 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was a result of our increased pre tax income  as well as a slight increase in the effective tax rate to for fiscal year from for fiscal year comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and net income  return on average equity

excluding non recurring charges  earnings per share increased to in from in  or  and returns on average equity were for fiscal year and for fiscal year during recent years  matrix financial entered into several purchase transactions with mca mortgage corporation  a michigan based mortgage banking entity 
at december   matrix financial was carrying approximately million of residential mortgage loans on its balance sheet that were purchased from mca mortgage on a servicing retained basis 
we also had an outstanding receivable relating to brokerage and consulting services provided to mca mortgage 
in january  we learned that mca mortgage was closing its operations 
additionally  in february  we learned that mca mortgage had declared bankruptcy and that some of the loans purchased by matrix financial had been sold multiple times or pledged multiple times as security for repayment of various credit facilities 
we also discovered that there appeared to be servicing issues relating to some of the purchased loans 
the servicing issues consisted of instances in which loans owned by matrix financial and serviced by mca mortgage had previously paid off  but for which mca mortgage had continued to remit monthly principal and interest  rather than the payoff proceeds 
as a result of the above mca mortgage issues  we recorded a pre tax loss as of december  of approximately million 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses was due to a increase in our average loan balance  which was offset by a decrease in our net interest margin to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the average yield on loans decreased to in from in  primarily due to the overall decrease and continuance of lower interest rates in the market  as well as our acquisition of fewer discounted loans

a significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  we strive to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what we believe to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of our performance due to changes in interest rates 
we constantly attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
we have responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include 
utilizing mortgage servicing rights as a source of noninterest income and as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising interest rate environment 
increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans  
increasing the noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to our mortgage servicing rights  
increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services  real estate disposition and school business services  
maintaining a wholesale loan origination operation 
wholesale originations provide a form of hedge against the balance of mortgage servicing rights 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments of the underlying loans 
during this same environment  however  the volume of loan originations generally increases  
originating and purchasing adjustable rate mortgages and selling newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages in the secondary market  
increasing emphasis on the origination of construction and commercial real estate lending  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  
increasing retail deposits  which are less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other funding sources  
pursuing strategic acquisitions or alliances that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund our investing activities  
using matrix bank as the settlement bank for settlement and clearing services offered by sterling trust and matrix settlement clearance services to generate low cost deposits  and 
hedging segments of our servicing portfolio and selling forward commitments on our loan pipeline 
lending activities 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities

loans held for sale are classified as maturing over three years  except for direct financing leases which are classified as maturing within one year 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments or the timing of loan sales

the terms of these agreements vary with each seller but include provisions which require the seller to repurchase the loans within a defined period of time  or provide at our option  the ability  on short notice  to require the seller to repurchase the loans  or in some cases  allow the seller to repurchase the loans 
in all cases  the seller provides us contractual recourse in the event of delinquency and or loss 
loans held for investment  which are contractually due in one or more years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  one to five over five years years total in thousands fixed    adjustable    total loans    nonperforming assets 
as part of asset and liability management  we monitor nonperforming assets on a monthly basis 
nonperforming assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual mortgage loans      nonaccrual commercial loans and direct financing leases   nonaccrual consumer loans total nonperforming loans and leases      foreclosed real estate  repossessed automobiles total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for loan and valuation losses to total nonperforming loans and leases interest income on nonperforming loans and leases not included in interest income as of december   we had approximately million of non government accruing loans and leases that were contractually past due days or more 
we accrue for interest on government sponsored loans such as federal housing administration insured and veterans administration guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
nonaccrual mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   at december   at december  at december  and at december  the increase in can be primarily attributed to a sub prime residential portfolio that we acquired on a scheduled interest and scheduled principal remittance with full recourse to the seller servicer 
in october  however  the seller servicer declared bankruptcy and the servicing was transferred to us 
the total principal balance of the portfolio was million at december   and approximately million was or more days delinquent at that time 
we believe that a portion of these delinquencies are a result of the servicing transfer 
associated with these loans  we have a  reserve  which is not reflected in the general valuation reserve 
see legal proceedings 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans and direct financing leases in and is the result of our origination of tax exempt lease financing for charter schools for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
several of the charter schools for which we have provided financing have encountered enrollment and or state funding delays  which has caused them to become delinquent on their lease obligations to us 
the increase in the nonaccrual consumer loans in is a result of sub prime auto loans that we repurchased pursuant to limited representations and warranties included in loan sale agreements 
we had a separate reserve of  included in other liabilities for anticipated losses relating to the repurchased sub prime auto loans at december  included in repossessed assets for is  of automobiles that we were required to repurchase pursuant to the same limited representations and warranties 
the balance of the loans and automobiles repurchased in and were either disposed of or sold to a third party investor in december we do not anticipate that we will originate any additional sub prime automobile contracts 
the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
we generally purchase such loans at discounts and  in some instances  receive recourse or credit enhancement from the seller to further reduce our risk of loss associated with the loans nonaccrual status 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were million  of which million  or  were nonaccrual loans 
the percentage of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to nonaccrual loans varies widely due to the nature of our portfolio of mortgage loans  which are collateralized primarily by residential real estate 
we analyze the collateral for each nonperforming mortgage loan to determine potential loss exposure 
in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and valuation losses

credit card loans accounted for and of our total loan portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the majority of our credit card portfolio was originated in and the balance of our unsecured credit card portfolio at december  was million 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is increased by the provision for loan and valuation losses which is charged to operations for particular loans where management considers ultimate collection to be questionable 
we evaluate all other loans as part of their respective categories and not on an individual basis 
each category of loans in the loan portfolio is assigned a loss factor based on 
the assessed risk inherent in each loan category  
certain qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  
trends in the portfolio  
geographic and portfolio concentrations  
new products or markets  and 
evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component and projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions 
these loss factors range from for federal housing administration veterans administration loans guaranteed by the department of housing and urban development to for credit card loans 
additionally substandard and doubtful loans of homogeneous loan portfolios are assigned loss factors of and  respectively 
we had no impaired loans as december     and the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balance of loans in their respective categories  and the total for all categories determines our allowance for loan and valuation losses  except for direct financing leases  for which the allowance is determined based on specific leases

the allowance for loan and valuation losses allocated to residential  multi family  commercial real estate  commercial and construction loans has increased mainly due to the increased outstanding loan principal balances in these loan categories and not due to any increase in the perceived risk or losses experienced in these categories 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb the inherent losses in the current loan portfolio 
we did not assign any of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to direct financing leases in  as we originated the million of outstanding direct financing leases in the last month of the year and we felt that it was not necessary due to the immaterial amount of leases relative to the total loan portfolio 
the increase in the allowance for loan and valuation losses in and reflects the growth of the direct financing leases during and and the nonaccrual status of a portion of this portfolio at december  and  as well as increases in the size of the residential loan portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of our earnings and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  mortgage servicing rights  and also related to its loan origination volumes  as well as the net interest income earned on its originated loans that are funded through warehouse lines of credit 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster which reduces future servicing income  while in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
as it relates to matrix financial s lending activities  matrix financial originates residential mortgage loans  which are generally pre sold 
however  between the time that the loan is originated and sold to the ultimate investor  matrix financial earns interest income 
the loans are funded through the use of warehouse credit facilities that are generally priced based on short term interest rates 
therefore  the net interest income that is earned by matrix financial is generally dependent on the spread between long term mortgage rates and short term interest rates 
additionally  rising interest rate environments typically decrease loan origination volumes  whereas falling interest rate environments typically increase loan origination volumes 
we currently do not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  we are not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio is held for sale which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
the asset and liability committee establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the asset and liability committee is also involved in formulating our budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
due to the historical size of matrix bank s loan portfolio and the high degree of purchase and sale activity  the asset and liability committee has relied on the office of thrift supervision interest rate risk exposure report to assist in the overall monitoring of matrix bank s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the information and assumptions used in the office of thrift supervision exposure report as of december   a downward basis point shock over a twelve month period would increase matrix bank s capital by approximately  and an upward basis point shock over a twelve month period would decrease matrix bank s capital by approximately  which  however  leaves matrix bank with a capital balance that still exceeds its current capital balance at december  by approximately million 
as matrix bank grew to in excess of billion in total assets in  we can no longer rely on the office of thrift supervision reports to manage our interest rate risk 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services that will assist us with asset liability management 
we are also researching various asset liability software packages for possible future acquisition by matrix bank 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and have increased our efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  commercial real estate loans and limited consumer lending  which re price or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
in  we increased our investment in nonperforming federal housing administration and veteran s administration loans  which are fixed rate loans that have a significantly shorter life than newly originated loans 
the other significant asset that we invest in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from residential mortgage servicing rights respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease  in turn decreasing net interest income  the value of the mortgage servicing rights increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
another significant strategy that we focus on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in mortgage servicing rights  which generate no cost escrow deposits and sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs 
in the ordinary course of business  we make commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and hold originated loans until delivery to an investor 
inherent in this business are risks associated with changes in interest rates and the resulting change in the market value of the pipeline loans 
we mitigate this risk through the use of mandatory and nonmandatory forward commitments to sell loans 
as of december   we had million in pipeline and funded loans offset with mandatory forward commitments of million and nonmandatory forward commitments of million 
the inherent value of the forward commitments is considered in the determination of the lower of cost or market for such loans 
ownership of mortgage servicing rights exposes us to impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of our mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than we projected for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  we hedged a segment of our portfolio beginning in september we had identified and hedged million as of december  and million as of december  of our mortgage servicing portfolio using a program of exchange traded futures and options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the following tables represent  in tabular form  contractual balances of our on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair value of those on balance sheet financial instruments for the periods ended december  and the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as interest earning deposits  federal home loan bank stock and certain other deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we are very active in the secondary market as it relates to the purchase and sale of mortgage loans 
in the past  we have made the assumption that the entire portfolio of loans held for sale will mature in the first year  as the total amount of loans sold generally represent a significant portion of our held for sale portfolio 
in the past year  loans sold as a percentage of the held for sale portfolio has decreased as we are growing matrix bank s assets 
the total amount of loans sold by matrix bank in and approximated and  respectively  of matrix bank s total held for sale portfolio at december  and this proves our intent to sell the loans classified as held for sale  but no longer supports our one year maturity assumption 
we will now use a three year maturity assumption for matrix bank s held for sale loans and a one year maturity assumption will still be used for matrix financial s originated loans held for sale and all direct financing leases 
we also treat the federal home loan bank and revolving borrowings as long term in nature  as the continued availability of these amounts is anticipated indefinitely 
third party servicers service a portion of our loan portfolio  as a result  a portion of the information presented is based on the best available information 
for the most part  the carrying amounts of interest earning deposits  federal home loan bank stock  federal home loan bank borrowings and borrowed money approximate those assets and liabilities fair values 
the fair values of the loan portfolios for held for sale and held for investment are based on quoted market prices or outstanding commitments from investors 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in securitization transactions  adjusted for differences in loan characteristics 
the fair values of forward sale commitments are included in the determination of the fair value of loans held for sale 
the fair values of demand deposits are  by definition  equal to the amount payable upon demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected periodic maturities on time deposits 
mortgage servicing rights are not included in the tabular presentation  as the investment does not directly affect interest income 
as noted  however  earnings from mortgage servicing rights directly correlate with market risk as it relates to interest rate fluctuations 
we mitigate this risk through both the type of mortgage servicing rights acquired and hedging of mortgage servicing rights 
the loans underlying the servicing rights acquired tend to be more seasoned and have lower principal balances 
management believes that the more seasoned  lower balance servicing portfolios carry less prepayment risk than less seasoned  higher balance mortgage servicing  because the cost savings of refinancing a lower balance loan tend to be less than for a higher balance loan with a comparable interest rate 
we also believe that if a loan has been outstanding for a period of time and has been through several declining interest rate cycles without refinancing  the risk of prepayment in the future is less than a newly originated loan 
although significantly increased in and  the prepayment percentages which we have experienced over the past three years have been lower than experienced in the industry  as a whole 
the prepayment speeds for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  during a primarily decreasing interest rate environment 
during the last quarter of  as interest rates began to increase  our prepayment speeds slowed significantly 
in the table below  prepayment speeds of were used for all loan types to project expected cash flows relating to loans held for investment  and in the table below  prepayment speeds of and were used for residential and non residential loans  respectively 
these assumptions are based on our historical prepayment speeds  as well as our knowledge and experience in the market

short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we rely heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the federal home loan bank for matrix bank and unaffiliated financial institutions for matrix financial 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table sets forth a summary of our short term borrowings during  and and as of the end of each such period average weighted weighted amount amount maximum average average outstanding outstanding outstanding interest interest at during the at any rate during rate at year end year month end the year year end dollars in thousands at or for the year ended december  federal home loan bank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements    lease financing    at or for the year ended december  federal home loan bank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements    lease financing    at or for the year ended december  federal home loan bank borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements   calculations are based on daily averages where available and monthly averages otherwise 
a total of million of the federal home loan bank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under a short option advance agreement with the federal home loan bank 
these short option advance borrowings have a term of ten years  but are callable by the federal home loan bank beginning after a six month or one year lock out period depending on the particular short option advance borrowing 
after the expiration of the lock out period  the short option advance borrowings are callable at three month intervals 
if the federal home loan bank exercises its call option on a short option advance borrowing  the federal home loan bank is required to offer replacement funding to us at a market rate of interest for the remaining term of the short option advance borrowing 
the interest rates on the short option advance borrowings ranged from to at december  and their possible call dates varied from january  to december  under the terms of the short option advance agreement  we are not permitted to prepay or otherwise retire a callable short option advance borrowing prior to the final maturity date 
additionally  million of the federal home loan bank borrowings outstanding at december  are fixed term rate advances  which were borrowed from the federal home loan bank to offset specific loans originated by matrix bank 
the principal amount of these fixed term rate advances adjust monthly based on an amortization schedule 
the interest rate on the fixed term rate advances was and their maturity date is june  a total of million of the federal home loan bank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under a short option advance agreement with the federal home loan bank

to date  our principal source of funding for our investing activities has been 
secured senior debt provided by unaffiliated financial institutions  
the issuance of preferred securities through matrix bancorp capital trust i in july  
the issuance of senior notes in september  
the issuance of senior subordinated notes in august  
a bank stock loan  and 
our initial public offering 
as of december   matrix bancorp had million in indebtedness outstanding 
the borrowed funds have been used historically as capital injections to matrix bank  matrix financial and abs  as well as to acquire the office building in phoenix where matrix financial maintains its headquarters 
see properties 
on july   matrix bancorp capital trust i  a delaware business trust formed by matrix bancorp  completed the sale of million of preferred securities 
matrix bancorp capital trust i also issued common securities to matrix bancorp and used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures of matrix bancorp due september  the junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of matrix bancorp capital trust i and are eliminated  along with the related income statement effects  in the consolidated financial statements 
we used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures to redeem our outstanding senior subordinated notes due july   to make contributions to matrix bank  matrix financial and abs to fund their respective operations  to redeem other higher interest rate indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
total expenses associated with the offering of approximately million are included in other assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the junior subordinated debentures 
the preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly at an annual rate of of the stated liquidation amount of per preferred security 
we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of matrix bancorp capital trust i under the preferred securities 
the guarantee covers the quarterly distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the preferred securities  but only to the extent of funds held by matrix bancorp capital trust i 
the preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the junior subordinated debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture 
we have the right to redeem the junior subordinated debentures  in whole or in part on or after september   at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
under the indenture  we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the scheduled payments on our junior debentures and trust preferred securities have not been made 
on june   we amended our bank stock loan agreement 
the amended bank stock loan agreement has two components  a million term loan and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the term loan was million and the balance of the revolving line of credit was million 
the amended bank stock loan requires us to maintain 
total shareholders equity of the greater of million or of actual net worth at the end of the most recent fiscal year  plus of cumulative net income after the end of the most recent fiscal year  plus of all contributions made to stockholders equity after the closing date  and 
total adjusted debt to net worth less than additionally  the amended bank stock loan does not permit matrix bancorp to declare or pay any cash dividends 
on september   we completed a registered debt offering of million in senior notes due  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
interest on the senior notes of is payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commenced on march   with a balloon payment for the entire principal balance due in september the senior notes require us to 
maintain consolidated tangible equity capital of not less than million  and 
meet the requirements necessary such that matrix bank will not be classified as other than well capitalized as defined by applicable regulatory guidelines 
additionally  the senior notes contain other covenants regarding certain restricted payments  incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock  liens  merger  consolidation or sale of assets and transactions with affiliates 
under the conditions of the senior notes  we may not incur any additional indebtedness if the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds  and we may not declare or pay cash dividends unless at the time of and after giving effect to such dividend 
no default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof  
after giving effect to the payment of such dividend  we would be permitted to incur at least of additional indebtedness pursuant to the consolidated leverage ratio described above  and 
such dividend  together with the aggregate amount of all restricted payments made  is less than of our aggregate consolidated net income for the period beginning on october  and ending on the date of our most recent quarter plus of the net cash proceeds we received from the issuance of equity interests 
as of december   under the foregoing test  we would be entitled to declare and pay dividends of approximately  although we have no present intent to do so  as distributions are not permitted under our bank stock loan 
in august  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
interest on the senior subordinated notes was payable semi annually on january and july  and the senior subordinated notes were to mature on july  until february  the senior subordinated notes bore interest at per annum 
in february  the annual rate increased to per annum 
in july  matrix bancorp made the first of four scheduled mandatory redemptions of  or of the senior subordinated notes 
we were entitled to redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july  at a redemption price equal to par  plus all accrued but unpaid interest 
in september  we redeemed the remaining balance of million at par plus accrued interest 
the trend of net cash used by our operating activities experienced over the reported periods results primarily from the growth that matrix bank has experienced in its residential loan purchasing activity 
we anticipate the trend of a net use of cash from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
this anticipation results from the expected continued growth at matrix bank  which we believe will consist primarily of increased activity in the purchasing of loan and mortgage servicing portfolios 
however  due to liquidity and capital availability  we do not anticipate growth to be as significant as in prior periods 
matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are 
retail deposits  
trust deposits  
custodial escrow balances  
brokered deposits  
federal home loan bank borrowings  
sales of loan portfolios and mortgage servicing rights  and 
proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
contractual loan payments and net deposit inflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the federal home loan bank as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had borrowings from the federal home loan bank of million 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance  as well as the level of prepayments which occur

matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s retail deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits are obtained primarily from areas in which it is located and  therefore  its retail deposits are concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits 
beginning in february  brokered deposits were accepted and have been utilized to support growth at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities 
in february  sterling trust moved approximately million of fiduciary deposits from a third party institution to matrix bank

matrix bank s future growth is expected to be achieved through deposit growth  brokered deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank and custodial deposits from affiliates 
we anticipate that such growth will require additional capital 
the capital requirements related to the anticipated growth will in part be fulfilled through retention of earnings  potentially increasing our bank stock loan and future possible debt or equity offerings
