year the year issue yk is a problem that relates to the way that computers store  manipulate  and interpret dates that define the year using only two digits and perform leap year calculations 
these systems may have experienced problems handling dates beyond and therefore  could cause computer or other systems to fail or provide erroneous results 
if a system or application will not recognize the year as a leap year  then any date after february  will be offset by one day 
date information can exist at any level of hardware or software from micro code to application programs  in files and databases  and might be present on any operating platform 
the company addressed this issue by implementing a program to assess  remediate and mitigate the potential impact of the yk problem 
the company systematically addressed the yk compliance of its computer related hardware  major application software programs  externally supplied software  and major debt sources  vendors and customers 
these efforts are generally described in the q report for the quarter ended september  as of october  the company has not experienced any yk related problems which have impacted operations and is not aware that any of its major debt sources  customers or vendors have experienced significant yk related problems 
however  yk compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
therefore  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that we will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not yk compliant
