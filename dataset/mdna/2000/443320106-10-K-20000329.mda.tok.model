year year refers to the issue surrounding the compatibility of computer and other technology based systems with dates beyond december  this section will include an assessment of the company s state of readiness  the risks the issues represent  the subsequent results of system assessments after december  and the costs to address the issues 
state of readiness management has broken down its year program into four phases 
those phases are awareness  assessment  renovation and validation 
the company contracted with an outside consulting firm to perform a readiness review  which was completed in december this review was instrumental in identifying and addressing year issues 
management believes that it has identified the risk areas facing the company regarding year and had broken those areas into seven categories 
the seven categories are i the company s main operating system that has been created and enhanced in house  ii the company s ancillary operating software applications which were purchased  iii desktop hardware and software applications  iv the company s financial reporting system  v the company s telephone systems  vi embedded technology in the company s office equipment  physical environment and drayage tractors and vii the state of readiness of the company s customers  transportation service providers and other vendors

the company has spent approximately million in total related to year the company does not expect to continue to spend additional funds related to year since no material systems problems were experienced 
business combinations divestitures management believes that future acquisitions or dispositions made by the company could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include but are not limited to revenue  net revenue  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  minority interest  net income and the company s debt level 
in this regard  on march   the company signed a letter of intent pursuant to which the company agreed to sell its interest in hub distribution for million in cash and warrants to purchase of the outstanding shares of stock of hub distribution 
the sale of this interest is subject to a number of customary conditions and there is therefore no guarantee that a transaction will ultimately be consummated 
financial results may be impacted by additional factors as discussed below 
revenue management believes that the performance of the railroads is the most significant factor that could negatively influence the company s revenue growth rate 
the service disruptions in the intermodal industry due to the split up of conrail  which began on june   appear to have been significantly rectified 
should this trend reverse  the company believes its intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should the proposed merger between burlington northern santa fe and canadian national railway cause a similar or more severe service disruption  the company believes its intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be another significant service disruption  the company expects there may be some customers who would switch from using the company s intermodal service to other carriers over the road service 
the company expects these customers may choose to continue to utilize these carriers even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence the company s growth rate include  but are not limited to  the entry of new web based competitors  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
net revenue management expects fluctuations in the net revenue percentage from quarter to quarter caused by changes in business mix  highway brokerage margins  logistics business margins  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels and accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits it is anticipated that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range are revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  such as the company s current boxcar and flatbed initiative  changes in customer requirements and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of the company s information systems and related platforms  the company believes there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
costs incurred to formulate the company s strategy as well as any costs that would be identified as reengineering or training would be expensed 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment management estimates that  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will increase in the future 
a factor that could cause an increase in the percentage is increased software amortization related to improving the company s information systems capabilities 
another factor that could cause an increase in the percentage is increased depreciation expense if the company decided to purchase rather than lease a greater proportion of assets 
amortization of goodwill management estimates that  as a percentage of revenue  amortization of goodwill will increase in based on a full year of goodwill amortization related to the april purchase 
a factor that could cause an increase in the percentage is if the company were to make additional acquisitions resulting in the recording of goodwill 
other income expense management estimates that as a percentage of revenue interest expense will increase over the prior year due to a full year of debt after financing the april purchase and the recent trend of rising interest rates 
this increase is believed to be offset by debt repayments anticipated in the year factors that could cause interest to fluctuate higher or lower than forecasted are changes in lending rates  anticipated debt repayments  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
management estimates that interest income will likely decrease from current levels 
factors that could cause such a decrease are the possible use of cash to make debt repayments  fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures 
minority interest management estimates that minority interest will likely decrease in the future due to the april purchase where all of the remaining minority interests were acquired 
disproportionate changes in hub distribution s profits and the owned entities  acquisitions of entities with a minority interest or disposition of hub distribution could have a material impact and result in minority interest percentages of income before minority interest to differ from the historical range 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that cash  cash to be provided by operations  cash available under its lines of credit and the company s ability to obtain additional credit capacity will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company uses both fixed and variable rate debt as described in note the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement designated as a hedge on a portion of the company s variable rate debt 
the purpose of the swap is to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  a weighted average pay rate of  a weighted average receive rate of and a maturity date of september  this swap agreement involves the exchange of amounts based on the variable interest rate for amounts based on the fixed interest rate over the life of the agreement  without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the debt 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile
