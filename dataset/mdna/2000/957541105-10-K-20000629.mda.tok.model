item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its telco access products tap product lines  particularly the sale of network interface units and related products 
niu products accounted for at least of revenues in fiscal years and and accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products represented approximately  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal which constituted  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
on march   the company acquired of the outstanding shares of teltrend inc  a designer  manufacturer and marketer of transmission products used by telephone companies to provide voice and data service over the telephone network 
each outstanding share of teltrend inc was converted into shares of the company s class a common stock 
total consideration included the issuance of  shares of class a common shares valued at million and million in transaction costs 
the company also assumed  options to purchase teltrend common stock and converted such options to company options to purchase approximately million shares of class a common stock  which are included in the stock option activity table illustrated in note the exercise prices of the options assumed range from to and have an average exercise price of 
the fair value of the options assumed was million and is included in the purchase price and as a component of stockholders equity in the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the options assumed was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
due to the goodwill amortization as a result of the teltrend  inc acquisition  the company expects to recognize net losses at least for the next fiscal year 
the company s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services 
they are managed separately because each business requires different technology and market strategy 
they consist of a telecommunications equipment manufacturer of local loop access products  which includes the telco access products  transport systems products and cpe products  and a multi point telecommunications service bureau  conference plus  inc  specializing in audio teleconferencing  multi point video conferencing  broadcast fax and multimedia teleconference services 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the regional bell operating companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in addition  to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and expand its sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
as a result of the significant increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses related to new product and market development  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted in fiscal  and the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities and expects to receive funding from certain partners to offset a portion of these development costs 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which is expected to adversely affect short term results of operations 
the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will principally depend on its success in increasing sales of dsl products and developing new and enhanced tap and other dsl products 
in view of the company s reliance on the emerging dsl market for growth and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenues  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from tap products such as niu s have declined in recent years as telcos continue to move to networks that deliver higher speed digital transmission services 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  equipment services total revenues cost of equipment cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative goodwill amortization restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss other income  net interest expense loss before income tax benefit benefit for income taxes net loss fiscal years ended march   and revenues

revenues increased and in fiscal and  respectively  from the preceding years 
the fiscal increase of million was primarily due to increased conference plus  inc service revenue of million  or a increase from the previous year  resulting from increased audio conference calling volume 
this increase was offset in part by decreases of approximately  and  from the telco access product tap and dsl products  respectively 
the decrease in tap revenue was primarily due to lower unit shipments as network providers continue their transition to digital products 
competitive pricing pressures and product mix also negatively affected telco access product revenues 
the decrease in dsl product revenue was due to lower average unit selling prices offset in part by increased unit volume 
the fiscal increase of million was primarily due to increases of million and million from the company s cpe and transport systems business units  respectively  resulting from increased shipments of dsl products 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of million from the tap business unit due to primarily to competitive pressures and product mix 
conference plus  inc revenue increased million  or  over fiscal resulting from increased audio conference calling volume 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year decreases in gross margin as a percent of revenue are primarily the result of aggressive pricing of dsl products in the cpe and transport systems business units and continued competitive pricing pressures and product mix changes in the tap business unit 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
sales and marketing was up slightly in fiscal due to increases at conference plus to support growth in the teleconference service revenue 
this increase was partially offset by decreases resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl sales and marketing 
in fiscal  sales and marketing decreased million 
this decrease is primarily due to cost reductions resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl sales efforts 
the company believes that continued investment in sales and marketing will be required to expand its product lines  bring new products to market and service customers 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
research and development expenses were essentially unchanged in fiscal reflecting positive results from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl research and development 
in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased million or from the previous year 
this decrease was due primarily to receiving million in fiscal from customers to fund on going engineering projects  which was offset against research and development expenses 
additionally  cost savings have resulted from the absence of costs related to the company s european operation  westell europe limited  which was eliminated early in fiscal the company believes that a continued investment in research and development will be required for the company to remain competitive 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
the fiscal decrease was primarily due to decreases resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl general and administrative functions 
these decreases were offset in part by infrastructure increases at conference plus to support growing teleconference service revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased  in fiscal due primarily to increases related to information systems enhancements and non employee stock option grants which were offset in part by cost reductions resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl efforts 
restructuring charge 
the company recognized a restructuring charge of million in the three months ended december  fiscal restructuring plan and  in the three months ended march  fiscal restructuring plan 
these charges included personnel  facility  and certain development contract costs related to restructuring global operations 
as of march   the company has paid million and  of the restructuring costs charged in fiscal and  respectively 
during the three months ending december   management determined that essentially all restructuring payments have been completed for fiscal and and therefore the remaining restructuring accrual balances for those periods of approximately  was reversed into income 
the fiscal restructuring plan was to decrease costs and streamline operations related to dsl products 
the fiscal restructuring plan was to further decrease costs  primarily by reducing the workforce by approximately  and focus dsl sales efforts on indirect sales to the major phone companies through licensing and oem arrangements with strategic partners 
the company recognized a restructuring charge of  in the three months ended march  this charge was for personnel  legal  and other related costs to eliminate redundant employees due to the acquisition of teltrend  inc the restructuring plan was to combine and streamline the operations of the two companies and to achieve synergies related to the manufacture and distribution of common product lines 
the company estimates the costs of these activities will be million 
approximately million of the total cost has been capitalized as part of the purchase price of teltrend inc primarily related to teltrend inc 
employees involuntarily terminated the remaining  has been charged to operations and relates to westell employees involuntarily terminated and other costs 
as of march   none of these costs have been paid

in fiscal  the company recognized other income of  for a foreign currency gain from the liquidation of westell europe ltd 
excluding the effects of these one time benefits  other income  net would have been million and  for fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
excluding these one time items  other income  net for the years ended march   and was primarily due to interest income earned on temporary cash investments made as a result of investing available funds 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease in interest expense was a result of reduced borrowings 
the fiscal increase in interest expense was a result of interest from the company s subordinated secured convertible debentures  warrants to purchase class a common stock and net obligations outstanding during the year under promissory notes and equipment borrowings

the tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in and the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in quarterly results of operations the following tables present the company s results of operations for each of the last eight fiscal quarters and the percentage relationship of certain items to revenues for the respective periods 
the company believes that the information regarding each of these quarters is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements of the company appearing elsewhere in this form k

 equipment service total revenues cost of equipment sales cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative goodwill amortization restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net interest expense loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net loss the company s quarterly equipment revenues have varied from quarter to quarter due to quarterly fluctuations in dsl revenues 
a majority of dsl shipments made in fiscal and were for initial service deployments and therefore have not yet created steady or predictable demand for these products on a quarter to quarter basis 
cpe and transport systems product revenues have increased fairly steadily in fiscal and due to increased demand for dsl products 
revenues from telco access products have declined steadily in fiscal and due to a combination of changes in product mix and continued competitive pricing pressures 
conference plus service revenues have seen steady growth throughout the eight quarters presented due primarily to increased audio conference calling traffic volume 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue has also varied from quarter to quarter 
the decreases in gross margins are primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and product mix changes in each of the company s equipment product lines as well as investments in manufacturing infrastructure 
the decreased gross margins in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal were primarily the result of recording forward pricing losses of million   and  respectively  for dsl orders received 
the lower margins in the fiscal quarters are primarily a result of the increased volume in dsl products that have relatively low margins 
additionally  the company s conference plus  inc subsidiary made additional infrastructure enhancements to handle increased call minutes which also impacted margins in fiscal and the company believes that its gross margin in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including market demand for the company s dsl products  pricing pressures  competitive technologies and manufacturing expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase gross margins in future periods due to these factors  even if its dsl products achieve market acceptance 
operating expenses increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal and decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating expenses decreased in fiscal quarters compared to fiscal primarily due to cost reductions resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl sales efforts and due to receiving payments from customers to fund on going engineering projects  which were offset against research and development expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased in each quarter of fiscal when compared to the same quarter in the previous year 
the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and on its ability to achieve profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper 
as of march   the company had no outstanding balance under its secured revolving promissory note facility and million outstanding under its equipment borrowing facility 
as of march   the company had approximately million available under the secured revolving promissory note facility 
the revolving promissory notes and the equipment borrowing facility required the maintenance of a minimum cash to current maturity ratio  a current ratio and a maximum debt to net worth ratio 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s operating activities used cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations before income tax of million net of depreciation offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations of million net of depreciation and working capital required by increases in prepaid expenses and receivables  and a decrease in accrued compensation offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million net of depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
working capital was affected primarily by increases in receivables  inventory and offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation 
the company received million in cash from the acquisition of teltrend inc merger related expenditures of million are expected in the first quarter of fiscal for investment banking  legal  accounting and other related fees 
restructuring expenditures of million are anticipated primarily relating to involuntary termination expenses  of which million is expected to be paid in fiscal with the remainder paid by fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were principally for machinery  computer and research equipment purchases 
the company expects to spend approximately million in fiscal for capital equipment 
at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were million of cash and cash equivalents and million under its secured revolving promissory notes facility and million available under the equipment borrowing facility 
borrowings under the secured revolving promissory notes facility which had  outstanding at march  and was unused at march  and the equipment borrowing facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate of and at march  and  respectively 
the company recorded forward pricing losses of million during fiscal for dsl orders received 
these losses effected results of operations in the quarters in which the orders were received 
substantially all of this loss  million of the recorded loss  was shipped prior to march  all of the orders remaining in the reserve were shipped in fiscal at march   no reserves existed 
there are no open orders where the costs to produce exceed the company s selling price the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million at march  this deferred tax asset relates to i tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  ii a net operating loss carryforward tax benefit of approximately million and iii temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws 
of such tax credit carryforwards  the first  of credits expire in and  of credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured  the company has incurred operating losses for the  and fiscal years  management believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the majority of the tax benefit 
a majority of these deferred tax assets are expected to be utilized  prior to their expiration  through a tax planning strategy available to the company 
at march  and march   management determined that the strategy was no longer sufficient to realize the amount deferred tax assets recorded and as such the company recorded a valuation allowance of million and million respectively 
at march   management re assessed the valuation of the company s deferred tax asset and determined that the tax planning strategy was sufficient to record additional tax assets of million 
management will continue to periodically assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
if the tax planning strategy is not sufficient to generate taxable income to recover the deferred tax benefit recorded  an increase in the valuation allowance will be required through a charge to the income tax provision 
however  if the company achieves sufficient profitability or has available additional tax planning strategies to utilize a greater portion of the deferred tax asset  an income tax benefit would be recorded to decrease the valuation allowance 
in april  the company completed a subordinated secured convertible debenture private placement totaling million 
as of may   holders of these debentures fully converted all principle and the accrued interest thereon of approximately  into  class a common shares at a conversion price of per share 
in connection with the financing  the company issued five year warrants for approximately  shares of class a common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which is approximately of the initial conversion price of the debentures and were determined to have a fair market value of million 
subsequently  in december  the company repriced the warrants from to per share and  due to this debt modification  increased the value of the warrants by approximately  the total value of the warrants  approximately million  was recorded as a debt discount in the accompanying march  consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized over the life of the convertible debentures of five years 
in june  the company entered into a strategic agreement with fujitsu telecommunications europe limited ftel on dsl and hdsl product development  manufacturing  and global marketing 
as part of this agreement  ftel will assist the company in the funding of certain future developments of dsl products 
additionally  employees of westell europe limited wel  the company s united kingdom operations  headquartered in cambridge  england  became employees of ftel 
furthermore  ftel assumed wel s lease of office space  purchased certain fixed assets and inventories of wel and earned manufacturing rights
