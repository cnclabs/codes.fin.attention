capital spending decisions will be based on both strategic needs and potential rate of return on a given capital investment 
the owners of the meristar hotels are primarily responsible for funding capital expenditures 
selective use of multiple brand names

d ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
management believes that ebitda is a useful measure of operating performance because i it is industry practice to evaluate hotel properties based on operating income before interest  depreciation and amortization and minority interests of common and preferred op unit holders  which is generally equivalent to ebitda  and ii ebitda is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the entity 
ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs  should not be considered as an alternative to net income under gaap for purposes of evaluating the company s results of operations and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are the lessee  manager and operator of a portfolio of primarily upscale  full service hotels in the united states and canada 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
our subsidiary  meristar h r operating company  lp  conducts all of our operations 
we are the sole general partner of meristar h r and control its operations 
on august   american general hospitality corporation and capstar hotel company merged together to form meristar hospitality corporation  a real estate investment trust 
as part of that merger  capstar formed our company to become the lessee  manager and operator of substantially all of the hotels owned or leased by american general and capstar before the merger 
at the time of the merger  capstar distributed all of the shares of our common stock to its stockholders and we became a separate  publicly traded company 
we manage all of the hotels capstar leased and or managed for third party owners before the merger 
immediately after the merger  we acquired all of the partnership interests in agh leasing  lp  the third party lessee that leased most of the hotels american general owned 
we also acquired substantially all of the assets and some liabilities of american general hospitality  inc  the third party manager that managed most of the hotels american general owned 
our financial statements include the historical results of the management and leasing operations of capstar for all periods and include the operating results of agh leasing and american general hospitality  inc since august  in addition  before august   we managed substantially all of the hotels owned by capstar and received management fee revenues from those hotels 
since august   we have leased these hotels from meristar hospitality corporation 
we have not recorded management fees from these hotels 
we have recorded room  food and beverage and other operating department revenues and expenses from these leases 
therefore  our results of operations for the periods ended december   and reflect significantly differing numbers of managed and leased hotels throughout the periods 
the following table outlines our historical portfolio of managed and leased hotels as of december meristar hospitality corporation capstar third party other leased owned managed leased total hotels rooms hotels rooms hotels rooms hotels rooms hotels rooms we also manage five golf courses for third party owners 
our golf course management operations are not material to any period presented 
financial condition assets our total assets increased by million to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the following 
investments in and advances to affiliates increased by million due to our investment in mip lessee  lp and our purchase of the investment in radisson hallmark from meristar hospitality corporation during  
accounts receivable decreased million due to more effective collection efforts and to a decrease in our guest ledger receivables  
cash and cash equivalents decreased million resulting from the paydown of our debt  and 
net fixed assets increased million resulting from enhancements made to our information technology systems 
our assets include a substantial amount of intangible assets  primarily related to our acquisitions of hotel management companies in and we evaluate the carrying values of our long lived intangible assets periodically in relation to their operating performance and expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets 
through december   our evaluations have not indicated a need to adjust the carrying value of our intangible assets 
over the past two years  however  the lodging industry has experienced the negative effects of the supply of new rooms in some segments and geographic regions exceeding demand 
as a result  we will continue to regularly evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets 
minority interests and paid in capital minority interests decreased million primarily due to the conversion of partnership interests see the operating partnership on page for more information to our common stock during the year 
the conversion of these partnership interests and the sale of  shares of our common stock to our joint venture partner in mip lessee  lp on april  caused paid in capital to increase 
results of operations compared to revenues total revenue increased or to  million in compared to million in the increase in revenue is primarily the result of an increase in the number of hotels leased as described previously 
during the period january  through august   the revenue is from capstar s management and leasing operations 
from august  through december  and for all of  the revenue also includes the management and leasing operations of agh leasing and american general hospitality  inc as a result  the revenue was derived from a smaller number of hotels being leased and managed throughout the year 
in addition  the significant increase in revenues from our resort properties is due to the acquisition of the south seas resorts 
we acquired this portfolio of resort properties during the fourth quarter of therefore  there are only three months of revenue included in and a full months of revenue included in from these properties 
the increase as it relates to our three operating segments is as follows revenues hotels inns resorts year ended december     for the period august  through december     the segment information for only includes five months of operations  from august  the date of the spin off through december  since there is a full year of operations for  the segment information is not comparable 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million or to  million in compared to million in the increase reflects the increase in the number of leased and managed hotels 
this increase is consistent with the increase in revenues 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased to million in compared to million in the increase in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is due to the change in the number of hotels operated and managed by us in compared to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for our three operating segments is as follows earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization hotels inns resorts year ended december     for the period august  through december   the segment information for earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for includes a full year of operations 
the information only includes five months of operations  from august  date of the spin off through december  therefore  the segment information for earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is not comparable 
minority interest and taxes increased by million and million  respectively  due to higher operating income as compared to compared to revenues total revenue increased to million in compared to million in the increase in revenues is primarily a result of the increase in the number of hotels leased and managed as described above 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million to million in compared to million in the increase reflects the increase in the number of leased and managed hotels 
this increase resulted in additional personnel and other administrative costs in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is due to the change in the number of hotels leased and managed in compared to liquidity and capital resources sources of cash our continuing operations are funded through cash generated from hotel management and leasing operations 
we finance business acquisitions and investments in affiliates through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings and the issuance of partnership interests and or common stock 
we generated million from operations in under the terms of the participating lease agreements with our lessors  our lessors will generally be required to fund significant capital expenditures at the hotels we lease 
uses of cash we used million of cash in investing activities during primarily for the following 
our additional million of investments in hotel partnerships 
we used million of cash in financing activities during primarily for the following 
million of net principal payments on our credit facility with meristar hospitality corporation  and 
we received million from the issuances of our common stock 
revolving credit facilities on august   we entered into a three year  million revolving credit facility with meristar hospitality corporation 
this loan contains covenants regarding financial ratios  reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
the interest rate on this loan is based on the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
as of december   we borrowed million 
at december   the interest rate was 
on february   we entered into a million senior secured credit facility among a syndicate of banks 
the credit facility bears interest at the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points and expires in february with an optional one year extension 
we drew down million at an interest rate of to repay the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement with meristar hospitality corporation 
upon execution of this new credit facility  the facility with meristar hospitality corporation was amended to reduce the maximum borrowing limit from million to million 
summary we believe cash generated by our operations  together with anticipated borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service 
we expect to continue to seek acquisitions of hotel  resort and golf management businesses and management contracts 
in addition  we expect to expand our business into timeshare development and management and corporate extended stay housing 
we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of additional borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of partnership interests and or our common stock 
we believe these sources of capital will be sufficient to provide for our long term capital needs 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in winter and early spring 
since the majority of our hotels are non resort properties  our operations generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
excluding the effect of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for contingent rent in interim financial periods  we have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
year conversion we have reviewed our computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year problem and implemented a plan to address the problem 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  this could result in a major systems failure or miscalculations 
our hotel properties contain various information technology and embedded technology systems 
both types of systems contain microprocessors and microcontrollers that must be assessed for year compliance 
we identified the following six phases in our year remediation programs increase awareness of issue  assign responsibility for coordinating response to issue  information collection  analysis  modification  repair or replacement and testing 
we completed all six phases and believe these systems are year compliant 
as an additional part of our implementation plan to address the year problem  we initiated communications with third parties with which we have material relationships to determine the extent of their potential year problems 
the most critical of these services involve such items as reservations systems for our hotels 
without such systems  we could suffer a material decline in business at many of our properties 
we completed our communications and assessment of these outside parties services in september as of march   we have not encountered any significant year problems related to third parties services provided to us 
we incurred costs for outside consultants and capital expenditures in and related to year which totaled approximately  these costs  which were expensed as incurred  were funded through operations 
the costs through december  did not have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations 
future consulting and capital acquisition costs are expected to be insignificant 
we are responsible for costs incurred at our corporate offices related to year the owners of the hotels we operate are responsible for costs incurred at their hotel properties 
as of march   we have not encountered any significant year related problems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our credit facility with meristar hospitality corporation that impacts the fair value of this obligation 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
we have not entered into any derivative or interest rate transactions 
our long term debt of million at december  matures in august interest on the debt is variable  based on the day london interbank offered rate plus basis points 
the interest rate was at december  we have determined that the fair value of the debt approximates its carrying value 
although we conduct business in canada  the canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of december  additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
