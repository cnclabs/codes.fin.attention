item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview of fiscal our operating results and financial condition for fiscal reflect the further expansion of our energy operations continuing a trend which began with the acquisition of atlas group now atlas america at the end of fiscal and continued with the acquisition of viking resources at the end of fiscal the importance of our energy operations was significantly increased in fiscal as a result of the discontinuance and sale of our equipment leasing business 
the expansion of our energy operations over the past three years is shown in the following tables  which have been restated to reflect the sale of our equipment leasing business revenues as a percent of total revenues years ended september  energy real estate finance assets as a percent of total assets september  energy real estate finance the balance in  in and in is attributable to revenues derived from corporate assets not allocated to a specific industry segment  including cash and the common shares held in rait 
the balance in  in and in is attributable to corporate assets not attributable to a specific industry segment  as referred to above 
energy assets expressed as a percent of total assets  excluding cash  were  and for the fiscal years ending september  and  respectively 
before the sale of our equipment leasing business  for fiscal equipment leasing had accounted for of our revenues and of our assets  while real estate finance had accounted for of our revenues and of our assets and energy had accounted for of our revenues and of our assets 
the discontinuance and sale of our equipment leasing business also significantly affected our liquidity and capital resources by increasing our cash and cash equivalents to million of total assets at september  as compared to million of total assets at september  in october  we used a portion million of the september  cash balance to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at per share in a dutch auction tender offer 
in addition  we used million to repurchase  shares in a private transaction 
results of operations energy in september and august  we acquired atlas group and viking resources  respectively 
results of operations for the respective years of acquisition include the operations of these companies from their respective dates of acquisition and  accordingly  are not comparable to the similar periods of the prior years 
the following tables set forth information relating to revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred  daily production volumes  average sales prices  production costs as a percentage of natural gas and oil sales  and production cost per equivalent unit for our energy operations during fiscal  and years ended september  in thousands revenues production    well drilling   well services    transportation   gain on sales of assets  costs and expenses exploration and production    well drilling   well services    transportation  non direct   years ended september  revenues in thousands gas    oil   production volumes gas thousands of cubic feet mcf day    oil barrels bbls day average sales price gas per mcf oil per bbl production costs as a percent of sales gas per mcf 

oil per bbl excludes sales of residual gas and sales to landowners 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the completion of wells and the additional viking resources production  and a increase in the average sales price of natural gas 
of the million increase in gas revenues  million was attributable to volume increases while million was attributable to price increases 
our oil revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the additional viking resources production  and a increase in the average sales price of oil 
of the million increase in oil revenues  million was attributable to volume increases while  was attributable to price increases 
without the addition of viking resources  gas and oil revenues would have been million and million  respectively  resulting in an overall increase of million compared to fiscal average daily gas production volumes would have been  mcf  a increase compared to the average sales price per mcf would have been per mcf as compared to per mcf 
average daily oil production volumes would have decreased barrels per day from  offset by a increase in the average sales price per barrel of oil to 
our well drilling revenues and expenses in fiscal represent the billing and costs associated with the completion of wells for partnerships sponsored by atlas america and viking resources as compared to wells completed in fiscal  an increase of wells 
well services revenues and related costs increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of wells operated due to the acquisition of viking resources and the operations associated with new partnership wells drilled during the year 
transportation revenues increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this increase principally resulted from the additional revenue associated with the viking pipeline systems 
our production costs  excluding exploration costs of million  increased million to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of viking resources interests in producing properties and the drilling activities referred to above 
our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal fiscal non direct expenses increased due to the growth in our energy division 
atlas pipeline partners  a public entity  was formed in february and incurs those normal costs associated wiith public entities 
fiscal also includes a full twelve months of costs associated with viking 
finally  certain allocations changed such that more costs remain in non direct expense  rather than being allocated to another energy function production  drilling  well services  well operations 
amortization of oil and gas property costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the variance from period to period is directly attributable to changes in our oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of our gas and oil properties 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues increased to million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the added atlas america production  partially offset by an decrease in the average sales price of natural gas 
of the million increase in gas revenues  million was attributable to volume increases which was partially offset by  in price decreases 
our oil revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of  from  in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the added atlas america production and a increase in the average sales price of oil 
of the  increase in oil revenues   was attributable to volume increases while  was attributable to price increases 
without the additions of atlas america and viking resources  gas and oil revenues would have been million and  respectively  resulting in an overall decrease of  compared to average daily gas production volumes would have been  mcf  a decrease compared to the average sales price per mcf would have been per mcf as compared to 
average daily oil production would have increased barrels over  offset by a decrease in the average sales price per barrel to 
our well drilling revenues and expenses in fiscal represent the billing and costs associated with the completion of wells for partnerships sponsored by atlas america 
well services revenues and related costs increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of wells operated due to the acquisition of the atlas group and viking resources 
our transportation revenues increased million to million in the year ended september  as compared to the same period of the prior year 
of this increase  million was associated with the atlas pipeline operations acquired in september our production costs  excluding exploration costs of  increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the atlas group and viking resources acquisitions 
our transportation expenses increased  to  as compared the same period of the prior year  of the increase   was related to the atlas pipeline operations acquired in september our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from  in fiscal this increase was due to the additional ongoing expenses associated with atlas america 
amortization of oil and gas property costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in the year ended september  compared to in the year ended september  the variance from period to period was directly attributable to changes in our natural gas and oil reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of natural gas and oil properties 
results of operations real estate finance during fiscal  we focused on managing our existing portfolio of real estate loans rather than on acquiring further real estate loans 
as a result of this shift in focus  as well as the sale of three portfolio loans and the partial repayment of two additional loans with a book value of million  our portfolio decreased from loans with a book value of million in fiscal to loans with a book value of million in fiscal the following table sets forth certain information relating to the revenue recognized and cost and expenses incurred in our commercial real estate finance operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenue interest    accreted discount net of collection of interest    gains on sales of senior lien interests and loans    net rental and fee income   cost and expenses    year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate finance operations decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to the following o a decrease of million in interest income  including a decrease of million of accretion of discount  attributable to the following the repayment in june of a loan which decreased interest income by million during fiscal compared to fiscal the repayment by a borrower in october of approximately million of another loan  which decreased interest income by million during fiscal compared to fiscal three additional loans were repaid during fiscal resulting in a decrease in interest income of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the completion of accretion of discount in fiscal on five loans as to which million accretion had been taken in fiscal o a decrease of million in net rental and fee income during fiscal  to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from one time fees of million and million earned in fiscal for services rendered to property owners in connection with the operation  leasing and supervision of the collateral securing two of our portfolio loans 
we earned no comparable fees during fiscal in addition  we experienced a non cash loss on one rental real estate venture of approximately  in fiscal  attributable to accounting for the investment on the equity method 
o a decrease of million in gains on sales of senior lien interests and loans due to a decrease in the number of loans sold 
prior to january   we structured most of our transactions in which senior lien interests were created to meet the criteria under generally accepted accounting principles for sales of those interests to the senior lienors 
effective january   we made a strategic decision to structure future transactions as financings rather than as sales 
thus  for most transactions that were completed prior to january   we recorded a gain on sale which we included in our revenues  refinancing proceeds received subsequent to that date  although included in our cash flow  are not recordable as revenues under generally accepted accounting principles 
this policy change resulted in a shift from the recognition of an immediate gain upon the sale of a senior lien interest in a loan receivable to the recognition of interest income over the life of the loan receivable 
however  during fiscal  we sold three loans and were partially repaid on a fourth loan  resulting in gains of million 
costs and expenses of our real estate finance operations increased  to million in the year ended september  we attribute the increase primarily to the increase in professional fees 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate finance operations decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to a decrease of million in gains from sales of senior lien interests and loans 
the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of loans sold or loans in which senior lien interests were sold from loans in fiscal to two loans in fiscal due to the change in structure of our financing transactions as referred to in our discussion of fiscal above 
the change in structure did not  however  affect our cash flow from financing transactions 
the decrease in gain on sale revenues was partially offset by an increase of million in our interest income  including an increase of million of accretion of discount  of which million resulted from accretion of discount adjustments we made in connection with the june loan repayment referred to in our discussion of fiscal  above 
in addition  two loans acquired at the end of fiscal contributed million of interest income in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal as a consequence of these factors  our yield decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal costs and expenses of our real estate finance operations increased million to million in the year ended september  the increase primarily resulted from hiring additional personnel  increased compensation to existing employees and legal costs relating to management of our portfolio 
results of operations other revenues  costs and expenses year ended september  compared to year ended september  our interest and other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal primarily resulted from intercompany interest on increased lending to our discontinued small ticket equipment leasing subsidiary million 
also  as a result ofa substantial increase in our uncommitted cash balances from the sale of our equipment leasing operations  and the temporary investment of such balances interest income increased by  our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase primarily resulted from increases in pension costs million  occupancy costs  insurance and taxes  our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from depletion million and amortization and depreciation million associated with the acquisition of viking resources 
our interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from the repayment of one loan in october and lower average borrowings on our credit facilities partially offset by higher interest rates as compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  because of the sale of our leasing operation and the re emphasis on our energy operations  both our president and vice chairman of the board  who was also president of the commercial real estate finance business  were separated from the company 
both officers were parties to employment agreements and were terminated in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
accordingly  continuing results of operations were charged million and discontinued operations were charged million 
the minority interest in atlas pipeline partners  lp represents of the net earnings of atlas pipeline as a result of the sale in february of our natural gas gathering operations to atlas pipeline 
because we own more than of atlas pipeline it is included in our consolidated financial statements and the ownership by the public is shown as a minority interest 
our equity in the loss of an unconsolidated affiliate represents of the net loss of optiron and its predecessor  and a provision for possible losses of  against advances made 
our provision for possible losses increased to  in fiscal  an increase of  from  in fiscal this increase resulted from an increase to the provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal caused by the partial write down of one loan in the amount of  during the fourth quarter of our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  as a result of a reduction in pre tax earnings  coupled with a consistent level of permanent differences between book and taxable income 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our interest and other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal  as a result of the following o a substantial decrease in our uncommitted cash balances decreased interest income by million as compared to fiscal o reimbursement  in the third quarter of fiscal  of payroll and administrative costs in the amount of  for services we provided to a partnership in connection with the partnership s investment in an unrelated business in which our former president is the president of the general partner 
there were no similar reimbursements in fiscal o the above increases were partially offset by of million of dividend income from rait in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of hiring additional corporate staff and increases in the compensation of senior officers  together with an increase in occupancy costs as we leased additional office space to accommodate our increased staff 
interest expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million as from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting increased borrowings in our real estate and energy divisions 
our effective tax rate decreased to in the year ended september  from in the year ended september  the fiscal decrease resulted from an increase in the generation of depletion for tax purposes due to the atlas group acquisition and an increase in tax credits 
these increases in tax benefits were partially offset by an increase in state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources following the sale of our equipment leasing operations  our major sources of liquidity have been the proceeds of that sale  funds generated by operations  and borrowings under our existing energy and real estate finance credit facilities 
we have employed these funds principally in the expansion of our energy operations and repurchase of senior notes 
the following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the years ended september    and years ended september  in thousands provided by operations   provided by used in investing activities    used in provided by financing activities    used in discontinued operations    increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    after the end of fiscal  we employed million of our funds to repurchase  shares of our common stock in a dutch auction tender offer and million to repurchase  shares of our common stock in a private transaction 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to to in the fiscal year ended september  cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased  as compared to fiscal the increase is mostly due to an additional million in non cash charges offset by a million decrease in accretion net of interest and a million gain on disposal from our two discontinued subsidiaries 
our cash provided by investing activities increased million in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  primarily as a result of the following o proceeds from sale of our equipment leasing operations increased cash provided by investing activities million during fiscal o principal payments on notes receivable increased million mostly due to the sale or refinancing of four real estate loans during fiscal year o lower investments in real estate loans and ventures increased investing cash flows in fiscal year by million as compared to fiscal year our cash flows used in financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to the fiscal year ended september  this increase resulted from a million change in net borrowings in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this change is offset by the net proceeds of million from the sale of our gathering systems to atlas pipeline 
there was no comparable sale in fiscal year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september   as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in the year ended september  as compared to to in the year ended september  cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal primarily the increase is due to an increase of million in non cash changes offset by increased losses from our discontinued subsidiaries of million coupled with a decrease of million in accretion of discount net of interest 
our cash used in investing activities increased million in the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  as a result of the following o in energy  cash used increased million principally as a result of our participation in the drilling of wells through atlas america million and cash used to acquire viking resources million 
o in real estate finance  cash used increased million as a result of a decrease of million in principal payments and proceeds from the sale of loans  offset by a decrease in investments in real estate loans and ventures 
o cash used also decreased as a result of a million investment in rait in fiscal which was not repeated in fiscal our cash flow provided by financing activities decreased million during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase resulted from a million increase in our net borrowings  and a decrease of million in purchases of treasury stock  partially offset by a decrease of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in fiscal resulting from an offering of common stock in fiscal there was no comparable offering in fiscal dividends in the years ended september   and  million  million and million were paid in dividends  respectively 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends since august the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid is in the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting our financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant  including restrictions which may be imposed pursuant to the indenture under which the senior notes were issued 
environmental regulation a continuing trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has generally resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry 
we monitor environmental and safety laws and believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  however  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we believe  however  that environmental and safety costs will increase in the future 
we cannot offer you any assurance that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations

we do not believe that these loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates since o the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and thus are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  o all senior lien interests are at fixed rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and o each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flow were to exceed the interest rate  as originally underwritten
