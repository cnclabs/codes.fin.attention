the engine segment s profit increased by in and in compared to revenue increases of and  respectively 
during the company s truck segment was adversely affected by decreased industry volume related to the declining overall industry as well as reduced truck pricing and increases in material costs 
the engine segment s profit and revenue increases during were  in part  due to record levels of engine shipments to other original equipment manufacturers oems 
the truck and engine segments profit increases in results of operations continued were attributable to economies of scale in truck and engine production  improved truck pricing and various other cost improvements 
the financial services segment s profit in decreased million from primarily due to a decrease in nfc s pretax income from continuing operations 
nfc s pretax income from continuing operations in was million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower gains on the sale of retail notes and higher losses on retail receivables  partially offset by higher average finance receivable balances 
the financial services segment s profit in was million higher than in  primarily resulting from an increase in nfc s pretax income and a legal settlement in favor of an insurance subsidiary of the company

shipments of mid range diesel engines by the company to other oems during were a record  units  a increase over the  units shipped in  which represented a increase over higher shipments to ford motor company ford to meet consumer demand for light trucks and vans which use this engine was the primary cause of the increases in both and finance and insurance revenue was million for  a million increase over revenue of million  which was million higher than revenue of million 
the increase in was primarily a result of an increase in lease financing  while the increase in was impacted significantly by greater wholesale and retail financing activity 
the company recorded other income of million in this decreased from the million reported for  which was an increase of million from lower cash balances  which reduced interest income  was a significant factor in the decrease in  while the increase in was primarily due to a legal settlement in favor of an insurance subsidiary of the company 
results of operations continued costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin was in  compared with in  and in excluding the effect of the restructuring charge  the company s manufacturing gross margin was in the decrease in margin primarily results from lower new truck pricing  declines in used truck values and increases in material costs 
the gross margin increase experienced in was primarily due to improved pricing and improved operating efficiencies 
postretirement benefits expense of million in decreased million from million in  which increased million from million reported in the decrease is primarily due to lower pension expense as well as lower profit sharing provisions to the retiree trust  which was partially offset by increased health and life insurance expense 
the increase was mainly a result of higher retiree healthcare expense and higher profit sharing provisions to the retiree trust 
see note to the financial statements 
engineering and research expense in was million  which was consistent with the million reported in  but an increase from the million in the increase in over reflected the company s continuing investment in its next generation vehicle ngv and next generation diesel ngd programs 
ngv represented of the increase while ngd accounted for another 
sales  general and administrative expense of million in was comparable to the million in  which was higher than the million reported in the increase was primarily due to marketing programs and the operational implementation of the company s integrated truck and engine strategies 
interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the rise in was partially attributable to the financial services segment s increased borrowing costs related to higher average receivable funding requirements and higher average interest rates 
the increase in was  in part  driven by higher average receivable funding requirements due to higher sales

approximately million was spent in and the remaining million is expected to be spent as follows million  million and and beyond million 
the total cash outlay is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows from operations 
the specific actions included in the plan of restructuring are expected to be substantially complete by november and the charge reflects costs and expenses that are incremental to the current period and are directly related to the plan of restructuring 
the actions taken to implement the plan of restructuring are expected to generate approximately million in annualized savings for the company  primarily from lower salaries and benefit costs  beginning in fiscal these savings are expected to be more than offset by lower revenue from expected industry driven reductions in annual truck and engine sales volumes 
components of the restructuring charge are as follows amount balance millions of dollars total charges incurred october  severance and other benefits inventory write downs other asset write downs and losses lease terminations loss on anticipated sale of business exit costs total the severance and other benefit costs  asset write downs and losses  lease terminations  loss on anticipated sale of business  dealer termination and exit costs  totaling million  are presented as restructuring and loss on anticipated sale of business in the statement of income 
inventory write down costs of million are included in cost of products sold related to restructuring in the statement of income 
a description of the significant components of the restructuring charge is as follows pursuant to the plan of restructuring   positions will be eliminated throughout the company 
severance and other benefit costs relate to the reduction of approximately  employees from the workforce  primarily in north america 
of the total workforce reductions  approximately  will be in international s truck group  of which approximately  are production related employees  with the remainder impacting the engine  corporate and financial services groups 
as of october   approximately million had been paid for severance and other benefits for nearly terminated employees 
the remaining reduction of approximately  employees will be substantially complete by late when the majority of the ngv products will be in production 
the reduction is primarily caused by a reduction in the required workforce to assemble the new medium trucks  a lowering of anticipated industry demand for certain products and the movement of products between manufacturing facilities 
benefit costs will extend beyond the completion of the workforce reductions due to the company s contractual severance obligations 
additionally  the severance and other benefits component includes a million non cash curtailment loss related to the company s postretirement benefit plans 
restructuring charge continued in  international announced the extension of its engine contract for v engines with ford until this contract extension included the development of new engines that provide better performance and meet stricter emissions requirements 
as part of the plan of restructuring  the company finalized its plan for this new engine 
the plan requires that certain existing production assets be either replaced or disposed 
accordingly  international entered into sale leaseback transactions in october for certain of these affected production assets  which resulted in the recognition of a million charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of these assets 
in addition  a charge of million was recorded for the impairment of other engine production assets held for disposal and million was recognized for the write down of engine and service inventory that will be replaced 
international s preparation for the launch of ngv  a new line of high performance steel cab trucks  which begins in march resulted in the write off of million of excess truck parts and service inventory related to prior vehicle models 
the remainder of the asset write downs and losses primarily relate to assets that will be disposed of or abandoned as a direct result of the workforce reductions 
lease termination costs include the future obligations under long term non cancelable lease agreements at facilities being vacated following the workforce reductions 
this charge primarily consists of the estimated lease costs  net of probable sublease income  associated with the cancelation of the company s corporate office lease at nbc tower in chicago  illinois  which expires in as part of the plan of restructuring  management evaluated the strategic importance of certain of its operations 
on november   nfc s board of directors approved nfc management s plan to sell harco within the next fiscal year 
the effect of the anticipated sale of harco is reflected as a discontinued operation in nfc s stand alone financial statements because harco represents a major line of business and a reportable operating segment of nfc 
however  because harco is not a major line of business nor a separate operating segment of navistar  the planned sale of harco does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and accordingly  the anticipated loss on disposal is included as a component of the restructuring charge 
additionally  due to the anticipated sale of harco within the next fiscal year  all of harco s assets and liabilities have been classified as current within the statement of financial position

liquidity and capital resources cash flow is generated from the manufacture and sale of trucks and mid range diesel engines and their associated service parts as well as from product financing and insurance coverage provided to the company s dealers and retail customers by the financial services segment 
the company s current debt ratings have made sales of finance receivables the most economic sources of funding for nfc 
insurance operations are self funded

investment programs also used cash for a million net increase in retail notes and lease receivables and a million net increase in property and equipment leased to others 
these were partially offset by a net decrease in marketable securities of million and proceeds from sale leasebacks of million 
financing activities provided a million net increase in notes and debt outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility and other commercial paper programs  and a million net increase in long term debt 
these were offset by purchases of million of common stock during in accordance with board approved spending levels

liquidity and capital resources continued in october  nfc entered into a million revolving retail facility as a method to fund retail notes and finance leases prior to the sale of receivables 
under the terms of this facility  nfc sells fixed rate retail notes or finance leases to the conduit and pays investors a floating rate of interest 
as required by the rating agencies  nfc purchased an interest rate cap to protect investors against rising interest rates 
to offset the economic cost of this cap  nfc sold an identical interest rate cap 
as of october  the interest rate caps each had a notional amount of million and a net fair value of zero 
during  nfc established truck retail accounts corporation trac  a special purpose wholly owned subsidiary of nfc  for the purpose of securitizing retail accounts receivable

the transaction provides for funding of million and expires in nfc has a million bank revolving credit facility and a million revolving retail warehouse facility program  which mature in march and october  respectively 
as of october   available funding under the bank revolving credit facility and the revolving retail warehouse facility program was million 
when combined with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million remained available to fund the general business purposes of nfc 
subsequent to october   nfc renegotiated its revolving credit agreement 
the new agreement provides for aggregate borrowings of million and will mature in november under the new revolving credit agreement  navistar s three mexican finance subsidiaries will be permitted to borrow up to million in the aggregate  which will be guaranteed by nfc 
the statement of financial position reflects million of navistar s bank revolvers due march as long term debt at october   since navistar has refinanced million of the obligation on a long term basis 
in conjunction with nfc s november sale of retail receivables  nfc issued an interest rate cap for the protection of investors in nfc s debt securities 
the notional amount of the cap  million  amortizes based on the expected outstanding principal balance of the sold retail receivables 
under the terms of the cap agreement  nfc will make payments if interest rates exceed certain levels 
the interest rate cap is recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income 
at october   the impact on income was not material 
in november  nfc sold million of fixed rate retail receivables on a variable rate basis and entered into an amortizing interest rate swap agreement to fix the future cash flows of interest paid to lenders 
in march  nfc transferred all of the rights and obligations of the swap to the bank conduit 
the notional amount of the amortizing swap is based on the expected outstanding principal balance of the sold retail receivables 
under the terms of the agreement  nfc will make or receive payments based on the difference between the transferred swap notional amount and the outstanding principal balance of the sold retail receivables 
as of october  the difference between the amortizing swap notional amount and the net outstanding principal balance of the sold retail receivables was million 
at october   the company held german mark forward contracts with notional amounts of million and other derivative contracts with notional amounts of million

the canadian operating subsidiary  nfc and certain other subsidiaries included in the financial services operations are parties to agreements that may result in the restriction of amounts which can be distributed to international in the form of dividends or loans and advances 
at october   the maximum amount of dividends which were available for distribution under the most restrictive covenants was million 
nfc s maximum contractual exposure under all receivable sale recourse provisions at october   was million 
however  management believes the recorded reserves for losses on sold receivables are adequate 
see note to the financial statements 
the company and international are obligated under certain agreements with public and private lenders of nfc to maintain the subsidiary s income before interest expense and income taxes at not less than of its total interest expense 
no income maintenance payments were required for the three years ended october  in february  standard and poor s raised the company s and nfc s senior debt ratings from bb to bbb  and raised the company s and nfc s subordinated debt ratings from bb to bb

nfc s senior debt ratings increased from ba and bbb to baa and bbb  respectively 
nfc s subordinated debt ratings were also raised from ba and bb to ba and bbb  respectively 
it is the opinion of management that  in the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands  current and forecasted cash flow will provide a basis for financing operating requirements and capital expenditures 
management also believes that collections on the outstanding receivables portfolios as well as funds available from various funding sources will permit the financial services operations to meet the financing requirements of the company s dealers and customers 
environmental matters the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp  in conjunction with other parties  in a number of cases arising under an environmental protection law  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  popularly known as the superfund law 
these cases involve sites  which allegedly have received wastes from current or former company locations 
based on information available to the company  which  in most cases  consists of data related to quantities and characteristics of material generated at  or shipped to  each site as well as cost estimates from prps and or federal or state regulatory agencies for the cleanup of these sites  a reasonable estimate is calculated of the company s share  if any  of the probable costs and is provided for in the financial statements 
these obligations are generally recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and are not discounted to their present value 
the company reviews its accruals on a regular basis and believes that  based on these calculations  its share of the potential additional costs for the cleanup of each site will not have a material effect on the company s financial results 
derivative financial instruments as disclosed in notes and to the financial statements  the company uses derivative financial instruments to transfer or reduce the risks of foreign exchange and interest rate volatility  and potentially increase the return on invested funds 
derivative financial instruments continued the company s manufacturing operations  as conditions warrant  hedge foreign exchange exposure on the purchase of parts and materials from foreign countries and its exposure from the sale of manufactured products in other countries 
contracted purchases of commodities or manufacturing equipment may also be hedged 
the financial services operations may use forward contracts to hedge interest payments on the notes and certificates related to an expected sale of receivables 
the financial services operations also use interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate changes when they sell fixed rate receivables on a variable rate basis 
for the protection of investors in nfc s securities  nfc may enter into interest rate caps when fixed rate receivables are sold on a variable rate basis 
year the company had instituted a corporate wide year readiness project to identify all systems  which required modification or replacement  and established appropriate remediation and contingency plans to avoid an impact on the company s ability to continue to provide its products and services 
through the date of this report  the company has not experienced any significant year problems 
the company s total cost of the year project  which was funded through operating cash flows  was million including million of expense and million of capital expenditures 
new accounting pronouncements on november   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
when certain criteria are met  it also provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the derivative hedging instrument with the recognition of a the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
in november  navistar recorded an immaterial cumulative transition adjustment to earnings primarily related to foreign currency derivatives 
additionally  the company recorded an immaterial cumulative transition adjustment in other comprehensive income for designated cash flow hedges 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities which the company must adopt for all applicable transactions occurring after march  the company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
income taxes the statement of financial condition at october  and includes a deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively  net of valuation allowances of million for both and  related to future tax benefits 
the deferred tax asset has been reduced by the valuation allowance as management believes it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
income taxes continued the deferred tax asset includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative tax losses of million and temporary differences  which represent the cumulative expense of  million recorded in the statement of income that has not been deducted on the company s tax returns 
the valuation allowance at october   assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately million of cumulative tax losses will not be realized before their expiration date 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of approximately  million of future taxable income 
until the company has utilized its significant net operating loss carryforwards  the cash payment of us federal income taxes will be minimal 
see note to the financial statements 
the company performs extensive analysis to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based on the premise that the company is  and will continue to be  a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of the company 
the financial results are evaluated using a number of alternatives in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
one significant factor considered is the company s role as a leading producer of heavy and medium trucks and school buses and mid range diesel engines 
the income tax expense was reduced by million for research and development tax credits that will be taken against future income tax payments related to research and development activities that occurred over the last several years 
in  as a result of increased industry demand  the continued successful implementation of the company s manufacturing strategies  changes in the company s operating structure  and other positive operating indicators  management reviewed its projected future taxable income and evaluated the impact of these changes on its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
this review was completed during the third quarter of and resulted in a reduction to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  which was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in addition  a million reduction in the allowance was recorded during the fourth quarter of based on a similar review 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of significant market share  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of million 
reconciliation of the company s income before income taxes for financial statement purposes to us taxable income for the years ended october is as follows millions of dollars income before income taxes exclusion of income of foreign subsidiaries state income taxes temporary differences other taxable income business environment sales of class through trucks have historically been cyclical  with demand affected by such economic factors as industrial production  construction  demand for consumer durable goods  interest rates and the earnings and cash flow of dealers and customers 
truck sales in have been hindered by a number of factors including higher fuel prices  driver shortages  higher interest rates  and increased new and used truck inventories 
the demand for new trucks reflected these adverse conditions as the number of new truck orders dropped significantly throughout  reducing the order backlog 
the company s us and canadian order backlog at october  was  units  compared with  units at october  historically  retail deliveries have been impacted by the rate at which new truck orders are received 
therefore  the company continually evaluates order receipts and backlog throughout the year and will balance production with demand as appropriate 
to control costs and align production schedules with demand  the company reduced its production schedules during through shutdown weeks at the chatham and springfield assembly plants 
the company currently projects us and canadian class heavy truck demand to be  units  down from class   and medium truck demand  excluding school buses is forecast at  units  lower than in demand for school buses is expected to decrease in to  units 
at these demand levels  the entire truck industry will be operating below capacity 
mid range diesel engine shipments by the company to oems in are expected to be  units  below  reflecting an anticipated softening in passenger car demand 
the company announced in may of that its green diesel technology tm will be available in the summer of on the international r rear engine school bus with an international r e engine 
the technology will surpass emissions standards while maintaining an engine with diesel s power 
in fiscal  the company finalized an agreement with ford to supply diesel engines for certain under  lbs 
gvw light duty trucks and sport utility vehicles 
to support this program  the company is constructing an engine assembly operation in huntsville  alabama 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the company is also exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used in its manufacturing operations and to changes in the prices of equity instruments owned by the company 
commodity price risk related to the company s current commodity financial instruments and equity price risk related to the company s current investments in equity instruments are not material 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate market risk 
these procedures include the monitoring of the company s level of exposure to each market risk  the funding of variable rate receivables with variable rate debt  and limiting the amount of fixed rate receivables  which may be funded with floating rate debt 
these procedures also include the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations and to reduce the exposure to exchange rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in interest rates as of october  and  the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately million in each year 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
foreign currency risk is the risk that the company will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are the canadian dollar us dollar  mexican dollar us dollar and brazilian dollar us dollar 
at october  and  the potential reduction in future earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments would be approximately million in each year 
the foreign currency sensitivity model is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which the company is exposed would simultaneously decrease by  because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the effects of foreign currency forward contracts have been included in the above analysis  however  the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with the anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currency for which these forward contracts have been entered into for hedging purposes
