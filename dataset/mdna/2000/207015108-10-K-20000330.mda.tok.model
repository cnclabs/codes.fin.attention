as a result  operating revenue showed a dramatic increase from million in to million in  an increase of 
the local service revenues of its telephone utility subsidiaries from the provision of local telephone services increased by in  due in substantial part to a continued increase in access lines in service 
wireless service revenues generated by cwc from wireless telecommunications services increased by  due to the continued expansion of cwcs customer base resulting from the development and expansion of cwcs wireless infrastructure and marketing facilities 
long distance and access revenues increased in  lead by ccis provision of full long distance service with increased revenues of over million 
cci  as a competitive local exchange carrier clec  expanded local telephone service outside of ctts local exchange service territories into adjacent bell atlantic pennsylvania territories 
in november   the company entered into an agreement to acquire telebeam  inc tlb in state college  pennsylvania  and closed on that acquisition in january  tlb is a data clec company that provides high speed data  long distance voice and cable television 
tlbs revenues are not included in cei consolidated revenues for net income fell to million  or per common share  from net income of million  or per common share  and net income of million  or per common share 
the decline in net income was caused by the impact of the operating expenses of the new businesses of cwc and cci in a very competitive environment  the investment in the infrastructure of cwcs wireless system and ccis clec and long distance systems  losses resulting from ctts unconsolidated partnership interest in penteledata  llp  an internet access provider in which ctt owns a limited partnership interest  pre acquisition costs of the tlb acquisition  and the amortization of the companys investment in the goodwill of bvt and inf 
furthermore  in and the companys net income was increased as the result of one time gains from the sale of its partnership interests in cellular service providers in lancaster and berks counties  pennsylvania 
item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the continued strong operating performance of the companys local networks and related markets provides the company with the financial resources to pursue its strategic plan to become a fully integrated communications provider 
results of operations revenues perating revenues increase in thousands the increase in operating revenues during resulted from increases in all the various operating segments  except other revenues  as explained below 
inf generated million  cwc generated million and cci generated over million in revenues during  compared with million  million and million  respectively  in the to increase of was partially due to the initial inclusion of the revenues of inf  which was acquired in the second quarter of local service revenues increase in thousands local service revenues are generated from the provision of local exchange services  including enhanced services  primarily by the companys operating telephone subsidiaries  ctt and bvt 
enhanced services include caller id  call waiting and return call 
these services are regulated by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc 
the substantial increase in local service revenues in  reflected the continued growth in access lines in service and clec revenues in the amount of million generated by cci 
the number of in service access lines of ctt  bvt  and now cci has increased substantially in recent years 
during  the number of ctts and bvts telephone access lines in service increased  or  to a total of  and ccis clec access lines in service increased by over  to a total of  during the past three years  the installation by residential customers of more than one access line  largely as a result of increasing internet usage  has been a major factor in such increases within the companys franchise territories 
the company anticipates this trend to continue for the next few years 
the company has been aggressively pursuing the strategy of providing clec services in neighboring franchise territories 
in september  ctt and bvt received approval from the puc to rebalance their rates 
the impact of this reduced intrastate access charges  as well as some custom calling feature charges  and increased local service rates in certain areas 
the impact of rebalancing should be revenue neutral 
item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long distance and access service revenues increase in thousands long distance and access service revenues are generated by the telephone companies and cci 
long distance service revenues are derived from customer calls to locations outside of the customers local calling area 
ctt and bvt provide intralata toll services for calls outside of the customers local calling area but within the same local access and transport area 
cci provides intralata and interlata toll services  the latter being for calls outside of the customers local calling area and local access and transport area 
long distance toll service is becoming increasingly competitive 
the pennsylvania public utility commission adopted a regulation  effective january   requiring intralata toll competition within the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
the intralata toll revenues of ctt and bvt have declined as a result of such increased competition 
in late  cci converted to a full service  facilities based interexchange carrier to offer full long distance service  in order to attract new long distance customers  as well as retain its existing customer base 
as a result  its long distance revenues almost doubled to million in and increased in to million 
in contrast  the long distance revenues of ctt and bvt fell or million during as of december   cci had over  long distance customers 
cci is the long distance provider with the second largest number of customers within the franchised territories of ctt and bvt 
access service revenues consist of payments from end user subscribers and long distance carriers to access the companys local exchange facilities to provide long distance services 
total switched access minutes of use on the companys networks increased during intrastate access rates were reduced in we anticipate that access rates will continue to decline as local competition in the telecommunications industry becomes more widespread 
this could negatively impact future access service revenues of ctt and bvt

network operations and cost of sales expenses increased by during the to period partially due to the acquisition of inf and cwcs business development expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increase in thousands depreciation and amortization expenses include charges from all of the subsidiaries 
the increases in and are directly related to the depreciation of the capitalized costs of cwcs pcs network 
the depreciation rates of ctt and bvt deceased slightly in  as the result of a depreciation study

also the acquisition of inf contributed substantially to the increase in the to period 
corporate operations expenses increase in thousands corporate operations expenses include regulatory  executive  and insurance expenses and professional fees  such as fees for legal and accounting services 
these expenses include regulated expenses of ctt and bvt and expenses of cei and the other subsidiaries

corporate operations expenses includes a portion of the acquisition costs of tlb 
the increases in corporate operations expenses during the through period resulted from the inclusion of a full year of infs corporate operations expenses in and expenses incurred by cci and cwc in developing their businesses  especially expenses and fees related to the build out and start up of cwcs pcs system 
corporate operations expenses increased during the through period

the increase in interest from to was caused by interest on the companys borrowing of million to finance the build out of the pcs system 
the company drew on its bank lines of credit for interim financing in  but did not draw thereon in or at the end of  a balance of million remained on its bank lines of credit 
in february   ctt obtained a million unsecured term loan from a bank at an interest rate of to refinance two year unsecured term loans with interest rates at prime with ceilings of and  respectively

item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as projected  net income was negatively impacted by the operating losses of cwc and cci  and the goodwill amortization associated with the acquisitions of bvt and inf 
the company anticipates that net income will be negatively impacted in the near future as a result of i the expenses associated with the continued build out and development of cwcs wireless pcs business  ii the continued amortization of goodwill arising from the acquisitions of bvt and inf  iii the loss of the income of brace and lace  and iv the expansion of  and the build out of  tlbs telecommunications system in state college  pennsylvania  and other areas

financial condition liquidity and capital commitments years ended december  cash flows from used in in thousands operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    the company uses the net cash generated from its operations and from external financing to fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization  and invest in new businesses 
the companys sources of funds  primarily from operations and  to the extent necessary  from readily available external financing arrangements  are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements 
we expect that presently foreseeable capital requirements including the tlb build out of its clec business  along with the expansion of the pcs business into state college  will require additional debt financing in order to maintain our capital structure and ensure our financial flexibility 
on december   the company had commitments totaling million  including commitments to purchase equipment and materials to continue the upgrade of its telecommunications plant base and to build the pcs network 
the company plans to finance its projected capital budget requirements for  including the tlb build out  totaling million  from internally generated funds  and some additional debt financing 
cash flows from operating activities our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations 
taking into account net income plus the various adjustments for depreciation and amortization  the cash flows from operating activities in were million 
although net income for accounting purposes is decreased by the amortization of the goodwill arising from the acquisitions of bvt and inf and the higher item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued depreciation expenses arising from the capital investment in pcs  amortization and depreciation are non cash expenses and  consequently  a source of cash that the company can use for the capital investment necessary to maintain and upgrade its network and build and develop pcs 
cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures are the companys primary use of cash resources 
the companys capital expenditures in included million for the companys local exchange operations and million for the build out and further development of its pcs operation 
the investment in local exchange operations was consistent with the investments made in and the investment in the pcs operation was million in  million in and million in the investments are made to support the companys businesses in order to facilitate the introduction of new products and services  enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges and increase the operating efficiency and productivity of its networks 
the investment in the pcs system is treated by the company as an investment in a new business 
during  the company received proceeds in excess of million from the liquidation of its partnership interest in brace and in received approximately million from the sale of its partnership interest in lace 
in  it also received proceeds totaling  from the sale of equity securities 
substantial amounts of additional capital will be needed for the remaining build out of the pcs network and the build out of the tlb network 
cwcs capital requirements over the next several years to complete the build out of its entire pcs network and the clec network could exceed million 
additional financing could come from internal sources  long term debt  common stock issue  or a combination of the three 
cash flows used in financing activities as in prior years  dividend payments were a significant use of cash 
in the company paid dividends totaling million and  to redeem preferred stock

in september  the company undertook to repurchase up to one hundred thousand shares of common stock on the open market or in negotiated transactions at a maximum price of per share depending on the market conditions and other factors 
as of june   the close of the offer  the company had purchased  common shares at an average price of per share 
some of these shares have been reissued under the companys dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan 
item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as of december   a balance of  of these shares remained in treasury 
equity investments the company has continued to invest in the future of the telecommunications industry through the ownership of the publicly traded stock of other telecommunication companies 
during  the companys total value in this stock increased due to unrealized appreciation 
the current market value of the companys investment stock is million 
management views this investment as a source of future liquidity 
in february   the company sold some of its investment stock for  other factors personal communication services pcs cwc began commercial operations as a provider of wireless telecommunications services in may  by the end of it had base stations in service throughout the reading  sunbury and williamsport areas 
cwc plans to put an additional base stations into service during  to augment coverage in those markets and to start the build out of the state college  pa 
area 
cwc holds licenses to provide wireless services known as personal communication services pcs in radio spectrum in the c and d blocks 
pcs is a wireless communications service based on lower power and a higher frequency bandwidth than cellular service 
pcs is anticipated to be more reliable  of better quality and less expensive for the customer  than cellular 
the basic trading areas in which cwc holds licenses are reading  pottsville  sunbury  williamsport  and state college  pennsylvania  covering ten counties in pennsylvania 
in april cwc was the successful bidder in the federal communications commission c block re auction for additional bandwidth in the basic trading areas bta where the company already held licenses and for bandwidth in the state college bta 
management views participation in pcs as an important part of its future business 
pcs is a reliable  convenient and inexpensive vehicle for providing wireless telephone service 
it will provide the company with an opportunity to expand its business into neighboring territories while maintaining the companys current customer base 
the development of the pcs network and business is subject to the risks and delays associated with the design and construction of the wireless system and the commencement of a new business 
the company has already invested almost million in the pcs network and business and could invest an additional million over the next several years 
the company has projected pcs operating losses for the near future 
the capital cost of the pcs system  the depreciation expense of the pcs assets  and the projected pcs operating losses will significantly impact the companys earnings 
item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effects of substantial indebtedness and preferred stock on future operations at december   the company had approximately million of long term debt outstanding and approximately million of redeemable preferred stock  compared to approximately million of common equity 
this resulted in a ratio of debt and preferred stock to equity 
at december  the ratio was debt to equity 
the decreased debt ratio reflects the required debt redemption in although a higher level of debt and preferred stock is not unusual in the telecommunications industry  the additional debt and preferred stock may have important consequences on the companys future operations  including i the company will incur additional interest expense and significant principal repayment obligations  ii the company is subject to significant unscheduled preferred stock redemption obligations  iii the companys increased leverage may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and iv payment of dividends on the companys common shares may be restricted by the level of financial resources needed to service the companys additional debt and preferred stock 
acquisition of telebeam  incorporated on january   the company acquired telebeam  incorporated  a telecommunications company headquartered in state college  pennsylvania  by merger into a merger subsidiary of the company  the name of which was changed to telebeam  incorporated at the time of the merger 
more information is available in the companys current reports on form k which were filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on february  and november   and the companys registration statement on form s  filed with the sec on december  the telebeam acquisition is likely to have a negative impact on the companys year earnings 
regulated industry ctt and bvt are subject to a rate making process regulated jointly by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc and the federal communications commission fcc called rate of return regulation 
an amendment to the pennsylvania public utility act passed in  provides for streamlined rate regulation and a method for determining rates other than the rate of return regulation and procedures for the state jurisdiction 
this new regulation referred to as chapter  provides a price stability mechanism in which a telephone companys annual revenues from non competitive services may be permitted to change in line with the gross domestic producer price index  minus a productivity offset  with no limitation on earnings by the regulated company 
in order for the company to avail itself of the procedures permitted by chapter  ctt and bvt must commit to providing universal broadband services by both companies filed chapter plans in july and approval is expected in march the telecommunication industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on financial performance 
the federal telecommunications act of  creates a regulatory item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued environment that encourages competition 
as rural companies  ctt and bvt are exempt from many of the most onerous aspects of competition unless prospective competitors can pass a public interest standard and agree to offer service throughout the telephone companies territories 
in addition  in march ctt and bvt received approval by the pennsylvania puc of a petition that has significantly strengthened the companies competitive position relative to non facilities based competition 
however  facilities based competition is not precluded 
management believes that competition will continue to bring many new opportunities for the local exchange companies 
management is endeavoring to position the company to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise and remains optimistic about the future 
during cci significantly grew its long distance business both in the ctt and bvt franchise territories  as well a surrounding areas 
in addition ccis competitive local telephone business became operational in and began offering service in bell atlantics franchise territory 
strong growth in this business segment was experienced in and is expected to continue in accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas the company follows the accounting statement which recognizes the economic effect of rate regulation by recording costs and return on investment as such amounts are recovered through regulatory authorized rates 
as of december   the company had no regulated assets but had regulated liabilities totaling thousand 
the company currently expects to follow the accounting practices prescribed by sfas in the foreseeable future  but  if the company discontinued this practice  the effect of writing off any regulatory assets and liabilities would not be material to the companys operations 
effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating revenues and expenses over the past three years have been immaterial 
management anticipates that this trend will continue in the near future
