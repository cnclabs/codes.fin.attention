the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry and recent financial difficulties of significant menswear retailers may present the company with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than the company s past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
the company may use cash on hand  together with its cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
the company anticipates that its existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its various credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
in connection with the company s direct sourcing program  the company may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the italian lira 
the company generally enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
the majority of the forward exchange contracts are with two financial institutions 
therefore  the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated 
the company may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions

unrealized pretax losses on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at january  and approximately million at january  a hypothetical change in applicable january  forward rates would increase or decrease this pretax loss by approximately million related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of the company s canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of the company s canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
the company is also subject to market risk due to its long term floating rate term loan of million at january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase the company s interest expense and its cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase the company s interest expense and payments by approximately million
