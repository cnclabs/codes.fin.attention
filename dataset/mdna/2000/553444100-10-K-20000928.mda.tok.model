overview current events privatization of company 
on august   we announced that a special committee of our board of directors had reached an agreement in principle with the company s chairman and chief executive officer  monte r 
black  to acquire the company in a cash merger at per share plus an additional amount if the sale of filtration services generated proceeds in excess of targeted amounts 
on september   we announced that mr 
black had withdrawn his previously announced proposal to acquire the company 
mr 
black advised the company s special committee  which had been evaluating the proposal  that he withdrew the proposal primarily because he perceived uncertainty in the company s core businesses due to sluggish customer demand from certain industries 
mr 
black also expected that the higher than anticipated level of current company indebtedness  when added to the debt to be incurred to finance the privatization transaction  would adversely impact the company if the privatization transaction were completed 
in addition  mr 
black advised the special committee that he is not considering a new proposal to acquire the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
operating results for fiscal will be negatively impacted by charges for severance costs related to the resignation of certain officers 
the nature and amount of transaction costs  if any  related to the proposed privatization transaction have not yet been determined 
proposed sale of filtration services 
in connection with the proposed privatization transaction  we also announced our plan to sell filtration services 
even though mr 
black s proposal to acquire the company has been withdrawn  we still intend to sell filtration services 
filtration services provides air and liquid filtration devices  filtration media and consumable products  engineering analysis and industrial cleaning and facility maintenance primarily to the automotive industry 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated to account for filtration services as a discontinued operation for all periods presented therein 
discontinued operations include filtration services net sales that totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively

recapitalization of pentagon 
on july   we closed a transaction related to pentagon pursuant to the recapitalization agreement 
pursuant to the recapitalization agreement  bcp invested in pentagon  we sold a majority of our equity interest in pentagon to bcp and pentagon indebtedness to us was repaid

our fiscal statement of income and the june  balance sheet include a million accrued loss on sale of subsidiary  net of related tax benefits  to reduce our investment in pentagon to of pentagon s equity upon finalization of the recapitalization transaction 
the loss on sale of subsidiary recorded at june  is subject to final due diligence 
as a result of the reduction in our ownership of pentagon s capital stock to  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will record our remaining investment in pentagon under the equity method of accounting 
unusual events in fiscal in late june through july  general motors experienced a strike  which affected our operations primarily at our industrial container cleaning service line 
in march  we experienced a fire at our austin  texas facility 
this facility provided critical parts cleaning within pentagon 
the fire caused the facility  and most equipment within the facility  to be unusable 
a portion of the business from this facility was temporarily transferred to our hopewell junction  new york facility and the remainder was temporarily lost to other service providers 
we obtained a new site in austin to replace the damaged facility and completed construction in august the new facility was ramped up to pre fire business levels during the second quarter of fiscal acquisitions 
since june  we have acquired businesses that represent an aggregate increase in our revenues of approximately million 
we agreed to pay an aggregate consideration for these businesses of approximately million  which included cash  common stock  preferred stock of pentagon and contingent consideration for future performance 
we accounted for each of these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and each are included in our results of operations only from the effective date of acquisition 
certain of the acquisitions related to our entry in late into a new service line that provides contamination control services for critical cleanroom environments 
these companies were combined into a single subsidiary of the company  pentagon 
in july  we sold a majority of our equity interest in pentagon and retained a interest in the capital stock of pentagon

provisions for income taxes 
prior to october   mpw industrial services  inc was an s corporation for income tax purposes and did not record a provision for federal and some state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal and in the pro forma information for fiscal reflects an effective rate of 
quarterly results and seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the least amount of revenues generated in the third quarter  higher revenues in the second quarter and the greatest amount of revenues in the first and fourth quarters 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors over which we have no control  including our customers budgetary constraints  the timing and duration of our customers planned maintenance activities and shutdowns  changes in our competitors pricing policies and general economic conditions 
also  some operating and fixed costs remain relatively constant throughout the fiscal year that  when offset by differing levels of revenues  may result in fluctuations in quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of million 
during fiscal  we had million provided by operating activities and made capital investments of million 
during fiscal  we completed two acquisitions that required an aggregate of million in cash  net of cash received  and the issuance of an unsecured convertible subordinated promissory note with a principal amount of million  which was convertible into shares of common stock of mpw 
in connection with the recapitalization of pentagon noted above  this note was paid off in full  with accrued interest  in july in addition  we paid additional consideration of million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock in connection with several of our acquisition agreements that provide for additional consideration to be paid based on achievement of certain objectives 
the borrowings under our revolving credit facility reached million as of june  during october  we entered into our current credit facility with our principal banks and two additional banks 
the current credit facility  as amended  provides us with up to million of revolving credit availability for a three year period  subject to extension by the banks each year on the anniversary of the agreement 
under the terms of our current credit facility  the entire million is available for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
borrowings under our current credit facility is at rates  based on the prime or eurodollar rate  that we believe to be very favorable 
availability of borrowings is subject to the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth  certain levels of interest coverage and maintenance of a specific ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization that we believe will not affect the availability of borrowings under our current credit facility 
the current credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the terms of the current credit facility include a mechanism that allows us  with the approval of the banks  to increase the capacity under the credit agreement up to million 
subsequent to june   we received million in conjunction with the recapitalization of pentagon noted above and used those proceeds to repay debt 
after this repayment  our cost of borrowing under the credit facility was reduced by approximately fifty basis points 
we also paid additional consideration of million in cash in connection with several of our acquisition agreements that provide for additional consideration to be paid based on achievement of certain objectives 
our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility are approximately million 
inflation the effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we had a balance of million on our revolving credit facility at june   which is subject to a variable rate of interest based on the prime or eurodollar rate 
assuming borrowings at june   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year
