item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis by the company s management should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
results of operations comparison of fiscal with fiscal three non recurring events materially affected our financial performance discussed below 
on february   we sold substantially all of the net assets of our high performance plastics segment to spartech 
that segment accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenues and of our fiscal net income 
on may   we acquired sterling semiconductor  inc this acquisition expanded our commitment to the compound semiconductor business 
finally  in fiscal the effects of the sale of the automotive portion of the coated fabrics segment were fully realized 
the runoff revenues from that operation of million in fiscal declined to  in fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased in fiscal by approximately to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the sale of the automotive operations of the coated fabrics segment in fiscal and the gradual phase out of those operations 
excluding automotive sales from both periods  sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase  excluding automotive sales from both periods  was due to an increase in sales from the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment and the inclusion of fifty three weeks in fiscal versus fifty two weeks in fiscal the coated fabrics segment s net sales decreased approximately in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in automotive sales due to the gradual phase out of its automotive operations 
automotive sales approximated  during fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal excluding automotive sales from both periods  sales of naugahyde r vinyl coated fabrics increased approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in unit volume and selling prices and the inclusion of fifty three weeks in fiscal versus fifty two weeks in fiscal net sales by the specialty adhesives segment increased in fiscal by approximately to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of its branded industrial adhesives and sealant products and the inclusion of fifty three weeks in fiscal versus fifty two weeks in fiscal net sales by the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment for fiscal were million compared to  in fiscal the increase is attributable to the acquisition of sterling in fiscal and net sales from sterling of approximately million  as well as an increase in the sales at the joint venture 
the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment began limited commercial sales and production in fiscal but is still in the development stage 
loss income before interest  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations 
loss before interest  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations for fiscal was million  compared to a loss of million for fiscal the greater loss is due to the net effect of a number of non recurring and unusual items including o the gain realized on the sale of the investment in the preferred stock of emcore corporation million  o the write off of a note receivable and related accrued interest related to the sale of the ensolite closed cell foam division  due to the deterioration of the financial condition of the buyer rbx group  inc as a result of a prolonged strike at its major facility and the ultimate settlement of the note with rbx group  inc million  o a reduction in the fair value of certain property  plant and equipment related to the company s port clinton  ohio facility which is expected to be disposed of in fiscal million  o payments made in connection with the sale of the net assets of the high performance plastics segment  including incentive payments and benefit costs to and for officers and directors related to the achievement of certain strategic initiatives million and a special contribution of company stock to the k plan for incentives to retain key personnel million  o the write down of a technology license of million related to the future transfer of technology for high brightness light emitting diodes hb leds from emcore corporation  the company has added highly qualified scientists to internally advance and develop certain technology for hb leds  o the write off of acquired in process research and development ipr d of million related to the acquisition of sterling on may  see item business recent developments  o a reduction of revenues associated with the gradual phase out of the automotive operations of the coated fabrics segment  and o start up losses for the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment 
also during fiscal  there were no corporate allocations to the discontinued operations of the high performance plastics segment 
the corporate allocations for fiscal were million 
the coated fabrics segment s loss before interest  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations in fiscal was  compared to income of million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to the loss of revenues from the gradual phase out of its automotive operations  as well as certain incremental costs related to the closure of the port clinton  ohio facility previously used to produce automotive products  the write down to fair value of certain machinery and equipment to be disposed of at the port clinton  ohio facility of approximately  and a special contribution to the k plan for eligible participants of the coated fabrics segment of approximately  the specialty adhesives segment s income before interest  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations in fiscal and fiscal was in fiscal  a special contribution to the k plan for eligible participants of the specialty adhesives segment of  was substantially offset by the increase in sales volume of branded industrial products 
the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment s loss before interest  income taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations in fiscal was million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the losses relate to the start up and training costs of the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment and a special contribution to the k plan for eligible participants of the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment of approximately  also contributing to the increase in loss is a charge of million related to acquired ipr d and goodwill and intangible amortization of million during fiscal attributable to the purchase of certain assets of sterling which were acquired by the company on may  the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of approximately million are being amortized over five years 
the identifiable intangible assets and ipr d of sterling were valued on the acquisition date using an income approach and  in the case of the trained workforce intangible asset  a cost to replicate approach 
in the income approach  a cash flow was developed associated with the respective asset after charges for the use of existing assets as applicable and consideration of the economic life of the asset reflected by the obsolescence factor 
the income stream was discounted to its present value based upon the estimated discount rate 
the discount rate was based upon our required rate of return  useful life of the technology and risks associated with the timely completion of the product lines 
in the case of ipr d  the exclusionary rule was applied by which the indicated value was multiplied by the estimate of the percentage of the total technology that was complete as of the valuation date 
percentage of completion was determined based upon the relative number of critical issues solved to the total number of critical issues identified 
significant appraisal assumptions include revenue projections  margins and expense levels and the risk adjusted discount rate applied to the project s expected cash flows 
as of the acquisition date  sterling had developed a commercial production capability for inch h and h measures of hardness sic wafers 
sterling was also engaged in concurrent efforts to develop potential product lines for large diameter inch and inch h and h wafers  semi insulating wafers  epitaxial coatings and device designs that would produce an economical device die for discrete semiconductor devices 
the purchased ipr d is summarized as follows in thousands ipr d technology discount economic percent expected date for full description rate life complete fair value commercial viability and large diameter sic wafers years semi insulating wafers years epitaxy coatings years devices years  total ipr d  the cost to complete all projects approximates million 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired ipr d into technologically feasible and commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  design and testing activities necessary to establish a product that can be produced to meet its design requirements including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the company currently expects the acquired ipr d will be successfully developed but there can be no assurance the technological feasibility or commercial viability of these products will be achieved 
if none of these products are successfully developed  the company s sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
approximately million of net costs  non recurring and unusual items recorded in fiscal were not allocated to any business segment compared to million of unallocated costs for fiscal included in the non allocated items in fiscal are the following o gain realized on the sale of the investment in the preferred stock of emcore corporation million  o the write off of the rbx group  inc note and related accrued interest million  o a reduction in the fair value of real property related to the company s port clinton  ohio facility which is expected to be disposed of this year million  o incentive payments and benefit costs to and for officers and directors related to the achievement of certain strategic initiatives million  o the write down of a technology license of million related to the future transfer of technology for high brightness light emitting diodes hb leds from emcore corporation the company has added highly qualified scientists to internally develop and advance the technology for hb leds  and o a special contribution of company stock to eligible participants of the corporate office of approximately  for the k plan 
also during fiscal  there were no corporate allocations to the discontinued operations of the high performance plastics segment 
prior year corporate allocations for fiscal were million 
interest income expense 
interest income for fiscal was million compared to  in fiscal the increase is attributable to interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds received from the sale of the company s high performance plastics segment on february  interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to a lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  approximately  of interest was capitalized related to the build out of the optoelectronics facility in tampa  florida  versus approximately  in fiscal income tax benefit 
income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the provisions for income tax benefit were calculated through the use of the estimated income tax rates based upon annualized income 
fiscal benefited from the reversal of million of deferred tax valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards 
the reversal was due to the use of the capital losses to offset capital gains resulting from the sale of the preferred stock of emcore corporation and the sale of the high performance plastics segment 
discontinued operations 
net income from discontinued operations of the high performance plastics segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is attributable to the net effect of the gain recognized on the february  sale of the high performance plastics segment of approximately million net of taxes of approximately million and operating income for the period september  to february  the decline in operations is primarily a result of production inefficiencies at the stamford  connecticut facility due to a major plant modernization and only five months of operations in fiscal versus twelve months of operations in fiscal the decline in operations was partially offset by the suspension of a corporate allocation to this segment in fiscal comparison of fiscal with fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales decreased approximately in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the sale of the automotive operations of the coated fabrics segment in fiscal and the gradual phase out of those operations 
excluding automotive operations from both periods  sales increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal the coated fabrics segment s net sales decreased approximately in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from a decline in automotive sales due to the gradual phase out of its automotive operations 
automotive sales approximated million during fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal excluding automotive sales from both periods  sales of naugahyde r vinyl coated fabrics increased approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in unit volume and selling prices 
net sales in the specialty adhesives segment increased in fiscal by approximately to million from million in fiscal this increase in sales is primarily attributable to a strong demand for roofing adhesives and sealants and increased sales as a result of a tolling agreement with a major adhesives company 
net sales in the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment were  during fiscal the segment is in the developmental stage 
inventory was provided to the segment under a supply agreement with the segment s joint venture partner 
the segment did not have sales during fiscal loss income before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item 
in fiscal  the company had loss before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item of million as compared to income before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item of million for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a loss of revenues associated with the gradual phase out of the automotive operations of the coated fabrics segment and start up costs for the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment 
the coated fabrics segment s income before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item in fiscal was approximately million compared to income before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item of million in fiscal the decrease of million was principally due to the loss of revenues from the gradual phase out of its automotive operations  as well as certain incremental costs related to the closure of the port clinton  ohio facility used to produce automotive products 
income before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item for the specialty adhesives segment increased approximately to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily a result of increased sales volume 
loss before interest  income taxes  minority interest  discontinued operations and extraordinary item for the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment was million in fiscal compared to a loss of  in fiscal the loss is attributable to start up expenses incurred by the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment 
approximately million of miscellaneous expense in fiscal was not allocated to any segment of the company s business compared to million in fiscal interest income expense 
interest income in fiscal approximated  versus  in fiscal the decrease is attributable to reduction of cash balances available for investment in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease is due to an increase in capitalized interest in fiscal  compared to no capitalized interest in fiscal and an overall reduction in interest cost as a result of a fiscal debt refinancing 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit in fiscal was approximately million compared to income tax expense of approximately million in fiscal the provisions for income tax benefit expense were calculated by the company through use of the effective income tax rates based upon its actual loss income 
the fiscal tax benefit included approximately million due to a tax benefit recognized through the carryback effect of a fiscal capital loss 
discontinued operations 
net income from discontinued operations of the high performance plastics segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due to production inefficiencies as a result of a major plant consolidation at the polycast acrylic division as well as reduced sales volume for both royalite thermoplastic products and polycast acrylic products 
extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt 
the extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt during fiscal was million 
this amount represents the loss recognized when the company early retired the remaining million of its senior secured notes  including a call premium payment of and write off of applicable debt issuance cost and unamortized debt discount  net of income tax benefit of approximately million 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal  continuing operations provided million of cash as compared to million provided by continuing operations during fiscal the increase in cash provided by continuing operations for fiscal resulted primarily from the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the sterling acquisition and the commencement of depreciation at the optoelectronics joint venture  and an increase in certain accrued and other expenses in connection with a special contribution to the company s k plan and special incentive costs awarded to officers and other liabilities recorded in connection with the high performance plastics segment sale 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used in investing activities during fiscal significant cash provided by investing activities during fiscal included net cash proceeds from the sale of the high performance plastics segment of million  the sale of the remaining emcore corporation preferred stock for million  net of certain transaction costs  and was offset by the net effect of debt securities purchased and sold 
during fiscal  the purchase of machinery and equipment of approximately million primarily related to the new optoelectronics production facility in tampa  florida and the modernization of the high performance plastics polycast production facility in stamford  connecticut net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was million as compared to million of cash used during fiscal the primary use of cash in financing activities during fiscal was to repay million of outstanding term and revolving credit borrowings to a syndicate headed by fleet national bank as a result of the sale of the high performance plastics segment 
cash of approximately million was also used to purchase the company s common stock for treasury 
on october   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to approximately million at september  working capital at october  was million compared to a working capital deficiency of million at september  on october   the company had outstanding borrowings of million under its  revolving credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc subject to a borrowing base limitation of approximately million at october  
the principal uses of cash during fiscal were to repay debt  repurchase shares in the open market and fund capital expenditures and operating losses at the new optoelectronics facility in tampa  florida 
the company plans to spend an additional million on capital expenditures for the compound semiconductor and optoelectronics segment over the next three years for expansion 
the company plans to fund these expenditures with the proceeds from the sale of the high performance plastics segment and or additional financing as needed 
the company believes that cash from its operations  its ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility mentioned above and proceeds from the sale of the high performance plastics segment will provide sufficient liquidity to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operations together with amounts available under the revolving credit facilities will continue to be sufficient to finance its existing level of operations and meet its debt service obligations 
the company s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations depends on its future performance  which in turn  is subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing including equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such refinancing or additional financing 
effects of inflation the markets in which the company sells products are competitive 
thus  in an inflationary environment the company might not in all instances be able to pass through to consumers general price increases  in which event the company s operations may be materially impacted if such conditions were to occur 
the company has not in the past been adversely impacted by general price inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in short term interest rates primarily as a result of our cash  investing and borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund working capital requirements 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on our floating rate revolving credit advances and investment portfolio 
our risk management policy included the use of derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure on long term variable rate debt 
the counter parties were major financial institutions 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during fiscal  we liquidated all of our interest rate swap instruments for cash proceeds and a gain of  which is included in the income of discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements 
at october   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and investments subject to variable short term interest rates 
on the same date we had a million floating rate revolving credit advance 
because of the short term nature or floating rates  interest changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows assuming other factors are held constant 
based upon the net balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in net interest income of approximately  on an annual basis 
at september   approximately million of our floating rate long term debt and revolving credit advances were not covered under an interest rate swap agreement 
based upon this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
the changes in the composition and balances of items subject to interest rate risk from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to the spartech sale 
the proceeds from the spartech sale were used to repay outstanding debt with the balance invested primarily in debt securities
