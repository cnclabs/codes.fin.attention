   income tax expense    income before extraordinary item    extraordinary item for early extinguishment of debt   net income    fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  which is a increase 
this increase is attributable primarily to internal growth in existing operations and prior year acquisitions 
direct costs primarily include consultant costs and reimbursable project expenses 
direct costs were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal this increase as a percent of revenues is due to the company s increased use of consultants to meet project requirements partially due to the extensive use of consultants by certain companies acquired since november  resulting in only a partial year of such expenses reflected in the april  financial statements  as well as the tight labor market 
management believes that this trend may continue which will cause direct costs as a percentage of revenues to increase in future periods 
direct labor cost was million  or of net production income  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net production income  in fiscal although the volume of architecture  planning and engineering services has increased  it is offset by a an increase in salary and salary related costs which has not been passed through to the company s clients in all cases and b a reduction in certain higher margin projects 
operating costs were million  or of net production income  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net production income  in fiscal operating costs as a percentage of net production income has been negatively impacted in the current period by a an increase in indirect labor as a result of a slowdown in work in november and december imposed by several commercial clients while they concentrated on yk issues and winter storms across the country that closed several offices  b an increase in education and seminars due to the company s increased focus on training and education of its employees  and c an increase in depreciation expense due to the company s increased focus on improvement of certain computer and related equipment 
conversely  operating costs as a percentage of net production income was positively impacted in fiscal by a decrease in certain recurring expenses relating to the company s obligations as a public company as well as the company s internally performing several functions that have previously been outsourced 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to goodwill amortization expense arising from the acquisition of jpj and gaih in october and january  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase is principally due to the company s increase in borrowings on its line of credit as well as debt resulting from the acquisitions of jpj  gaih and ess 
income tax expense was million for both fiscal and fiscal the effective income tax rate was for both fiscal and fiscal this effective tax rate has been impacted by reduction in the effect of state income taxes  which is offset by an increase in the effective tax rate due to increased goodwill amortization 
extraordinary item for early extinguishment of debt was million in fiscal in february  the early extinguishment of indebtedness to first charter national bank first charter and berthel fisher company financial services  inc berthel fisher resulted in an extraordinary charge of  net of income taxes of  that consisted of write off of related unamortized financing costs and other related costs 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  which is a increase 
this increase is attributable primarily to the acquisition of jpj in october this increase is partially offset by the company s change in its fiscal year end date from the last friday in april to the friday nearest the end of april 
this change resulted in one week less revenues for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year direct costs primarily include consultant costs and reimbursable project expenses 
direct costs were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal this increase as a percent of revenues is due to the company s increased use of consultant expenses to meet project requirements 
the increase is primarily due to jpj s use of consultants in the period from november to april management believes that jpj will continue to use consultants which will cause direct costs as a percent of revenues to increase in future periods as jpj consultant expenses are reflected for a twelve month period 
direct labor cost was million  or of net production income  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net production income  in fiscal this decrease as a percent of net production income is principally due to continued improvement in productivity as a result of the company s increased focus on cost containment for each project 
operating costs were million  or of net production income  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net production income  in fiscal this increase as a percent of net production income is principally due to expenses associated with being a public company and depreciation and amortization expenses associated with property and equipment  partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase is attributable to amortization expense arising from the acquisition of jpj and gaih in october and january  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal this decrease is principally due to the company s offering in june whereby the company repaid approximately million in debt from the proceeds of the offering 
this decrease is partially offset by increased borrowings in the last six months of fiscal as a result of the company s acquisition of jpj and gaih in october and january  respectively 
income tax expense was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective rate is higher primarily due to increased goodwill amortization 
extraordinary item for early extinguishment of debt was million in fiscal in june  the early extinguishment of indebtedness to pacific  equitas  lp and berthel fisher resulted in an extraordinary charge of  net of income taxes of  that consisted of write off of related unamortized financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources at april   the company s current assets of million exceeded current liabilities of million resulting in working capital of million 
during the year ended april   the company used million in cash from operating activities  primarily related to the increase in trade and other receivables  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  prepaid expenses and other assets  and decreases in accrued expenses that were partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
the company used million for investing activities  the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of ess  net of cash acquired 
on september   the company purchased all the issued and outstanding stock of ess for a combination of cash and promissory notes for a total of  the company generated million from financing activities  primarily from borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term notes payable completed in february with ibj whitehall business credit corporation ibj 
a portion of these borrowings were used to repay the company s existing line of credit with first charter which matured on june  as well as the equipment lease with berthel fisher 
the company s growth and operating strategy will require substantial capital and may result in the company incurring additional debt  issuing equity securities or obtaining additional bank financing 
as the management company  the company will be responsible for the financing of working capital growth  capital growth and other cash needs of the managed firms 
see business hlm design operations management and services agreements 
on february   the company entered into a revolving credit  term loan and capital expenditure loan for a total of  with ibj 
the three financing arrangements are discussed below a 
revolving credit the maximum revolving advance amount is  the amount available to borrow is calculated based on the aging of certain assets 
this loan matures in february this revolving credit facility bears interest at the sum of the eurodollar rate plus 
a portion of the revolver was used to repay the first charter revolver of  and note payable of  at april   the company had  outstanding bearing interest at 
b 
term loan the amount of the loan is  this loan matures in february and bears interest at a maximum of prime plus 
a portion of the proceeds from this term loan was used to repay  in indebtedness to berthel fisher 
at april   the interest rate was 
c 
capital expenditure loan the maximum capital expenditure amount is  the amount is available for the financing of equipment used in the company s business 
this loan matures in february and bears interest at a maximum of prime plus 
at april   there were no borrowings under this loan 
substantially all assets are pledged under this financing arrangement 
this financing arrangement requires certain financial requirements be maintained such as minimum net worth  maximum leverage and senior leverage ratios  maximum fixed charge coverage and senior fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum capital expenditure commitments 
at april   the company was in compliance with these financial requirements 
in the fourth quarter  the early extinguishment of the berthel fisher and the first charter debt noted above resulted in an extraordinary charge of  net of income taxes of  that consisted of write off of related unamortized financing costs 
the company believes that for present operations  the existing line of credit and anticipated funds from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  in order to continue its expansion program through acquisitions  the company will require additional capital 
if the company is unable to obtain additional capital  its ability to implement its growth strategy will be adversely affected 
the company s operations are professional services and as such are not capital intensive 
however  in order to enhance productivity  the company has increased its purchase of computer hardware and software 
the company currently has no material commitments for purchases of additional equipment 
capital expenditures during fiscal were million 
seasonality the company s operations are not seasonal in nature 
effects of inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation in fiscal years  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for those periods 
year compliance prior to december   the company had instituted a comprehensive year review for compliance both internal and with all key vendors and suppliers 
the transition to year resulted in no significant disruptions to the company s operations 
since many of the company s information technology purchases were made after january  the company s computer systems were year compliant 
no significant expenditures were incurred as a result of year issues 
significant materiality of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets acquired 
the cumulative amount of goodwill at april  was million and at april  was million 
as a percentage of total assets and stockholders equity  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  represented and  respectively  at april   and and  respectively  at april  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that goodwill and all other intangible assets be amortized over the period benefited 
we have determined that the period benefited by the goodwill will be no less than years 
accordingly  we are amortizing goodwill over a year period for hlmna and a year period for both jpj and gaih 
earnings reported in periods immediately following an acquisition would be overstated if the company attributed a or year benefit to an intangible asset that should have had a shorter benefit period 
in later years  the company would be burdened by a continuing charge against earnings without the associated benefit to income valued by management in arriving at the price paid for the businesses acquired 
earnings in later years also could be significantly affected if management then determined that the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired 
we periodically compare the carrying value of goodwill with the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the businesses we have acquired in order to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill 
we have concluded that the anticipated future cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in our acquisitions will continue indefinitely and there is no persuasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate over a period shorter than and years  respectively 
we expect to incur additional goodwill in future acquisitions 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities 
this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement will become effective for the company beginning april the company is currently calculating the effects of sfas no 
on the company s financial statements and current disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  the company has in place a  revolving credit facility  which bears interest at the eurodollar rate plus 
at april   the company had borrowings under this revolving credit facility of  and the effective interest rate at that date was 
in addition  the company has a  note payable due in monthly installments of  plus interest at a maximum of prime plus at april  as well as a  capital expenditure loan bearing interest at prime plus which had no borrowings outstanding at april  while changes in the prime rate could affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future  the company believes the effect  if any  of reasonably foreseeable near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
the company has no other material exposure to market risk sensitive instruments
