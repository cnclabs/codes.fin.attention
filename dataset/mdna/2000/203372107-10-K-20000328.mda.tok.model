item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company background commscope  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  operates in the cable manufacturing business 
we are a leading worldwide designer  manufacturer and marketer of a broad line of coaxial cables and other high performance electronic and fiber optic cable products for cable television  telephony  internet access and wireless communications 
we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of coaxial cable for hybrid fiber coaxial hfc cable television systems 
we are also a leading supplier of coaxial  twisted pair and fiber optic cables for premise wiring local area networks  wireless and other communication applications 
commscope  inc was incorporated in delaware in january on july   through a series of transactions and stockholder dividends initiated by general instrument corporation general instrument i commscope  inc of north carolina commscope nc  formerly a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of general instrument  became a wholly owned subsidiary of commscope  inc and ii commscope  inc 
was spun off to the stockholders of general instrument 
general instrument retained no ownership interest in commscope  inc or commscope nc 
commscope  inc 
commenced operations as an independent entity with publicly traded common stock on july  our consolidated financial statements for the period prior to the spin off reflect our results of operations and cash flows that were included in the consolidated financial statements of general instrument 
these financial results include the revenues and expenses directly attributable to our operations and an allocation of certain general corporate and administrative expenses and net interest expense from general instrument 
we believe the assumptions underlying these financial statements are reasonable  although these financial statements may not necessarily reflect the results of operations had we been a separate  stand alone entity 
financial highlights for the three year period  we reported the following results year ended december  a net income    net income per share assuming dilution a net income and net income per share information for are presented on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the spin off on july  one time events during include an after tax profit of million related to the sale of certain real and personal property and inventories of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business and an after tax benefit of million related to the partial reversal of after tax charges associated with our closed australian joint venture 
net income for  excluding these one time events would have been million  or per basic and diluted share 
one time events during include an after tax charge of million associated with the closing of the australian joint venture 
net income for  excluding this one time event  would have been million  or per basic and diluted share 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included in item  should be read as an integral part of the financial highlights and the following financial review 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from the increase in net sales is primarily driven by strong broadband cable sales to domestic telecommunications companies and solid growth in all key product categories 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by product line as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and net of net of sales net sales sales net sales catv video products lan products wireless other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales for the year ended december   international sales increased compared to  due mainly to the acquisition of our new coaxial cable business in seneffe  belgium and improving sales in the asia pacific rim region 
while year to date latin american sales were level from to  we are beginning to see encouraging signs of activity in this region  demonstrated by three recently announced contracts representing more than million in potential revenues over the next few years 
net sales to cable television and other video distribution markets catv video products for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from the increase in sales of catv video products resulted primarily from strong sales of broadband cable to domestic telecommunications companies and cable television system operators 
domestic catv video sales grew approximately year over year 
this performance reflects the ongoing momentum in the upgrade of broadband networks for multi channel video  voice and high speed internet access 
net sales for local area network and other data applications lan products for the year ended december  increased million or to million  from demand remains strong for high performance products and pricing for selected products appears to have stabilized 
however  during  capacity constraints limited growth in sales of certain lan products 
during the second half of  we expanded our production capacity for enhanced bandwidth cables and began a  square foot expansion of our claremont  nc facility  in part to support sales growth in lan products 
we expect to equip this expansion in midyear we are optimistic about growth in sales of our lan products  due primarily to the strength of the underlying market  the ongoing shift to high performance products  and the acceptance of our isolite tm foamed insulation for unshielded twisted pair cables 
net sales for wireless and other telecommunications products for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this substantial year over year increase reflects strong growth in both sales of cell reach r for wireless applications and sales of other telecommunications products 
sales of cell reach products more than quadrupled year over year 
we believe that cell reach is now recognized as the new standard of performance and value in the wireless industry due to its superior performance and compelling value proposition for the growing wireless industry 
with significant capacity scheduled to come on line in midyear  we believe that cell reach will be a substantial contributor to our long term growth goals 
other telecommunications products primarily represent cables designed for switching and transmission applications for enhanced telecommunications services 
sales of other telecommunications products more than doubled year over year 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for  an increase of 
gross profit margins improved to for the year ended december   compared to gross profit margins of for the primary drivers of the improvement in gross profit and gross profit margins are o increased sales volumes and favorable product mix  o improving cell reach profitability  and o aggressive cost reduction efforts  primarily through engineered manufacturing efficiencies including vertical integration projects 
these improvements were somewhat offset by lower prices for certain lan products and the acquisition of the seneffe facility 
this facility  while profitable and improving  currently has lower than our average margins 
the seneffe facility is expected to play a key role in strengthening our worldwide delivery capability 
we expect to continue investing in this facility and intend to increase its capacity and productivity 
in order to mitigate escalating material costs  we recently announced global price increases of for all of our hybrid fiber coaxial hfc related products 
we began notifying customers of this price increase in late december and began implementing the increase in february we anticipate continued improvement in gross profit margins due to ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
however  these improvements may be moderated by increasing commodity prices 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was for the years ended december  and the absolute amount of sg a expense increased over the prior period as a result of the expansion of sales and marketing efforts to support developing products and sales growth targets 
research and development research and development expense as a percentage of net sales remained steady at for the years ended december  and we have ongoing programs to develop new products and market opportunities for our products and core capabilities and new manufacturing technologies to achieve cost reductions 
gain on sale of assets in february  we sold certain real and personal property and inventories of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business to alcatel na cable systems  inc for an adjusted price of million 
we recognized a pretax gain from the sale of million or per basic and diluted share  net of tax effect 
other income expense  net in december  we recorded a pretax benefit of million  or per basic and diluted share  net of tax effect  related to the partial reversal of after tax charges associated with our closed australian joint venture 
net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the decrease in net interest costs is primarily due to the lower amount of weighted average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement during in addition  all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement were repaid in december with proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes  which carry a lower effective interest rate 
this reduction in interest expense was partially offset during the year ended december  by interest expense on new borrowings of million euros equivalent to million at the date of borrowing  which are discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for this fluctuation in our effective tax rate is partly due to the strength in domestic versus international sales  which diluted the impact of our foreign sales corporation tax benefit 
in addition  the rate included a benefit of from the reversal of a valuation allowance established in for charges associated with the closing of our australian joint venture 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the following table presents in millions our revenues by product line as well as domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and net of net of sales net sales sales net sales catv video products lan products wireless and other telecom products total worldwide sales domestic sales international sales total worldwide sales international sales of which over are for catv video products decreased  or million  in from international sales of million 
sales to latin america and the pacific rim were affected due to the economic turmoil experienced in those regions during sales to the pacific rim were also negatively affected by decreased sales activity in australia million in compared to million in overall sales of catv video products in decreased by compared to sales of catv video products represented of our net sales in  compared to in domestically  sales of catv video products increased by  driven primarily by increased sales to multiple system operators using hfc cable networks  who continued their system upgrading activities 
to complement our offering of catv video products  we continue to focus on growth opportunities for lan products 
as a leader in the concept of high performance premise wiring cable  sales of lan products grew from approximately million in to million in  before decreasing in to million 
although the sales of enhanced cable continued to be strong  many of the distributors of generic cable had unanticipated high inventory levels late in resulting in reduced sales to those distributors 
many of our lan products utilize the raw material fep to produce flame retarding cables 
there are few worldwide producers of fep and market supplies of this product have been periodically limited over the past several years 
in  we announced that we had developed a thin wall foam fep process  which was patented in  that is designed to use approximately less fep in typical product designs and improve signal velocity 
customer response to initial use of the new products has been positive 
overall average selling prices for catv video products for the full fiscal year decreased slightly from  but were generally more stable than in recent years 
overall average selling prices for lan products were stable for as compared to  primarily due to a stronger mix of enhanced cables  which provide higher unit prices than standard grade cables 
however  overall average selling prices for lan products were lower during the second half of sales of wireless and other telecommunications products increased by million in compared to included in these amounts are sales of wiring products used in telecommunication applications  cell reach product sales  and sales from the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business which was sold in february 
we have expanded into additional markets through the internal development of new products such as cell reach  which is a coaxial cable product designed to be installed on antenna towers for cellular telephone  personal communication services pcs  paging and other wireless or cellular communications applications 
initial marketing of cell reach cables and accessories as the lowest loss  lowest life cycle cost solution for wireless applications to cellular network operators in the united states and certain international markets began in sales of cell reach products represented approximately of total net sales in contracts with airgate wireless and sprint pcs  announced late in  confirm that the cell reach product is gaining industry recognition in the wireless and cellular market 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of million  or 
gross profit margin was in and the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the lower sales volume in as compared to gross profit margin  while stable on a year to year basis  improved significantly throughout gross profit margins were for the first quarter of  for the second quarter of  for the third quarter of and for the fourth quarter of the gross profit margin improvement of almost basis points during the last three calendar quarters of is due primarily to the following factors o a stabilization of market prices for our coaxial cable products  o engineered manufacturing efficiencies including vertical integration projects  o raw material cost improvements including costs for commodity raw materials  and o improving cell reach product profitability 
we have focused on developing or acquiring manufacturing capabilities that allow for the in house production or modification of materials and components used in the production of our finished products that are more efficient than commercially practiced 
our cell reach product generated negative gross profit margin during initial marketing and test installations in for  cell reach manufacturing start up costs negatively affected gross profit margin by approximately basis points 
as cell reach gained industry recognition during  product sales increased and the product produced positive gross profit margin in selling  general and administrative sg a expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the comparable prior year period  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was in and in the increase in the absolute amount of sg a expense was due primarily to expanded sales and marketing efforts for our products 
research and development research and development expense was of net sales in both and gain on sale of assets in february  we sold certain real and personal property and inventories of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business to alcatel na cable systems  inc for an adjusted price of million 
we recognized a pretax gain from the sale of million or per basic and diluted share  net of tax effect 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in includes a million pretax benefit for the partial reversal of pretax charges related to our financial investment in an australian joint venture 
other income expense  net in primarily reflects pretax charges of million to reduce our total current financial investment in an australian joint venture to expected net realizable value 
due to certain governmental regulation changes and other events affecting the market for cable products in australia during  manufacturing operations of the joint venture were suspended in august and formally discontinued by decision of the joint venture s directors in december during the fourth quarter of  we recorded pretax charges of million to other income expense  net to reduce our total current financial investment in the joint venture to expected net realizable value 
tax benefits were recorded at our effective tax rate reduced by a million valuation allowance established for expected nondeductible capital losses resulting from the investment 
net of tax benefits of million  these charges reduced net income by million  or per basic and diluted share 
in july  a formal termination and dissolution agreement for the joint venture was completed 
the partial liquidation of the joint venture s assets in  which was affected by the terms of the formal termination and dissolution agreement between the partners  indicated that the financial position of the joint venture at final dissolution would be better than was anticipated at december  accordingly  million of the pretax charges related to our financial investment in the joint venture were reversed into other income expense  net  representing per basic and diluted share after taxes  including reversal of the capital loss valuation allowance established in final dissolution and liquidation of this joint venture is expected to be completed in accordance with australian legal requirements in and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in compared to million in on a pro forma basis giving effect to the spin off as if it had occurred on january   net interest expense was million in the reduction in net interest expense in compared to pro forma net interest expense in was primarily attributable to an million reduction in borrowings under our revolving credit facility in and a total reduction of million from the date of the spin off to december  
income taxes our effective tax rate in was representing a normal effective tax rate reduced primarily by the effects of the change in a capital loss valuation allowance of 
our effective tax rate in was representing a normal effective tax rate increased by for the establishment of a capital loss valuation allowance 
the capital loss valuation allowance established in relates to expected nondeductible capital losses resulting from our equity investment in the australian joint venture 
the basis point reduction in the normal effective tax rate for compared to was mainly due to increased tax benefits from foreign sales and the utilization of state investment tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in cash flow provided by operations in  compared to  is primarily due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher sales volume and moderated somewhat by improved cash collections 
this decrease was also somewhat offset by an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  we believe that working capital levels are appropriate to support current levels of orders and backlog 
during the year ended december   we invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in the capital spending in each period was primarily attributable to vertical integration projects  capacity expansion  and equipment upgrades to meet increased current and anticipated future business demands 
based on expectations of continued growth  we plan to accelerate capital expenditures over the next few quarters 
we expect capital expenditures for equipment and facilities in to be approximately million 
this level of capital spending includes anticipated expenditures for potential international expansion opportunities 
we utilized an additional million during the year ended december  to acquire alcatel s coaxial cable business in seneffe  belgium 
during the year ended december   we received initial cash proceeds of million related to the sale of our high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business 
our principal sources of liquidity both on a short term and long term basis are cash flows provided by operations and funds available under long term credit facilities 
in december  in order to create a longer term capital structure  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due in the proceeds from these convertible notes were used primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit agreement 
additionally in  we borrowed million euros equivalent to million on the date of borrowing under a new variable rate term loan agreement to fund the acquisition of our coaxial cable business in seneffe  belgium 
including the convertible notes  we owed long term debt of million  or of our book capital structure  defined as long term debt and total stockholders equity  as of december   compared to million  or of our book capital structure as of december  based upon our analysis of our consolidated financial position and the expected results of our operations in the future  we believe that we will have sufficient cash flows from future operations and the financial flexibility to attract both short term and long term capital on acceptable terms as may be needed to fund operations  capital expenditures and other growth objectives 
there can be no assurance  however  that future industry specific developments  general economic trends or other situations will not adversely affect our operations or ability to meet cash requirements 
market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the use of derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments utilized by us  which are not entered into for speculative purposes  include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts  and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
our policy is to designate all derivatives as hedges and to account for the derivatives in the same manner as the item being hedged 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials are fabricated from commodity products that are openly traded on exchange markets and are subject to significant potential changes in market prices 
increases in the prices of certain commodity products could result in higher overall production costs 
we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars 
however  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar can adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the acquisition of our belgian subsidiary created a specific market risk that a decline in the value of the belgian franc or the euro compared to the us dollar could adversely affect our net investment in that subsidiary 
our eurodollar credit agreement  which is denominated in euros  serves as a hedge of our net investment in the belgian subsidiary 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was an interest rate swap agreement that serves as a fixed rate hedge to the variable rate borrowings under our eurodollar credit agreement  as required under the covenants of this term loan 
at december   we evaluated our commodity pricing and foreign currency exchange exposures and concluded that it was not currently beneficial to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current positions with respect to those exposures 
the fair values of the interest rate and commodity price swap contracts outstanding at december  and the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  are not material to our financial position 
our nonderivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  trade payables  and debt instruments 
at december   the book values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet are considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates  their short terms to maturity  or their short length of time outstanding 
fair value of the company s debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements 
the following table summarizes our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure 
the table presents principal cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
long term debt maturities by year in millions there total fair after value fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate variable rate eur average interest rate effects of inflation we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
the principal raw materials purchased by us fabricated aluminum  plastics  bimetals  copper and fiber are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers  the cost increases could have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial statements upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
our manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial statements 
newly issued accounting standards in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
the new standard requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning with the year ending december  we are currently evaluating the effects of sfas no 
on our financial statements and current disclosures 
european monetary union euro on january   several member countries of the european monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies of the participating countries will remain legal tender for a transition period between january  and january  we conduct business in member countries 
during the transition period  cashless payments for example  wire transfers can be made in the euro  and parties to individual transactions can elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and eventually withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
we are addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
among the issues facing us are the assessment and conversion of information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of legacy currencies 
in addition  we are reviewing certain existing contracts for potential modification and assessing our pricing marketing strategies in the affected european markets 
based on current information  we do not expect that the euro conversion will have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
year during  we completed our preparations to mitigate the risks posed by year compliance issues 
we prepared for the year risks through a corporate wide effort to modify  upgrade and replace various information technology and non information technology systems  devices  and applications 
to date  we have not experienced any significant year related problems with our information technology or non information technology systems  devices or applications 
in addition  we have not experienced any significant year related problems with any of our major customers or suppliers 
the costs of addressing year compliance issues were not material to our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and were financed through cash flows from operations 
we believe that we and our major customers and suppliers have become year compliant to ensure minimal business interruption to our operations 
however  we cannot assure you that problems associated with system failure or deficient system operation due to year compliance issues will not result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
information management system on january   we began the implementation of a new integrated information management system 
our goal for this new computer based system is to help us improve business practices  allow faster access to information and ultimately enable us to service our customers better in the future  among other things 
however  during january we experienced some delays in certain shipments in connection with the transition to this new information system 
during the first quarter of  we worked diligently to correct these transition issues and to increase shipping efforts to reduce the system related backlogs 
while this shipping issue may have a negative impact on our first quarter results  we do not believe that these transition issues will have a material impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition in however  we cannot assure you that we will incur no future issues with this system
