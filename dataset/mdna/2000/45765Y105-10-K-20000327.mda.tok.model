safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained herein and in the following section and like statements elsewhere in this report are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of various factors 
set forth below are the principal factors and risks considered most likely to cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
business review significant risk factors  while not all inclusive  are results of insignia pops program 
it will be necessary to achieve lift results from the insignia pops program that are comparable to the results to date from the insignia pops program in order to obtain additional participating manufacturers and retailers at the rate anticipated by the company 
competition 
insignia pops is competing for the marketing expenditures of branded product manufacturers  who use various forms of point of purchase marketing methods  such as displays  coupons  in store samples  etc 
there is no assurance that insignia pops will compete successfully with these traditional marketing methods 
sign production 
the company s ability to produce the planned number of signs will depend on a number of factors  including receipt of data and information from both the retailers and manufacturers and conducting the necessary training 
business conditions of the general economy 
cost of the raw material 
the company s printing gross margin percentage is a sensitive function of the cost of the raw paper materials 
sign card revenue 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue from the sale of the bar coded sign cards required by the impulse and signright systems  which are no longer being marketed domestically by the company 
if a substantial number of existing customers discontinue the use of the sign card there could be a serious adverse effect on the company s revenue 
dependence on key employees 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of its present officers  and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company 
none of the company s officers are bound by employment or non competition agreements with the company 
the success of the company will also depend on its ability to attract and retain capable sales and marketing personnel 
year compliance in prior years  the company developed and implemented plans to become year ready and in late completed remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
expenses resulting from the company s year efforts were not material 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting fromyear issues  either with services  internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
