the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  was principally due to the billion increase in the average balance of student loans over the decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended december  was mainly due to the decrease in the student loan spread discussed in more detail below  partially offset by the reduction in the average balance of lower yielding investments and warehousing advances taxable equivalent net interest income of million in decreased by million from in large part the decline was due to the billion reduction in the average balance of interest earning assets due to the securitization of student loans and the significant downsizing of other earning assets that occurred in the latter half of in  the average balance of student loans on balance sheet declined by billion while the average balance of the portfolio of securitized student loans increased by billion 
as the company moves student loans off balance sheet via its securitization activities  the earnings from those loans are  in effect  removed from net interest income and become elements of other income  specifically  gain on sale and servicing and securitization revenue

student loan income cost of funds student loan spread off balance sheet servicing and securitization revenue average balances in millions of dollars student loans    securitized loans    managed student loans    the company s portfolio of student loans originated under the ffelp has a variety of unique interest rate characteristics 
the company earns interest at the greater of the borrower s rate or a floating rate determined by reference to the average of the weekly auctions of day treasury bills by the government  plus a fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was originated 
if the floating rate exceeds the borrower rate  the department of education makes a payment directly to the company based upon the sap formula 
if the floating rate is less than the rate the borrower is obligated to pay  the company simply earns interest at the borrower rate 
in all cases  the rate a borrower is obligated to pay sets a minimum rate for determining the yield that the company earns on the loan 
borrowers interest rates are either fixed to term or are reset annually on july of each year depending on when the loan was originated 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average of the day treasury bill auctions  either directly or through the use of derivative financial instruments intended to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans 
such borrowings  however  generally do not have minimum rates 
as a result  in periods of declining interest rates  the portfolio of managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the company s funding costs exclusive of funding spreads will generally decline along with treasury bill rates 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is fixed to term  declining interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is reset annually  any benefit of a low interest rate environment will only enhance student loan spreads through the next annual reset of the borrower s interest rates  which occurs on july of each year

the basis point decrease in the student loan spread in versus is due mainly to higher financing spreads  including the impact of offset fees  which decreased the student loan spread by basis points and to lower sap rates which reduced the student loan spread by basis points 
the company s restructuring of its joint venture with chase manhattan bank the joint venture in december of  which replaced lower yielding participations with student loans  increased the student loan spread by basis points 
during  the company s on balance sheet student loan spread declined from percent in the first quarter to percent in the fourth quarter 
this decline can mainly be attributed to higher average interest rates and to the july reset of the borrower s interest rate 
also  the company expects further declines in the student loan spread as new loans with lower sap rates replace older loans with higher sap rates 
see other related events legislative developments for a discussion on higher education amendments of the student loan spread did not change from to this was due to the fact that the lower treasury bill rates in which increased student loan spread by basis points versus were offset by the higher financing spreads on the company s debt  including the impact of offset fees  higher consolidation loan rebate fees and lower sap rates which decreased the student loan spread by a total of basis points

under these contracts  referred to as floor interest contracts  the company receives an upfront payment and agrees to pay the difference between the minimum borrower interest rate less the applicable sap rate the strike rate and the average of the day treasury bill rates over the period of the contract 
if the strike rate is less than the average of the treasury bill rates  then no payment is required 
these upfront payments are being amortized over the average life of the contracts 
floor interest contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is reset annually historically have had terms through the next reset date  a period of one year or less  while floor interest contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term have multi year terms 
the billion of outstanding fixed borrower rate floor interest contracts at december  have expiration dates through the year  while the billion of annually reset borrower rate contracts expire on july  for the years ended december   and  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the sale of floor interest contracts on the company s on balance sheet student loans with fixed borrower rates was million  million and million  respectively  and for floor interest contracts with annually reset borrower rates was million  million and million  respectively

in  the company completed two securitization transactions in which a total of billion of student loans were securitized and in  the company completed four securitization transactions in which a total of billion of student loans were securitized 
the company accounts for its securitization transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  which establishes the accounting for certain financial asset transfers  including securitization transactions 
under sfas  the company records a gain on sale based upon the difference between the cost basis of the assets sold and the fair value of the assets received 
at the same time  the company records an asset the interest residual equal to the present value of the expected net cash flows from the trust to the company over the life of the portfolio securitized 
the gain is reduced by write offs of certain assets related to the portfolio sold and by transaction costs 
in addition  the company continues to service the loans in the trusts for a fee  and earns that fee over the life of the portfolio 
when the contract servicing fee is greater than current market servicing rates  the present value of such excess servicing fees is recognized as a servicing asset and amortized over the life of the portfolio serviced 
gains on student loan securitizations in the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  the company decided not to enter into securitization transactions due to the turbulence in the global financial markets that persisted after the russian bond default in august during this period  treasury bill rates  to which the company s asset backed securities are indexed  fell relative to other market indices  causing the company s financing spreads to widen 
as a result  although the company reentered the securitization market in  it securitized billion less in versus and billion less of student loans in versus for the years ended december   and  the company recorded pre tax securitization gains of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the gains in versus was mainly due to the reduction in securitization activity and to portfolio characteristics and higher financing spreads 
the decrease in the gains in versus was mainly due to the reduction in securitization activity 
included in the gains was a reversal of a pre tax million reserve for offset fees accrued previously as a result of the successful litigation over whether the offset fee applied to securitized student loans

there was no such revenue in the benefit of low treasury bill rates in was mainly earned in the first half of the year as the rise of treasury bill rates in the second half of the year combined with the annual reset of the borrower rate on certain student loans on july  reduced these earnings to only million for the second half of gain on sale of student loans during the fourth quarter of  the company sold million of student loan assets and recorded a pre tax gain of million

the increase in the purchase volume in versus  exclusive of the nellie mae acquisition and the restructuring of the company s joint venture with chase  is principally attributable to the resumption of the company s consolidation loan program in october  a program which was suspended from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of due to legislated changes in the profitability of consolidation 
the decrease in the purchase volume in versus is principally attributable to the following factors reduced acquisitions in the spot market  the suspension of the company s consolidation loan program offset by a modest increase in the amount of loans purchased from lenders who have forward purchase commitments with the company

cash basis provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the managed portfolio of student loans 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the provision for losses on its federally insured portfolio of student loans separately from its non federally insured portfolio 
for the federally insured portfolio  the company primarily considers trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors due to servicing defects as well as overall default rates on those ffelp student loans subject to the percent risk sharing 
once a student loan is charged off as a result of an unpaid claim  the company s policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest 
for the non federally insured portfolio of student loans the company primarily considers recent trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  historical trends in loan volume by program  economic conditions and credit and underwriting policies 
a large percentage of the company s non federally insured loans have not matured to a point at which predictable loan loss patterns have developed 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio

weighted average borrowing rate federal and state taxes the company maintains a portfolio of tax advantaged assets principally to support education related financing activities 
that portfolio was primarily responsible for the decrease in the effective federal income tax rate from the statutory rate of percent to percent in  and the gse is exempt from all state  local  and district of columbia income  franchise  sales and use  personal property and other taxes  except for real property taxes 
however  this tax exemption applies only to the gse and does not apply to slm holding or its other operating subsidiaries 
under the privatization act  the company s gse and non gse activities are separated  with non gse activities being subject to taxation at the state and local level 
state taxes were immaterial during the three years ended december  as the majority of the company s income was generated through the gse 
as increasing business activity occurs outside of the gse  the impact of state and local taxes will increase accordingly 
ultimately all business activities will occur outside of the gse  which could increase the company s effective income tax rate by as much as five percentage points 
the loss of the gse tax exemption for sales and use and personal property taxes could increase operating costs by one percentage point 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s primary requirements for capital are to fund the company s operations  its purchases of student loans and the repayment of its debt obligations while continuing to meet the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio test 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are through debt issuances by the gse  off balance sheet financings through securitizations  borrowings under its commercial paper program  cash generated by its subsidiaries operations and distributed through dividends to the company and bank borrowings 
gse financing activities the gse secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans  along with its other operations  by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets  through public offerings and private placements of us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics  and through securitizations of its student loans 
the gse s debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both moody s investors service and standard poor s 
historically  the agencies ratings of the gse have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise 
since the privatization act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the gse  management anticipates that the gse will retain its current credit ratings 
the company s unsecured financing requirements are driven by three principal factors refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature  financing of student loan portfolio growth  and the company s level of securitization activity 
the lingering effects of the august russian bond default plus uncertainty over the year computer issue has caused funding spreads on both the company s unsecured debt and its asset backed securities to remain wider than in recent years 
management believes that this adverse spread environment is temporary  accordingly  to mitigate its effect on the company s cost of funds  the company has been meeting the majority of its on balance sheet funding needs through the issuance of short term unsecured gse debt 
should these market conditions persist over an extended period of time  the increased cost of the company s funding could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
securitization activities in addition to the gse debt  student loan securitization has been an important source of funding for the company s managed student loan portfolio since as student loans are securitized  the need for long term financing of these on balance sheet assets decreases 
over the long term  securitization is expected to provide the principal source of long term funding for the company s managed portfolio of student loans 
management believes that securitizations represent an efficient source of funding 
the company s asset backed securities generally have a higher cost of funds than its traditional on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded and do not benefit from the gse s status 
however  the increased funding costs of the asset backed securities are mitigated by the absence of the offset fees on securitized loans 
securitization also allows the company to obtain term financing at a lower cost than otherwise would be achievable without the gse s government sponsored status 
securitizations to date have been structured to achieve an aaa credit rating on over percent of its securities sold with an a credit rating on the remaining subordinated securities 
as mentioned above  the russian bond default in august caused financing spreads on the company s securitization transactions to be wider and thus more costly than the previous year s transactions 
as a result  the company did not enter into a securitization transaction from september through may of financial market conditions did improve to a point at which it was economical to securitize student loans  and in the second quarter of  the company reentered the asset backed securities market by completing a billion securitization 
in  the company completed three securitization transactions totaling billion in student loans 
during  demand for treasury bill indexed securities remained high causing treasury bill rates to remain low relative to other market indices 
as a consequence  the company issued billion in libor based asset backed securities  the first issuances indexed to libor in the history of the program 
the company is managing this off balance sheet basis risk through on balance sheet financing activities  principally through basis swaps 
other financing activities in order to finance non gse activities and in preparation for the eventual wind down of the gse  slm holding is developing additional financing vehicles 
while continued use of the securitization market will be the core of slm holding s financing strategy  these efforts will be supplemented by commercial paper  asset backed commercial paper  bank lines of credit  underwritten long term debt  and a medium term note program 
in the third quarter of  slm holding received credit ratings that will facilitate its access to the private funding markets short term debt ratings of a  f and p  and long term senior unsecured debt ratings of a  a and a were issued by standard poor s  fitch ibca  inc  and moody s investors service  respectively 
upon receiving its initial credit ratings  the company initiated its commercial paper program 
to provide liquidity support for the company s commercial paper program  the company secured a backup credit facility that consisted of a million day and a million year revolving credit facilities that are available for general corporate purposes 
the facility replaced an existing million bank line of credit that expired in october on november   the company sold million shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock  series a in a registered public offering 
the sale of the shares of the series a preferred stock settled on november  the proceeds from the sale to the company  before expenses  were million and will be used for general corporate purposes 
the shares do not have any maturity date but are subject at the company s option  beginning november   to be redeemed at any time  in whole or in part  at the redemption price of plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption date 
the shares have no preemptive or conversion rights 
during  the company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt of billion  the proceeds from student loan securitizations of billion  repayments and claim payments on student loans of billion  and the net proceeds from sales of student loans to purchase student loans of billion  to purchase net investments of billion  to repurchase million of the company s common stock and to purchase nellie mae corporation for million in cash and stock 
operating activities provided net cash inflows of million in  an increase of million from the net cash inflows of million in during  the company issued billion of long term notes to refund maturing and repurchased obligations 
at december   the company had billion of outstanding long term debt issues of which billion had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions 
the company uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps collateralized where appropriate  purchases of us treasury securities and other hedging techniques to reduce its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations that arise from its financing activities and to match the variable interest rate characteristics of its earning assets 
see interest rate risk management 
until the gse is dissolved  the privatization act places a number of limitations on the company 
under the privatization act  the gse must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september  any gse debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust  consisting of us government or agency obligations with cash flows matching the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt 
the privatization act requires that on the dissolution date of september   the gse shall repurchase or redeem  or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock 
the company has the option of effecting an earlier dissolution of the gse if certain conditions are met 
also upon the gse s dissolution  all of its remaining assets will transfer to the company 
the privatization act effectively requires that the gse maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets plus percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items of at least percent until january  and percent thereafter or be subject to certain safety and soundness requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio 
management anticipates being able to fund the increase in required capital from the gse s current and retained earnings 
while the gse may not finance the activities of its non gse affiliates  it may  subject to its minimum capital requirements  dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to slm holding  which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act requires management to certify to the secretary of the treasury that  after giving effect to the payment of dividends  the statutory capital ratio test would have been met at the time the dividend was declared 
at december   the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio  after the effect of the dividends to be paid in the first quarter of  was percent 
the privatization act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the gse and its affiliates during the wind down period 
in particular  the gse must not extend credit to  nor guarantee  any debt obligations of slm holding or its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act provides that the gse may continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before september  the legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the gse s debt obligations  including securities and exchange commission sec registration and state tax exemptions  will be fully preserved until their respective maturities 
such debt obligations will remain gse debt obligations  whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of  or issued subsequent to  the reorganization 
the obligations of slm holding do not have gse status 
interest rate risk management interest rate gap analysis the company s principal objective in financing its operations is to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by matching the interest rate characteristics of its borrowings to specific assets in order to lock in spreads 
the company funds its floating rate managed loan assets most of which have weekly rate resets with variable rate debt and fixed rate debt converted to variable rates with interest rate swaps 
the company also uses interest rate cap and collar agreements  foreign currency swaps  options on securities  and financial futures contracts to further reduce interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure on certain of its borrowings 
investments are funded on a pooled approach  ie  the pool of liabilities that funds the investment portfolio has an average rate and maturity or reset date that corresponds to the average rate and maturity or reset date of the investments which they fund 
in addition to term match funding  the company s asset backed securities generally match the interest rate characteristics of the majority of the student loans in the trusts by being indexed to the day treasury bill 
however  at december   there were approximately billion of plus student loans outstanding in the trusts  which have interest rates that reset annually based on the final auction of week treasury bills before each july the company manages this basis risk within the trusts through its on balance sheet financing activities 
the effect of this basis risk management is included in the following table as the impact of securitized student loans 
in the table below the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index 
fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates 
an interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals

interest rate sensitivity analysis the effect of short term movements in interest rates on the company s results of operations and financial position has been limited through the company s risk management activities 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the annual effect of a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of percent on the company s variable rate assets and liabilities and a hypothetical percent increase in spreads to their underlying index 
based on this analysis an increase in rates and spreads of this magnitude would reduce net income by approximately million or 
diluted earnings per share 
the decline in net income would be primarily due to the reduction on the spread earned on student loans as financing costs would increase while a significant portion of the company s student loan portfolio would continue to earn at the minimum borrower rate 
the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets and its long term debt and hedging instruments are also subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
a separate analysis was performed to determine the effects of a hypothetical percent rise in market interest rates on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the effect of the percent rise in rates on fair values would be a decrease in the fair market value of student loans of approximately million  and a decrease in the fair market value of non student loan assets and liabilities and equity of approximately million 
the decrease in the fair market value of these assets would be partially offset by an increase in the fair market value of the company s long term debt and hedging instruments by million 
the net effect of a percent raise in rates on fair market values would therefore be million decrease in net assets 
this decrease in the net asset market value from a rise in rates is mainly caused by the reduction in the student loan spread as a significant portion of the company s student loan portfolio would continue to earn at the minimum borrower interest rate while the related financing costs would be rising by percent 
these amounts have been determined after considering the impact of a hypothetical shift in interest rates and the use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments with no other changes in the company s financial structure 
the analysis is limited because it does not take into account the overall level of economic activity  other operating transactions and other management actions that could be taken to further mitigate the company s exposure to risk 
average terms to maturity the following table reflects the average terms to maturity for the company s managed earning assets and liabilities at december  average terms to maturity in years on off balance balance sheet sheet managed earning assets student loans warehousing advances academic facilities financings cash and investments total earning assets borrowings short term borrowings 

long term borrowings total borrowings in the above table  treasury receipts and variable rate asset backed securities  although generally liquid in nature  extend the weighted average remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to years 
as student loans are securitized  the need for long term on balance sheet financing will decrease

this act includes a provision that changes the index on which lender returns are set in the federal family education loan program from the current day treasury bill rate to a three month commercial paper rate 
the new index will apply to all loans originated after january  and before july  the rates that students pay on their ffelp loans are unaffected by the new index 
the company and other ffelp industry participants supported this legislative change 
administration s fy budget proposal on february  president clinton submitted his fiscal year budget proposal to congress 
the budget proposes significant savings from the student loan programs  principally from the ffelp 
the major proposals for student loans are the following reduce special allowance payments basis points from three month commercial paper plus to three month commercial paper plus  and eliminate all special allowance on tax exempt loans subject to a interest rate floor 
all these proposals may be considered by congress as it deliberates on the fy budget 
while the company does not expect any of these proposals to pass  if they were to pass as proposed  the company s earnings could be materially adversely affected 
year issue the year issue refers to a wide variety of potential computer program processing and functionality issues that may arise from the inability of computer programs to properly process date sensitive information relating to the year  years thereafter and to a lesser degree the year during  the company commenced a year readiness project to assess and remediate its internal software and hardware systems to avoid or mitigate year problems and to evaluate year problems that may arise from entities with which the company interacts 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any significant year problems with any internal software or hardware systems or with any of our significant external business partners 
the company cannot be sure we will be completely successful in our efforts to address the year issue or that problems arising from the year issue will not cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
the company believes  however  that our most reasonably likely worst case scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with our internal systems 
we are limited in our efforts to address the year issue as it relates to third parties and rely solely on the assurances of these third parties as to their year preparedness
