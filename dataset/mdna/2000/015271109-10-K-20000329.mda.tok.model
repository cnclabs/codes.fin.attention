the balance shown represents the amount drawn on a construction loan that provides for borrowings of up to  the following is a summary of the scheduled principal payments for our secured debt as of december  in thousands year amount thereafter  subtotal  unamortized premium  unsecured line of credit at december   we had an unsecured line of credit that provided for borrowings of up to million 
on february   we amended our unsecured line of credit to provide for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the line of credit  as amended  bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a libor based rate or the higher of the bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus 
for each libor based advance  we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one  two  three or six months 
the line of credit  as amended  contains financial covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of minimum net worth  a total liabilities to gross asset value ratio  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the terms of the line of credit restrict  among other things  certain investments  indebtedness  distributions and mergers 
borrowings under the line of credit  as amended  are limited to an amount based on a pool of unencumbered assets 
accordingly  as we acquire additional unencumbered properties  borrowings available under the line of credit  as amended  will increase 
as of december   borrowings under the line of credit were limited to approximately  and carried a weighted average interest rate of 
as of february   borrowings under the line of credit  as amended  were limited to approximately  the line of credit  as amended  expires february and provides for an annual extension provided there is no default for an additional one year period upon notice by the company and consent of the participating banks 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with fleetboston financial the bank to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
interest paid is calculated at a fixed interest rate of through may  on a notional amount of million  and interest received is calculated at one month libor 
the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
in october  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement with the bank to further hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
interest paid will be calculated at a fixed interest rate of through may  on a notional amount of million and interest received will be calculated at one month libor 
this agreement has no effect on our september interest rate swap agreement 
in january  we entered into a third interest rate swap agreement with the bank to further hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
interest paid is calculated at a fixed interest rate of from february  to march   from april  to july   from august  to december  and from december  to december  on a notional amount of million and interest received is calculated at one month libor 
this agreement has no effect on our september and october interest rate swap agreements 
with respect to our swap agreements  we are exposed to losses in the event the bank is unable to perform under the agreements  or in the event one month libor is less than the agreed upon fixed interest rates 
the fair value of the swap agreements outstanding as of december  and changes in their fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the financial statements 
other resources and liquidity requirements in february  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our series a preferred stock including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
the dividends on our series a preferred stock are cumulative and accrue from the date of original issuance 
we pay dividends quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of per share 
our series a preferred stock has no stated maturity  is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not redeemable prior to june   except in order to preserve our status as a real estate investment trust reit 
on or after june   we may  at our option  redeem our series a preferred stock  in whole or in part  at any time for cash at a redemption price of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as property acquisitions  property development activities  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through excess net cash provided by operating activities  long term secured and unsecured borrowings  including borrowings under the line of credit and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed 
capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs the following table shows total and weighted average per square foot capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants or are revenue enhancing for the years ended december     and  attributable to leases that commenced at our properties after our acquisition 
total weighted average capital expenditures weighted average square feet in portfolio       property related capital expenditures       per weighted average square foot in portfolio tenant improvements and leasing costs retenanted space retenanted square feet       tenant improvements and leasing costs       per square foot leased renewal space renewal square feet       tenant improvements and leasing costs     per square foot leased capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants 
we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required 
tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies  property characteristics  the type of lease renewal tenant or retenanted space  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
inflation as of december   approximately of our leases on a square footage basis were triple net leases  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance  common area and other operating expenses including increases thereto 
in addition  approximately of our leases on a square footage basis required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses 
approximately of our leases on a square footage basis contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed ranging from to or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in our variable rate borrowing cost  including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit 
impact of the year the year issue was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs having time sensitive software could have recognized a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send tenant invoices  provide building services or engage in similar normal business activities 
in october  we formed an internal task force to identify  assess and evaluate our critical systems to determine which year related problems might cause system errors or failures 
we identified three major areas as critical systems i internal accounting systems  ii systems of significant tenants  vendors and financial institutions  and iii internal building systems at our properties 
we engaged consulting professionals from a nationally recognized accounting firm to review our plans and assist us with our solutions 
our year project was designed to ensure that all critical systems were evaluated and suitable for continued use into and beyond the year we completed our identification and initial evaluation of our critical systems in the first quarter of  and implemented all of the necessary remedial actions 
we completed our review and testing of our internal accounting systems 
all of these systems are year compliant 
we place a high degree of reliance on computer systems of third parties  such as tenants  vendors and financial institutions 
although we were assessing the readiness of these third parties  we could not guarantee that they would be year compliant in a timely manner 
we surveyed significant third party vendors and financial institutions  and all surveyed indicated that they had implemented year programs 
in addition  we surveyed our significant tenants for their year readiness 
we participated in surveys with new tenants  vendors and other third party suppliers 
if risk assessments of third party suppliers or tenants indicated significant exposure to the year problem  the supplier or tenant was asked to demonstrate how the problems would be addressed 
the task force completed its evaluation of internal systems in our properties that may have had embedded microprocessors with potential year problems  mainly building systems  including heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  elevators and security systems 
based on the results of our review  certain of our properties had critical systems that required upgrades for year readiness 
upgrades were completed at all of these properties in the second and third quarters of in some instances  we used the services of outside experts to test and review our findings and to confirm that our building systems are year compliant 
our year project costs  including the costs of remedial activities and outside experts  were not material 
the aggregate cost of purchasing conversion packages for the accounting systems and the cost to survey tenants  vendors and financial institutions were also not material 
in addition  substantially all costs incurred to review the building systems and to replace or upgrade them constituted property maintenance costs  and were therefore generally recoverable from the tenants pursuant to the terms of their existing leases 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to make distributions 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in its october white paper the white paper  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for our discretionary use because a portion of ffo is needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
see cash flows for information regarding these measures of cash flow

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor 
however  due to the purchase of our interest rate swap agreements  the current effects of interest rate changes are reduced 
based on interest rates at  and our swap agreements in effect on  december   a increase in interest rates on our line of credit would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  by approximately  a decrease in interest rates on our line of credit would increase annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  by approximately  a increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their fair value by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their fair value by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured note receivable would not have a material impact on its fair value 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
if we were to include the impact of our new interest rate swap agreement effective february under the same conditions set forth above  a increase in interest rates on our line of credit would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  by approximately  a decrease in interest rates on our line of credit would increase annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  by approximately  a increase in interest rates on our secured debt and our interest rate swap agreements would decrease their fair value by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and our interest rate swap agreements would increase their fair value by approximately million
