currency fluctuation reptron pays for its purchases from foreign sources  including asian manufacturers  in us dollars  which reduces the adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
reptron has not experienced substantial adverse effects from currency fluctuations to date 
liquidity and capital resources reptron primarily finances its operations through subordinated notes  operating cash flows  bank credit lines  capital equipment leases and short term financing through supplier credit lines 
on january   reptron entered into a million revolving credit agreement credit agreement with pnc bank the lender to replace its existing million revolving credit facility with nationsbank the nationsbank credit facility 
in october  the credit agreement was increased to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all of reptron s inventory  accounts receivable  equipment and general intangibles 
the credit agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures and prohibits the payment of dividends thereby restricting the distribution of the retained earnings of reptron 
reptron may  at its option  and upon notice to the lender  request advance funds pursuant to either a domestic rate loan or a eurodollar rate loan 
upon notice to the lender  reptron may convert advances from one type of loan to the other 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  were approximately million 
as of december   reptron was in compliance with  or received waivers  on all covenants under the credit agreement 
reptron has entered into various capital lease transactions with several financial institutions to finance capital expenditures  primarily for the k byte manufacturing operation 
these leases had an aggregate balance of million as of december  the leases bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and expire at various dates through july  reptron s operating activities used cash of approximately million in this decrease was primarily a result of an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  a decrease in accrued expenses of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  these items were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in income taxes payable of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the increase in inventory and accounts receivable is primarily a result of the expansion in sales during the second half of inventory turns improved slightly from to turns in and accounts receivable collections improved to an average of days as of december  from an average of days as of december  reptron used cash of approximately million in investing activities in  comprised of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of applied instruments and million in purchase of property  plant and equipment 
reptron redeemed approximately million of subordinated notes in for about million in cash 
additionally  the company increased its outstanding debt due under the credit agreement by approximately million 
this increase was necessary to finance rapidly growing operations 
reptron believes that cash generated from operations  available cash reserves and available credit facilities will be sufficient or reptron to meet its capital expenditures and working capital needs for its operations as presently conducted 
reptron s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities and possible acquisitions 
in particular  if cash flows from operations and available credit facilities are not sufficient  it will be necessary for reptron to seek additional financing 
while there can be assurance that such financing would be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to reptron  reptron believes that such financing would likely be available on acceptable terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reptron entered into an interest rate swap agreement during the swap agreement effectively converts a portion of reptron s floating interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt 
notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received relating to such agreements and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
under the terms of the agreement  reptron is obligated to pay interest on a notional amount to the extent that the fixed rate of  under the interest rate swap agreement  exceeds the libor rate  as measured pursuant to the agreement 
furthermore  reptron will receive interest to the extent that the libor rate exceeds the fixed rate 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap agreement totaled approximately million which will mature in march  interest received  if any  as a result of this agreement is netted against interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding throughout  a basis point change in libor would have caused reptron s interest expense to change by approximately  reptron believes that this amount is not significant to the results of operations 
on march   the company terminated the swap agreement at no additional costs
