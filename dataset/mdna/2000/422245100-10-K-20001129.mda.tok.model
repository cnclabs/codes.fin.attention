the following table sets forth the sources of the company s revenues by customer type as a percentage of total revenues from continuing operations for the three years ended august   and year ended august  health plan contracts hospital contracts other while the company s revenues historically have been generated primarily by its operating contracts with hospitals  a majority of its fiscal and revenues were generated from programs that are designed to assist health plans in reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of care for individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease enrolled in their plans 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future revenue growth will result from providing disease and care management services to health plans 
implementation of the company s first disease management contracts with health plans occurred in fiscal for enrollees of these health plans with diabetes 
while continuing to contract with additional health plans to provide diabetes services in the years since fiscal  the company introduced its cardiac disease management program in fiscal and its respiratory disease management program in fiscal during fiscal the company signed its first contracts with health plans to deliver its cardiac and its respiratory disease programs 
the company s disease management products assist enrollees and the providers of healthcare in the contracting health plans with specific disease related care and treatment as well as provide assistance for the overall needs of populations of individuals with a specific chronic disease 
the company believes that its patient and physician support regimens  delivered and or supervised by a multi disciplinary team  will assist in assuring that the most effective care for the treatment of the disease is provided to enrollees and that this focus will improve the health status of the enrollee populations with the disease and will reduce both the short term and long term healthcare costs of these enrollees 
the company s disease management services for health plans are designed to meet the needs of individual health plan customers 
the company provides clinical and support staff who are responsible for coordinating and supporting the treatment of individuals with chronic diseases such as diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease in accordance with treatment standards and protocols that have been developed by the company and have been approved by the medical leadership at each health plan 
in most contracts  individuals with a targeted disease in these plans are automatically enrolled in the company s program but are permitted to decline to participate 
historically  less than have declined to participate 
the actual treatment of the individuals is provided by physicians  hospitals and other ancillary service providers who are part of the health plan s network of providers 
the company s services range from telephone and mail contacts directed primarily to enrollees with targeted diseases that can be provided from one of the company s four centralized operating unit call centers to services that also include providing local market resources to address acute episode interventions as well as coordination of care with local healthcare providers 
the fees charged by the company vary according to the level of service being provided under each of its health plan customer contracts and are structured primarily as a monthly fee for each member of the health plan identified with the particular chronic disease under contract 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal and typically provide that between and of the company s fees are at risk subject to the company s performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
the company records revenue from its performance based health plan contracts based on its estimates of expected performance levels under these contracts and adjusts these estimates as additional data necessary to determine performance levels becomes available 
the company anticipates that additional disease management contracts that the company may sign with health plans may take one of several forms  including some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  per member per month payments to the company to cover its services to enrollees  or some combination of these arrangements 
the company anticipates that under most contracts  some portion of the company s fees will be at risk subject to its performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
myhealthways sm will address a broader population base in a health plan than only those members with chronic diseases 
the program will provide personalized assessments and customized action plans to health plan members and their physicians which enable proactive intervention with patients who are identified to be at increased risk for a variety of treatable health problems 
myhealthways sm is intended to help mitigate the effects of or prevent certain health problems 
while no contracts have been executed to date for the myhealthways sm product  it is anticipated that the structure for these contracts will be similar to the company s contracts for its disease management products and could involve some portion of the company s fees at risk subject to meeting performance criteria 
disease management contracts require a sophisticated management information system to enable the company to manage the care of large populations of patients with diabetes  cardiac disease and respiratory disease and to assist in reporting outcomes and costs 
the company has developed a clinical management system which it believes meets its information management needs for its disease and care management services and has installed and is utilizing the system for the enrollees of each of its health plan contract customers 
during the fiscal year ended august   this system was upgraded to enable it to handle additional diseases other than diabetes from a common platform and to increase the company s central operating unit call center capabilities and efficiency with the installation of state of the art dialing  call routing  and information access technologies 
the company has also developed an internet based enrollee and provider communication capability for one of its health plan customers 
the company anticipates expansion of this capability to other customers as well as enhancement of its internet communication technology 
the capital expenditures required during fiscal to upgrade the company s information technology capability and to add service capacity through the completion of centralized operating unit call centers in phoenix  arizona  pittsburgh  pennsylvania and honolulu  hawaii totaled approximately million 
as a result of these expenditures  the company had the infrastructure to provide disease and care management services to approximately  equivalent lives as of august  compared with a capacity of approximately  equivalent lives at the beginning of fiscal year at august   the company had contracts with health plans to provide disease management services in health plan markets 
the company reports the number of disease lives under its health plan contracts utilizing a calculation of equivalent covered lives 
because the company s original disease management efforts focused on enrollees with diabetes and the majority of its lives as of the end of fiscal were diabetes lives  contracted enrollee lives for its cardiac and its respiratory programs are converted into the revenue and service cost equivalent of a diabetes enrollee for reporting and internal management purposes 
while the average service intensity and the company s fee per cardiac enrollee is greater than the service intensity and fee per diabetes enrollee  the company believes that the contribution margin percentage is similar for its diabetes lives and its cardiac disease lives 
the average service and fee intensity of the company s respiratory disease program varies in comparison with a diabetes enrollee depending on whether it involves a lower intensity asthma population or a higher intensity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease population 
however  as with its cardiac disease program  the company believes that the contribution margin percentage is similar for its diabetes lives and its respiratory disease lives 
the number of equivalent lives under management and generating revenues for the company as well as the number of equivalent lives under contract and scheduled for implementation but not currently generating revenue are shown below at august   and at august  equivalent lives under management    equivalent lives in backlog    total equivalent lives    subsequent to august   the company executed a contract to provide cardiac disease management services to approximately  equivalent lives in cigna healthcare health plans 
services for these enrollees and fee revenue for the company under this contract is currently scheduled to be phased in during the six month period beginning april   and are subject to the company providing a letter of credit of up to million to support the company s performance under the contract 
during the fiscal years ended august  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from contracts with two health plans 
the loss of either of these contracts or a reduction in the profitability of these contracts would have a material negative impact on the company s financial operations 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company restructured a contract with one of these health plans  which resulted in a material reduction in revenues and profits under this contract beginning january  the company s health plan contract revenues are dependent upon the contractual relationships it establishes and maintains with client health plans to provide disease management services to their members 
the terms of these health plan contracts generally range from three to five years with some contracts providing for early termination by the health plan under certain conditions 
because the disease management industry is relatively new and the company s contracts were some of the first large scale contracts to be executed with health plans for disease management services  the renewal experience in this industry is limited 
no assurances can be given that the results from restructurings and possible terminations at renewal would not have a material negative impact on the company s results of operations 
during the three years ended august   four health plan contracts have been terminated 
two of these contracts involved pilot programs which ended by mutual consent at the end of their terms 
the other two contracts were terminated early as the result of the acquisition of the company s health plan customers by other health plans who did not wish to continue providing the services 
during the fiscal year ending august   four health plan customer contracts representing approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal are eligible to be terminated under the terms of the contracts 
no assurance can be given that the results of these renewals or possible contract terminations would not have a material negative impact on the company s net income during fiscal the company s hospital based diabetes treatment centers are located in and operated under contracts with general acute care hospitals 
the primary goal of each center is to create a center of excellence for the treatment of diabetes in the community in which it is located and thereby increase the hospital s market share of diabetes patients and lower the hospital s cost of providing services while enhancing the quality of care to this population 
fee structures under the hospital contracts consist of either fixed management fees  variable fees based on the company s performance or a combination thereof 
variable fees based upon performance generally provide for fee payments to the company based on changes in the client hospital s market share of diabetes inpatients  the costs of providing care to these patients  and quality of care measurements 
the company has renewed or entered into new contracts in recent years that included primarily fixed management fee arrangements 
the terms of hospital contracts generally range from two to five years and are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal that may include reduction in fee structures which have a negative impact on the company s revenues and profitability 
the form of these contracts includes various structures ranging from arrangements where all costs of the company s program for center professional personnel  medical director fees and community relations are the responsibility of the company to structures where all company program costs are the responsibility of the client hospital 
the company is paid directly by the hospital 
patients receiving services from the diabetes treatment centers are charged by the hospital for typical hospital services 
the company s hospital based diabetes treatment center business had contracts in effect in states at august  the company also had a contract to operate a hospital based arthritis and osteoporosis treatment center 
the following table presents the number of total contracts in effect during the past three fiscal years year ended august  contracts in effect at beginning of period contracts signed contracts discontinued contracts in effect at end of period hospital sites where services are delivered during fiscal  hospital contracts were renewed 
several of these renewals included contract rate reductions  which the company has undertaken to maintain favorable long term contractual relationships 
also during fiscal  hospital contracts were discontinued 
several of these contracts were lower revenue and lower margin contracts with limited impact on the company s profitability 
there were no material continuing obligations or costs for the company associated with the termination of any client hospital contracts 
the company anticipates that continued hospital industry pressures to reduce costs because of constrained revenues will result in a continuation of contract rate reductions and the potential for additional contract terminations 
during fiscal  contracts are eligible to be terminated under the terms of the contracts with the hospitals 
the company s strategy is to develop additional relationships with health plans to provide care and disease management services and to further develop and expand its hospital based diabetes treatment center business 
the company anticipates that it will utilize its state of the art call center and medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering its health plan disease management services 
in addition  the company plans to add services  such as myhealthways sm  to its product mix for health plans that will extend the company s programs beyond its current chronic disease focus and will be designed to enhance the ability of health plans to create a positive health care relationship with all of their members  not just those who are chronically ill 
it is anticipated that some of these new services will be added through strategic alliances with other entities and that the company may choose to make minority interest investments in one or more of these entities 
the company anticipates that additional disease management contracts that the company may sign with health plans may take one of several forms  including some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  per member per month payments to the company to cover its services to enrollees  or some combination of these arrangements 
the company anticipates that under most contracts  some portion of the company s fees will be at risk subject to its performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
on june   the company s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan under which holders of common stock as of june  received preferred stock purchase rights as a dividend at the rate of one right per share 
each right initially entitles its holder to purchase one one hundredth of a new series a preferred share at  subject to adjustment 
upon becoming exercisable  each right will allow the holder other than the person or group whose actions have triggered the exercisability of the rights  under alternative circumstances  to buy either securities of the company or securities of the acquiring company depending on the form of the transaction having a value of twice the then current exercise price of the rights 
with certain exceptions  each right will become exercisable only when a person or group acquires  or commences a tender or exchange offer for  or more of the company s outstanding common stock 
rights will also become exercisable in the event of certain mergers or asset sales involving more than of the company s assets or earning power 
the rights will expire on june  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues of million from to resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of equivalent lives enrolled in the company s health plan disease management contracts to approximately  for from approximately  for this increase in the average number of equivalent lives under management was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed during fiscal and the average revenue per member per month for enrollees under the company s health plan contracts for was less than for this decrease in average per member per month revenue occurred primarily as a result of a greater mix of equivalent lives from new contracts with lower revenue intensity levels during compared with  the negative impact during of reduced revenue from a contract with one of the company s health plan customers which was restructured effective january   and as a result of non recurring negative revenue adjustments of approximately million recorded during related to the resolution of billing eligibility issues with two health plan customers 
the increase in health plan contract revenues was offset partially by decreased revenues from hospital treatment center contracts 
revenues from the company s hospital contract operations for were less than for on fewer average number of contracts in operation during as compared with average revenue per hospital contract was approximately lower in than in due primarily to contract fee reductions and to a greater mix of relatively newer contracts with somewhat lower fees in compared with the company anticipates that revenues for fiscal will increase over fiscal revenues primarily as a result of additional lives enrolled under its existing and anticipated new health plan contracts offset somewhat by lower revenues from hospital contract operations resulting from contract fee reductions and contract terminations 
the increase in salaries and benefits of million for over resulted primarily from higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of equivalent lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts as well as increased staffing levels during associated with improvements in the company s health plan information technology capabilities and increases in central operating unit call center service capacity for future growth 
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues increased to for from for primarily as a result of higher staffing levels associated with its health plan operations including the costs associated with information technology improvements and service capacity expansion

other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for from for primarily as a result of higher costs associated with increases in the average number of lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts as well as from costs associated with health plan related information technology improvements and service capacity expansion 
the company anticipates other operating expenses will increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of increased costs associated with anticipated increases in the number of lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million for from resulted principally from increased depreciation expense associated with information technology related capital expenditures for its health plan operations  including the addition of two new central operating unit call centers and the conversion of another health plan site to a central operating unit call center during fiscal in addition  depreciation and amortization expense increased during as a result of the company s leasehold improvements and other costs related to the company s relocated and expanded corporate and primary support office location in nashville  tennessee 
the company anticipates depreciation and amortization expense to increase during compared with fiscal primarily as a result of additional information technology and other capital expenditures associated with expected increases in the number of equivalent lives enrolled under the company s health plan contracts and the full year impact during of capital expenditures made during the company s income tax expense of  for compared to million for resulted from decreased profitability in compared to the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and the company s effective tax rates during and are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes  primarily the amortization of excess costs over net assets of purchased companies 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for included million resulting from the settlement with a health plan  which terminated its disease management contract with the company effective july  in connection with its acquisition by another health plan

revenues from the company s hospital contract operations for were less than for on a slightly higher average number of contracts in operation during as compared with this reduction in hospital contract revenue is due primarily to contract fee reductions and to a greater mix of relatively newer contracts with somewhat lower fees in compared with the increase in salaries and benefits of million for over resulted primarily from higher staffing levels associated with increases in the number of equivalent lives enrolled in the company s health plan contracts partially offset by decreased employee incentive compensation awards associated with operating performance during and approximately  in severance and other employee related costs incurred in associated with the acquisition related contract termination

financing activities for fiscal used million in cash flow primarily resulting from the company s repurchase of its common stock 
in january  the company executed a financing agreement with a financial institution which provides the company with up to million in borrowing capacity  including the ability to issue up to million of letters of credit  under a credit facility that expires in january borrowings under this agreement bear interest at above libor  are secured by the company s accounts receivable and contract rights and are guaranteed by the company s subsidiaries 
the agreement also contains various financial covenants and limits the amount of repurchases of the company s common stock

the company anticipates that it will be able to expand its ability to issue letters of credit under its existing or under new financing agreements but no assurances can be given that it will be successful in securing this financing capability on terms that would be acceptable to the company 
the company believes that cash flow from operating activities  its available cash balances of million at august  and available credit under its financing agreement will continue to enable the company to fund its working capital needs and other expenditures associated with the growth and expansion of its health plan operations including expenditures and minority interest investments required to implement its strategy to extend the company s health plan programs beyond its current chronic disease focus 
however  to the extent that the expansion of the company s health plan operations requires significant financing resources through the issuance of letters of credit to support the company s performance  the company s ability to arrange such financing capability will be limited and the company s ability to expand its health plan operations may be restricted
