no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in identifying any new business opportunities or that any such enterprise will be successful 
cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets the principal business activity of the company through february was to provide viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
a viatical settlement is the payment of cash in return for an ownership interest in  and right to receive the death benefit face value of  a life insurance policy 
in the third quarter of  the company decided to sell all or substantially all of its assets at that time 
in february  point west capital s board decided to cease the company s viatical settlement business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
through december   the company had entered into agreements to sell policies with an aggregate sale price of million  representing million in aggregate face value

as a result of the decision in the third quarter of to sell all or substantially all of the company s assets  the company reclassified all of its assets at that time other than the policies held by dpfc to a held for sale category during the third quarter of accordingly  these assets are accounted for at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
method of consolidation the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  ventures  allegiance and pws

allegiance capital owns of both allegiance funding and allegiance management 
allegiance funding owns approximately of allegiance trust i 
the allegiance financing does not qualify for sale treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas because the terms of the allegiance financing entitle allegiance funding to repurchase loans prior to the point at which the cost of servicing them becomes burdensome 
accordingly  the allegiance financing will not receive gain on sale treatment under sfas the loans and borrowings under the allegiance financing are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
point west formed allegiance capital in september  and made the only capital contribution to allegiance capital 
during  point west capital was allocated of the interest on loans through november   which was the initial funding date for the allegiance financing 
point west capital is allocated a preferred return based on the weighted average interest rate of all loans outstanding to the extent that point west capital s capital investment in allegiance exceeds million 
in addition  net profits of allegiance capital for each calendar year are allocated to point west capital in an amount equal to a return of per annum  compounded monthly  on the amount of its capital contribution  but not in excess of such net profits 
any shortfall is carried forward indefinitely to the next calendar year or years in which net profits are sufficient to make such allocation 
an additional return for each calendar year will be allocated first to point west capital to the extent that in each year sufficient profits are available with no carry forward provided

results of operations by segment viatical settlements the viatical settlements segment includes results of operations in connection with viatical settlements for dpfc and point west capital 
method of accounting for viatical settlements through june   the company used the level yield method to recognize income on life insurance policies 
see the company s form k for a further description thereof 
as a result of the company s decision in to sell all or substantially all of its assets  the company established a reserve for loss on sale of assets during this reserve is reevaluated quarterly 
the reserve for loss on sale of assets was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
in  the company also established a reserve for loss of point west capital s equity interest in dpfc 
by the end of the third quarter of  the reserve was fully depleted 
see certain accounting implications for dpfc 
during  and  the company recognized income with respect to its viatical settlement business upon receipt of proceeds on policies either pursuant to sale of the policy or the death of the insured 
the income is equal to the difference between the policy proceeds less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of the policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on the sale of such policies 
the company also no longer includes  in the carrying value of policies in the consolidated balance sheet  premiums incurred after june   but began expensing these costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
certain accounting implications for dpfc although the securitized notes have a stated maturity of march   the securitized notes were originally expected to be repaid by the fourth quarter of however  at december   million remained outstanding under the securitized notes 
as a result of the substantially delayed collection of dpfc policies  dpfc had a deficit of approximately million at december  if the collection experience for the dpfc policies continues to be substantially delayed  dpfc s deficit will increase for one or more of the following reasons 
first  a decision to discontinue paying premiums on some policies may be made because the present value of the expected death benefit on some policies may be less than expected future premiums to be paid on such policies 
second  the face value of certain policies especially group term may begin to decrease as the people whose lives are insured thereunder reach specified age levels often 
finally  policies for which the insurance was continued under a disability provision may be uneconomical to convert given the insured s age and life expectancy if such insured person is no longer considered disabled 
the company cannot determine at present the extent to which policies held by dpfc will be so affected 
in  the total loss realized by dpfc was million  which was reflected in the company s net income 
in  the total loss realized by dpfc was million  million of which was charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary  and million of which was reflected in the company s net loss 
the average historical quarterly losses in dpfc have been approximately million per quarter over the past four quarters 
upon the retirement of the securitized notes  the company will recognize a gain in an amount approximately equal to any accumulated deficit of dpfc net of any tax effect 
the securitized notes represent the obligations solely of dpfc 
point west capital did not guarantee repayment of the securitized notes and is not required to fund any principal or interest deficiencies thereunder 
potential default by dpfc the company and the noteholders were previously in discussions regarding ongoing responsibilities for the securitized notes and the potential liquidation of dpfc 
however  these discussions have ceased 
if the company and the noteholders do not modify existing obligations and responsibilities for the securitized notes  it appears likely that sometime between march and june there will be insufficient funds available to pay interest on  and other costs associated with  the securitized notes 
such other costs consist primarily of point west capital s monthly servicing fee of  and the reimbursement to point west capital for premiums paid which during and averaged  per month 
the exact point in time that there will be insufficient funds cannot be determined because it is dependent on life insurance policy collections 
based on the liquidity account balance as of february  and on policies collected during february  sufficient funds are available to pay interest on  and a portion of other costs associated with  the securitized notes through february a failure to pay interest under the securitized notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in addition  a failure to pay other costs associated with the securitized notes would  if not cured within days  constitute an event of default under the indenture 
an event of default would give the noteholders the right to accelerate the payment of the securitized notes  foreclose on the policies and dismiss point west capital as the servicer 
in addition  when dpfc is liquidated or the securitized notes are otherwise retired  the company will have income tax liability associated with the gain from debt forgiveness 
the company may be able to utilize the carryforward losses from dpfc to offset such liability  unless the carryforward losses have been previously utilized 
the company does not currently know what actions might be taken or claims might be made by either the noteholders or the company with respect to an event of default or any insufficiency of funds to pay costs associated with the securitized notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  earned discounts 
earned discounts on matured polices decreased to  in from  in  and decreased in from  in the decreases are due primarily to fewer deaths of insureds and secondarily to a decrease in the size of the company s portfolio of life insurance policies 
during  earned discounts on matured policies were recognized on policies with a face value of million  compared to and policies with a face value of million and million in and  respectively 
see method of accounting for viatical settlements 
as of december   the company held policies with an aggregate carrying value of million comprised of purchased life insurance policies and a portion of other assets and an aggregate face value of million 
all of the purchased life insurance policies are pledged as security for the securitized notes 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in from  in  and in from  in  as a result of lower cash balances attributable to dpfc and to lower yields on such cash balances 
dpfc s cash balances are affected by the amount and timing of any policy collections and by the amount and timing of expenses such as interest  trustee fees  premium costs and servicing fees related to its portfolio 
the cash generated by dpfc policy collections is restricted under the indenture 
gain on assets sold 
the gain on assets sold decreased to  in from  in and in from million in the company collected sale proceeds on one policy in compared to seven and policies in and  respectively 
the realized gain was calculated based on the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value after giving effect to the provision for loss on sale of assets 
see cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets 
the company collected a large portion of the sale proceeds from life insurance policies in therefore  there have been and will be minimal if any gains or losses on any policies sold in future periods pursuant to existing agreements 
other income 
components of other income include collections on policies of dividends  interest and paid up cash values  increases in face value of matured policies and refunds of premiums on matured policies 
other income decreased to  in from  in this decrease was due to the face value increase described below and to the decrease in the number and amount of matured policies 
other income increased  in from  in due to a  increase in face value on one policy in and an aggregate of  in paid up cash values on two policies in interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively constant at million in and million in and average borrowings under the securitized notes changed less than million over the past three years 
other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in during the company recorded a historically high premium expense 
the company believes that if the life insurance policies continue to mature slowly  life insurance premium costs are likely to increase in future periods notwithstanding the decrease in see certain accounting implications for dpfc 
other general and administrative expenses increased  in from  in this increase was due primarily to an increase in life insurance policy premium costs 
however  because such premium costs were largely charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary until it was depleted in the third quarter of  the increase had a marginal effect on the company s net income loss relative to provision for loss on assets held for sale 
the company recorded in a provision for loss on sale of assets totaling million 
in  the company recorded an additional provision in the amount of  in connection with the remaining policies not yet sold  based on management s revised best estimate of proceeds from the sale of such policies 
no further provision was considered necessary in or because management believed that the existing provision was adequate

year ended december  compared to year ended december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased to million in from  in this increase was primarily due to  of interest income recognized in as a result of warrants valued using the black scholes option pricing model received in connection with one of ventures loans

net gain loss on securities 
ventures recognized a net gain on securities of million in primarily in connection with the sale of two of its investments 
see income tax 
ventures reviews on a quarterly basis all non marketable securities and attempts to ascertain whether the value is impaired 
as a result of such review  ventures determined that  of non marketable equity securities held of one company was impaired at june  and  of non marketable equity securities held of another company was impaired at december  therefore  ventures wrote off the entire  carrying value of such securities in  which is included in the net gain on securities 
this write off partially offset venture s gain on securities during ventures recognized a net loss on securities of  in primarily because it determined that  of non marketable securities held of one company was impaired at september   and therefore wrote off the entire  carrying value of such security in this write off completely offset venture s  gain on securities during ventures did not recognize any net gain loss on securities in other income 
in  ventures recognized other income of  in connection with a partial recovery of a million investment that was completely written off in and a fee related to one of ventures loans

at december  and the allowance for loan losses was  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses is estimated by management based on a review of the loans and factors which in management s judgement indicate impairment is inherent in the portfolio on the balance sheet date 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
although management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
at december   one loan was in default and on non accrual status 
this loan is not included in the collateral securing the allegiance financing

allegiance had loans outstanding in the aggregate amount of million at december  as compared to five loans and one loan outstanding in the aggregate amount of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on the loans outstanding during was compared to during and the weighted average interest rate is calculated based on the total interest earned for the appropriate period  excluding one loan on non accrual status  divided by the weighted average principal balance outstanding during the appropriate period 
the weighted average interest rate for the period decreased because one loan in the amount of million was delinquent and on non accrual status 
allegiance cannot predict at this time whether the loan will remain on non accrual status 
however  to the extent that the loan does remain on non accrual status  allegiance does not anticipate receiving interest income approximately  per month from such loan 
allegiance has declared an event of default on the delinquent loan and is in the process of taking actions to foreclose on assets securing the loan 
based on a preliminary assessment of the business and operations of the defaulted borrower  allegiance believes it will not incur any loss in connection with such loan

considerations under the investment company act of the investment company act of the act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable generally to investment companies ie  companies engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities within the meaning of the act  whether or not those companies intend to be engaged primarily in such business 
companies that are subject to the act must register with the sec as investment companies and upon registration become subject to extensive regulation 
the company believes  based on its current activities and the nature of its assets  that it should not be deemed to be an investment company because it is not engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities within the meaning of the act and the rules of the sec promulgated thereunder and does not hold itself out as an investment company 
there are also various percentage of assets and income tests the percentage tests and other subjective tests under the act and related rules that are relevant in considering whether a company is deemed to be an investment company 
although the company believes that it should not be deemed to be an investment company  it is possible that it could become one in the near future as a result of the following allegiance has not grown its commercial lending business as quickly as the company had expected  the company has been unable to commence or acquire other complementary financial services businesses as rapidly as it had hoped  the success of ventures  which holds a number of investment securities  has exceeded expectations  the success of other investments by the company has exceeded expectations  and an event of default under the indenture is expected to occur sometime between march and june the majority of investment securities held by the company have been acquired since january the aggregate value of these investments has increased substantially since the purchase dates and the company has realized substantial gains in connection with the sales of some of these investments 
during  ventures sold some of its investments in part to address these issues 
the proceeds of these sales have been invested in us government securities pending final use  which has included further investments by ventures 
the company intends to pursue an aggressive strategy to ensure that it is not deemed to be an investment company 
some elements of this strategy  however  may at least in the short term materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations  or both 
the elements of this strategy  which are subject to the risks described below involve pursuing the growth of new operating businesses  by acquisition or internal development  continuing to develop allegiance s commercial lending business  and continuing to dispose of investment securities and or restricting the growth of ventures business 
although the company intends to continue ventures investment activities  the company does not intend to contribute more capital to ventures 
growth of new operating businesses the company continues to seek advice from financial advisors to assist it in its strategy of developing or acquiring new operating businesses that do not involve investment securities 
although the company intends to pursue businesses which are complementary to the company s current businesses  these businesses may not necessarily involve financial services 
these businesses will be operating entities which do not own  trade or hold any significant amount of investment securities 
the company may not find any suitable businesses to acquire or develop on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  the company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses 
finally  any new businesses may not contribute positively to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
continuing the growth of allegiance the company will use all reasonable efforts to continue to grow the commercial lending business of allegiance 
however  the growth of allegiance is dependent on the market s acceptance of the product offerings and services of allegiance  allegiance s continued ability to raise financing for its activities  allegiance s ability to find suitable creditworthy borrowers and competitive pressures in the lending industry 
at present  allegiance does not have an external funding source beyond april disposing of investment securities limiting growth of ventures the company may determine that it must dispose of additional investment securities to avoid being deemed to be an investment company 
the dispositions may occur at times and on terms that would not maximize the value of these investments 
given the volatile nature of the market  and  in some cases  lack of a market  for some of these investments  sales could occur at severely depressed prices 
in addition  the dispositions may result in disadvantageous tax consequences 
the company intends to use any proceeds of any additional sale to support its working capital including further investments by ventures and may consider using such proceeds to repay sba debt 
pending final use  proceeds of any additional sale will likely be invested in us government securities 
the company also currently intends to limit the growth of ventures business 
although ventures intends to continue investing in investment securities  the company does not intend to contribute more capital to ventures 
limiting ventures growth may materially adversely affect the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
year issue update the company did not experience any significant malfunctions or errors in its operating or business systems when the date changed from to based on operations since january   the company does not expect any significant impact to its ongoing business as a result of the year issue 
however  it is possible that the full impact of the date change  which was of concern due to computer programs that use two digits instead of four digits to define years  has not been fully recognized 
for example  it is possible that year or similar issues such as leap year related problems may occur 
the company believes that any such problems are likely to be minor and correctable 
in addition  the company could still be negatively affected if its borrowers  customers or suppliers are adversely affected by the year or similar issues 
the company currently is not aware of any significant year or similar problems that have arisen for its borrowers  customers and suppliers 
the company incurred year compliance costs of approximately  of which  has been capitalized 
these efforts included replacing some outdated  noncompliant hardware and noncompliant software as well as identifying and remediating year problems

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio 
the company s exposure to market risk arises primarily from the company s investments in the stock of public and private companies  fixed rate loans and debt investments made by allegiance and ventures and allegiance s variable rate debt 
the company s management believes the company s risk management and hedging practices result in carefully managed market exposure 
the company has investment holdings in various companies 
due to the varying nature of these investments  it is difficult to correlate the effects of the market to a particular market index 
the effects of the market are reviewed by management on an individual investment by investment basis 
during the company hedged a position it held in an internet service provider and realized a  gain in connection with such hedging activity 
at december  no such hedges were in place 
however  the company may hedge certain positions in the future 
the table below represents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates for the allegiance loans outstanding at december  thereafter fixed rate loans       average interest rates the principal cash flows for fixed rate loans and average interest rates do not include one delinquent loan 
the company intends to hedge partially with futures contracts its interest rate exposure between the time of origination of the loans and the expected issuance of term certificates under the extension of the allegiance financing 
in connection with the extension of the allegiance financing  point west capital agreed to provide additional cash to allegiance trust i in the event that monthly libor interest rates exceed 
to date point west capital has not been required to make any such payments 
the amount of cash  if any  to be provided will be a function of several variables including the monthly libor interest rate and the outstanding balance of the class a r revolving certificate 
at february  the outstanding balance of the class a r revolving certificate was zero
