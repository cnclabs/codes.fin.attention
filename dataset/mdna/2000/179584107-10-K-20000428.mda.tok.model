discontinued operations in january  the company announced its decision to discontinue the operations of just nikki  inc nikki  a wholly owned subsidiary representing its catalog segment 
the operations of nikki have been accounted for as a discontinued operation in the fiscal consolidated financial statements 
nikki had no significant operations prior to fiscal the company has completed liquidating nikki s inventory and remaining assets during the first half of fiscal impact of inflation inflation has not affected the company  as it has generally been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs through increased sales prices 
year as previously reported  over the past several years the company developed and implemented a plan to address the anticipated impacts of the so called year problem on our information technology it systems and on non it systems 
we also surveyed selected third parties to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
in addition  we developed contingency plans specifying what the company would do if we or important third parties experienced disruptions to critical business activities as a result of the year problems 
the company s year plan was completed in all material respects prior to the anticipated year failure dates 
as of march   the company has not experienced any materially important business disruptions or system failures as a result of year issues  nor is it aware of any year issues that have impacted its suppliers or other significant third parties to an extent significant to the company 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not year compliant 
as of january   the company s total incremental costs historical plus estimated future costs of addressing year issues are estimated to be approximately  of which nearly all has been incurred to date 
these costs were funded through operating cash flow 
for further information regarding year matters  refer to disclosures under forward looking statements below 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company

all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to sales growth and earnings per share growth or statements expressing general optimism about future operating results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
the forward looking statements are and will be based on management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the company s forward looking statements the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities 
competitive product and pricing pressures 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained  profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our earnings and sales growth 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretation and laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials to the company s vendors and the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships 
the ability to achieve earnings forecasts  which are generated based on projected sales of many product types  some of which are more profitable than others 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the projected level or mix of product sales 
the ability to penetrate new markets  which also depends on economic and political conditions 
the ability of the company to successfully integrate the operations of afterthoughts 
the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional programs 
the uncertainties of litigation  as well as other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings 
adverse weather conditions  which could affect customer shopping patterns 
the ability of the company and its suppliers to replace  modify or upgrade computer programs in ways that adequately address the year issue 
changes in consumer preferences for pre teen and teen apparel and fashion accessories 
the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
liquidity and capital resources in connection with the acquisition of afterthoughts  the company entered into the credit facility pursuant to which it financed million of the purchase price 
the credit facility includes a million revolving line of credit which matures on december  and a million five year term loan  the first installment of which is due and payable beginning december  with future installments  thereafter  payable on a quarterly basis through december  the credit facility is prepayable without penalty and bears interest for an initial six months at basis points margin over the london interbank borrowing rate 
the margin is then adjusted periodically based on the company s performance as it relates to certain financial measurements 
company operations have historically provided a strong  positive cash flow which  together with the company s credit facilities  provides adequate liquidity to meet the company s operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  totaled  at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company s current ratio current assets over current liabilities was for fiscal and for fiscal at the end of fiscal  the company increased its investment in inventories to  or  from the fiscal balance of  during this period inventory turnover increased to x from x for fiscal the increase in inventories is due to the company operating  additional stores at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal a increase 
in addition  inventories on a per square foot basis increased 
management believes inventories are appropriate given the increase in the number of stores and the level of sales currently being achieved 
during fiscal  the company continued to expand and remodel its store base 
significant capital projects included the opening and purchase  through acquisition  of  new stores and the remodeling of approximately stores 
funds expended for capital improvements in fiscal totaled  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  as the company continues to invest in its store base and technology 
the company has significant cash balances  a consistent ability to generate cash flow from operations and available funds under its credit facilities 
the company believes that it will be able to maintain its present financial condition and liquidity and be able to finance its capital expenditure plans and other foreseeable future needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated transactions 
based on the company s average net currency positions in fiscal  the potential loss due to a adverse change on foreign currency exchange rates would be expected to be immaterial 
interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to its cash  cash equivalents  debt and short term investment portfolio 
based on the company s average invested cash balances and outstanding debt during fiscal  a decrease in the average effective interest rate in fiscal would not have materially impacted the company s annual net interest income earned 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes new accounting rules for hedging instruments 
in june  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year until fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the impact that sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
