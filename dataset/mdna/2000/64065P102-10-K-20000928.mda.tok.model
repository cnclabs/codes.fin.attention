introduction the company provides software and solutions for the emerging information appliance market 
neoware s software and management tools are designed to power a new generation of smart devices that utilize the benefits of open  industry standard technologies to create new alternatives to a wide variety of proprietary business devices 
neoware s products are designed to run local applications for specific vertical markets  plus allow access across a network to linux servers  the internet and windows based applications running multi user windows servers 
neoware s infrastructure software powers and manages information appliances  which are designed as a new generation of network connected alternatives to proprietary devices and general purpose personal computers  offering the cost benefits of industry standard hardware and software  easier installation  as well as lower up front and administrative costs 
unlike personal computers  the company s products are designed primarily to run applications on a server  not on the desktop 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
year ended june  gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs restructuring charge bridging data technology venture operating loss gain on sale of equity investment interest expense income loss before taxes income tax benefit expense net loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  for the year ended june   net revenues increased by to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net revenues was attributable to increased acceptance of the neostation family of products  as well as initial sales of the company s newer linux based software products 
the company is subject to significant variances in its operating results because of the fluctuations in the timing of the receipt of large orders 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended june   from for the prior fiscal year 
gross profit for the year ended june  includes the impact of a provision for inventory and equipment obsolescence of  in connection with the decision to terminate the designing and manufacturing of proprietary  custom hardware products 
gross profit for the year ended june  includes the impact of a provision for inventory obsolescence of  in connection with the decision to outsource manufacturing activities 
the increase in gross profit  after the foregoing adjustments  is primarily attributable to the effects of the company s new manufacturing strategy as well as to an increase in software sales and consulting services 
the company anticipates that gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter depending on average selling prices  fixed costs in relation to revenue levels and the mix of the company s business  including the percentage of revenues derived from hardware and software 
the gross profit margin also varies in response to competitive market conditions as well as periodic fluctuations in the cost of memory and other significant components 
the market in which the company competes remains very competitive  and although the company intends to continue its efforts to reduce the cost of its products  there can be no certainty that the company will not be required to reduce prices of its products without compensating reductions in the cost to produce its products in order to increase its market share or to meet competitors price reductions 
operating expenses for the year ended june  were  an increase from operating expenses of  in the prior fiscal year as a result of the following sales and marketing expenses increased by  to  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase reflects key personnel additions to sales  marketing and business development in the latter part of the year ended june   as well as higher professional costs  all associated with the beginning of the company s implementation of its growth strategy 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  primarily due to reductions in staffing including the elimination of all hardware engineering staff and in the use of outside consultants and services 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  from  for the year ended june  primarily due to lower professional fees and reduced accruals for uncollectible receivables 
during the year ended june   the company incurred costs of  in connection with a proposed acquisition which was not consummated 
the company realized net interest income of  for the year ended june  compared net interest income of  for the fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to interest earned on the cash generated during the latter part of the year ended june  as a result of exercise of the company s warrants which amounted to approximately  the effective income tax rate was zero for the year ended june  compared to approximately for the year ended june  no income tax benefit was recognized in the and fiscal years as a result of the net operating losses incurred as there is no assurance at this time that the benefit of the net operating loss carryforward will be realized 
during the year ended june   the company recorded income tax expense of  to reserve for a previously recorded deferred tax asset 
for the year ended june   the company s net loss was  as compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
the company s net loss for the year ended june  includes a provision for inventory obsolescence of  an income tax charge of  and no income tax benefit from the net operating loss  offset in part by lower operating expenses and the gain of  on the sale of the company s equity investment in broadreach 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  for the year ended june   net revenues decreased by to  from  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net revenues was attributable to the continued transition to the neostation family of products which have lower selling prices than the older x terminal and network computer products  and the gradual process associated with the full scale implementation of thin client computers by corporate customers subsequent to the deployment of windows nt terminal server edition from microsoft in august and the implementation of year compliant systems by the company s customers 
in addition  sales to two of the company s major customers declined significantly during the fiscal year  as compared to the fiscal year  as a result of completing delivery of product under existing purchase orders 
revenues to such customers are expected to remain at this reduced level for the foreseeable future 
the company is subject to significant variances in operating results because of the fluctuations in the timing of the receipt of large orders 
the company s gross profit percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended june   after the provision for inventory obsolescence of  in connection with the decision to outsource manufacturing activities  from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the inventory adjustment described above as well as fixed overhead representing a higher percentage of revenues in the year ended june  offset by the accelerated writedown of prepaid royalties in the year ended june  the company anticipates that gross margins will vary from quarter to quarter depending on average selling prices  fixed costs in relation to revenue levels and the mix of the company s business  including the percentage of revenues derived from hardware and software 
the gross profit margin also varies in response to competitive market conditions as well as periodic fluctuations in the cost of memory and other significant components 
the market in which the company competes remains very competitive  and although the company intends to continue its efforts to reduce the costs of its products  there can be no certainty that the company will not be required to reduce prices of its products without compensating reductions in the cost to produce its products in order to increase its market share to meet competitors price reductions 
operating expenses for the year ended june  were  a decrease from operating expenses of  in the prior fiscal year 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease reflects the continued restructuring of the domestic and international sales force and reduced commissions attributable to lower revenues 
during fiscal  the company terminated its relationship with its us distributor 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  primarily as a result of the company s completion of the introduction of the neostation family of products in the fiscal year 
the decrease in research and development expenses was accomplished primarily through staffing changes and a substantial reduction in the use of outside consultants and services 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  from  in the year ended june  primarily due to reductions in personnel and professional fees 
the reduction of bdt s expenses as compared to the fiscal year reflects the impact of the agreement which reduced the company s ownership position and eliminated the company s requirement to fund future operations of bdt effective january  the write off reflects the company s evaluation that recovery  if any  of its investments in bdt will not occur 
expenses related to bdt  including the investment write off  have been reclassified as expenses of bdt venture in the company s consolidated financial statements included under item  hereof 
the company realized net interest income of  for the year ended june  as compared to net interest expense of  for the fiscal year 
the decline in interest expense was primarily due to decreased borrowings under the company s line of credit combined with the collection of recoverable income taxes of  and the proceeds of  from the sale of its equity investment in broadreach and the investment of such funds in interest bearing accounts 
the effective income tax rates were approximately as compared to for the year ended june  during the year ended june   the company recorded income tax expense of  to reserve for a previously recorded deferred tax asset 
no income tax benefit was recognized in the fiscal year as a result of the net operating losses incurred during the year as there is no assurance at this time that the benefit of the net operating loss carryforward will be realized 
the tax benefit for the year ended june  reflects recovery of taxes paid in prior years 
for the year ended june   the company s net loss was  as compared to a net loss of  for the prior year 
the company s net loss for the year ended june  includes a provision for inventory obsolescence of  an income tax charge of  and no income tax benefit from the net operating loss  offset in part by reduced operating and interest expenses and the gain of  on the sale of the company s equity investment in broadreach 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had net working capital of  composed primarily of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s principal sources of liquidity include  of cash and cash equivalents and a  line of credit facility with first union national bank  of which  was available as of june  the facility is secured by a first lien security interest in all tangible and intangible personal property of the company and separate pledges of investment property owned by neoware investments  inc and neoware licensing  inc  each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the facility agreement also provides that borrowings under the line will be based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
interest on the line of credit facility accrues at the bank s prime rate plus percent  with interest payable monthly  and all principal and interest is due and payable on december  cash and cash equivalents increased by  during the year ended june   primarily as a result of the exercise of the company s warrants and stock options offset by a loss of  the company used  in cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to generating  during fiscal the decrease in cash generated from operations during fiscal is primarily due to the reduction in accounts receivable and inventories  a provision for inventory obsolescence  and the collection of recoverable income taxes during fiscal year cash flow from operations can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of payments from  and shipments to  large customers 
net cash of  was used in investing activities in fiscal for the purchase of property plant and equipment and capitalized and purchased software 
net cash of  was generated by the exercise of stock options and warrants offset by repayment of the company s line of credit and the issuance of notes receivable 
the company expects to fund current operations and other cash expenditures through the use of available cash  cash from operations  funds available under its credit facility and possible new debt or equity sources 
management believes that there will be sufficient funds from current cash  operations and available financing to fund operations and cash expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  the company must achieve profitable operations in order to provide adequate funding for the long term 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its sales and net revenues during the past three years 
factors affecting the company and future operating results our future results may be affected by industry trends and specific risks in our business 
some of the factors that could materially affect our future results include those described below 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining 
we have recently incurred significant net losses  including net losses of million in the year ended june  in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  we expect to continue to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses 
our expenses increased during the latter part of the fiscal year ended june  reflecting the hiring of additional key personnel and it is anticipated that costs will continue to increase during the year ending june  as we implement our business plan 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or  if we achieve profitability  whether we will be able to sustain it 
if we do not achieve and maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
our financial resources  even with the proceeds raised from the exercise of our common stock purchase warrants  may not be enough for our capital needs  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing 
a failure to derive new revenues from our new business plan would likely increase our losses and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  although our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and we expect our business to be affected by rapid technological change  which may adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
because of the new and rapidly evolving market for our embedded linux and windows based information appliances  our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenues that we will recognize 
in addition  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on historical results  and most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to avoid significantly greater losses 
we do not know whether our business will grow rapidly enough to absorb the costs of these employees and facilities 
as a result  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate 
there are factors that may affect the market acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  including the following the growth and changing requirements of the information appliance market  the quality  price  performance and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability  price  quality and performance of competing products and technologies  and the successful development of our relationships with software providers  original equipment manufacturer customers and existing and potential channel partners 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing our new information appliance products  and our operating results may decline as a result 
our business is dependent on customer adoption of linux and windows based information appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based computer networks and a decrease in their rates of adoption could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues 
we are dependent on the growing use of information appliances to perform discrete tasks for corporate and internet based networks to increase our revenues 
if the role of information appliances does not increase as we anticipate  or if it in any way decreases  our revenues would not materialize 
we believe that our expectations for the growth of the information appliance market may not be fulfilled if customers continue to use general purpose personal computers 
in addition  if corporate information technology organizations do not accept linux based or windows based operating systems  or if there is a wide acceptance of alternative operating systems that provide enhanced capabilities  our operating results could be harmed 
the appliance market in which we seek to compete is new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our revenues may not grow 
in addition  consolidation in this market could result in our clients being absorbed into larger organizations that might not be as receptive to our products 
because some of our products use linux as their operating system  the failure of linux developers to enhance and develop the linux kernel could impair our ability to release major product upgrades and maintain market share 
we may not be able to release major upgrades of our new products on a timely basis because some of our products use linux as their operating system 
the heart of linux  the linux kernel  is maintained by third parties 
linus torvalds  the original developer of the linux kernel  and a small group of independent engineers are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the linux kernel 
if this group of developers fails to further develop the linux kernel or if mr 
torvalds or other prominent linux developers were to no longer work on the linux kernel  we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves 
to date  we have optimized our linux based operating system based on a version of red hat linux 
if we were unable to access red hat linux  we would be required to spend additional time to obtain a tested  recognized version of the linux kernel from another source or develop our own operating system internally 
we cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources 
we could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts  which would increase our development expenses and might delay our product release and upgrade schedules 
in addition  any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional linux based applications for use with our products 
we may not succeed if linux fragments  and application developers do not develop software for our products 
because we depend on sole source  limited source and foreign source suppliers for key components  we are susceptible to supply shortages that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and result in lost sales 
we depend upon single source suppliers for our information appliance products and for several of the components in them 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
we also rely on foreign suppliers which subject us to risks associated with foreign operations such as the imposition of unfavorable governmental controls or other trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and political instability 
we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience shortages of  or difficulties in acquiring  these components 
if we are unable to buy these components  we will not be able to deliver our products to our customers 
because we rely on channel partners to sell our products and anticipate using channel partners to sell our new products  our revenues could be negatively impacted if our existing channel partners do not continue to purchase products from us 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract channel partners that market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
none of our current channel partners is obligated to continue selling our products nor to sell our new products 
we cannot be certain that any channel partner will continue to represent our products or that our channel partners will devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our products in their territories 
we need to expand our direct and indirect sales channels  and if we fail to do so  our growth could be limited 
we do not have a large consulting staff  and our revenues may suffer if customers demand extensive consulting or other support services 
many of our competitors offer extensive consulting services in addition to products 
if we introduced a product that required extensive consulting services for installation and use or if our customers wanted to purchase from a single vendor a menu of items that included extensive consulting services  we would be required to change our business model 
we would be required to hire and train consultants  outsource the consulting services or enter into a joint venture with another company that could provide those services 
if these events were to occur  our future profits would likely suffer because customers would choose another vendor or we would incur the added expense of hiring and retaining consulting personnel 
we may not be able to effectively compete against other providers as a result of their greater financial resources and brand awareness 
in the market for information appliances  we face significant competition from larger companies who have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to continually develop and introduce new products and services with better prices and performance than offered by our competitors  offer a wide range of products  and offer high quality products and services 
if we are unable to offer products and services that compete successfully with the products and services offered by our competitors  our business and our operating results would be harmed 
in addition  if in responding to competitive pressures  we are forced to lower the prices of our products and services and we are unable to reduce our costs  our business and operating results would be harmed 
information appliance products are subject to rapid technological change due to changing operating system software and network hardware and software configurations  and our products could be rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the information appliance market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we do not have any patents and other vendors could challenge our other intellectual property rights 
our products will be differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products  which would harm our operating results 
we may not be able to attract software developers to bundle their products with our information appliances 
our information appliances include our own software  plus software from other companies for specific vertical markets 
if we are unable to attract software developers  and are unable to include their software in our products  we may not be able to offer our information appliances for certain important target markets  and our financial results will suffer 
certain of our products use embedded versions of the windows and linux operating systems 
if we are unable to continue to develop and offer these products to our customers  our sales may decline 
our embedded linux software is based upon the open sourced linux operating system  and we do not expect to retain ownership of our enhancements to this operating system 
the linux operating system is freely available software that is provided under a software license requiring that modifications be made freely available to other software developers 
as a result  we do not intend to attempt to protect the intellectual property related to changes that we make to the linux operating system 
providing these changes to other software developers may allow other companies to offer products which are similar to ours  increasing competition for our products 
in order to grow our revenues  we will need to hire additional personnel  including software engineers 
in order to develop and market our line of information appliances  we must hire additional software engineers as well as marketing and sales personnel 
competition for employees with these skills is severe and we may experience difficulty in attracting suitably qualified people 
any future growth we experience will place a significant strain on our management  systems and resources 
to manage the anticipated growth of our operations  we may be required to improve existing and implement new operational  financial and management information controls  reporting systems and procedures  hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  and establish relationships with additional suppliers and partners while maintaining our existing relationships 
we rely on the services of certain key personnel  and those persons knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace 
our products and technologies are complex and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing personnel  and especially michael kantrowitz  our president and chief executive officer  and edward parks  our vice president of engineering 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business and slow our product development processes 
errors in our products could harm our business and our operating results 
because our information appliance products are complex  they could contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  any of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased maintenance and warranty costs 
these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
product errors or delays could be material  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of new products or the versions of our products that support operating systems other than linux 
occasionally  we have warranted that our products will operate in accordance with specified customer requirements 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with critical distributed computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if our products do not work properly 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any such claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business
