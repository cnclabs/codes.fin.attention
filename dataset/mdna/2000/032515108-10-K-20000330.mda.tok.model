item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we were organized in and initially focused on the development and manufacture of gaas integrated circuits for low volume defense and aerospace applications 
in we began shifting our strategy to focus on radio frequency microwave communications systems for high volume applications  and began production for these applications in in we introduced integrated circuits for cable television 
in late we entered the wireless communications market with the introduction of cellular telephone integrated circuits 
in we expanded our fiber optic product offerings with the introduction of transimpedance amplifiers for the gigabit ethernet market 
in the next few years  we believe there are opportunities to develop integrated circuits in silicon or silicon germanium technology that improves the performance of silicon by improving silicon s electron mobility which would enhance our gaas integrated circuits in modules 
the recently established rf standard products group at anadigics will be exploring the use of these technologies in wireless applications 
we strive to achieve market advantage through the application of our radio frequency microwave design and application knowledge 
with our design expertise we have led the industry with the introduction of innovative products 
recent examples include dual band power amplifiers for use in wireless handsets  cable television qam upconverters and cable television reverse amplifiers  all of which offer greater levels of product performance and reduce original equipment manufacturers production costs 
we aim to achieve cost advantage through the scale and efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
we recently began production in our new six inch analog gaas wafer fabrication facility  which we believe to be the first and only six inch analog gaas wafer fabrication facility in our industry 
using a six inch wafer allows us to produce  at a small incremental cost  more than twice the integrated circuit dice per wafer than can be produced from the industry norm four inch wafer 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling and administrative expense restructuring charges operating income loss interest expense interest income provision for litigation settlement income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss compared to net sales 
net sales during increased to million from million in sales of integrated circuits for cellular and pcs applications increased during to million from million during as demand for our dual band power amplifiers increased 
sales of integrated circuits for cable and broadcast applications increased during to million from million in included in the sales of integrated circuits for cable and broadcast applications are sales of low noise block converter integrated circuits which we ceased production of during the third quarter of of million and million during and  respectively 
the increase in sales of integrated circuits for cable and broadcast applications during was due to increased demand for our integrated circuit chip set  which is used in digital set top converters and cable modems  and our integrated circuit line amplifier  which is used as a repeater in hybrid cable television distribution networks 
sales of integrated circuits for fiber optic telecommunication and data communication applications increased during to million from million in  as demand for our transimpedance amplifiers for synchronous optical network sonet long haul fiber optic telecommunications applications and for high speed gigabit ethernet data communications applications increased 
we expect increased competition from internally sourced silicon integrated circuits at certain of our customers for sonet oc and oc fiber optic transimpedance amplifiers 
increased competition could result in decreased prices of our integrated circuits and or reduced demand for our products 
sales of sonet oc and oc fiber optic transimpedance amplifiers were approximately million during engineering service sales  which reflect customers contributions to research and development  decreased during to million from million in generally  selling prices for same product sales were lower during compared to gross margin 
gross margin during increased to from in excluding accelerated depreciation expense of million  gross margin was during the accelerated depreciation expense was due to a reduction in the useful lives of the fabrication facility equipment and leasehold improvements with original lives ranging from five to twenty years that were reduced to a life of nine months beginning october  the reduction in estimated useful life followed our october decision to close our four inch wafer fabrication facility 
excluding special charges for inventory reserves which were primarily for work in process and finished goods of million substantially all of which was scrapped prior to december  and accelerated depreciation expense of million associated with our october decision to close our four inch wafer fabrication facility  gross margin was during the special charges for inventory reserves consisted of the following million of older generation  single band power amplifier integrated circuits used in cellular applications  million of lnb integrated circuits used in dbs applications  and million of older generation line amplifiers used in catv applications 
anadigics was aggressively attempting to sell these integrated circuits in certain markets primarily secondary communications markets in asia 
we experienced limited success in selling these integrated circuits during and reevaluated our selling efforts and the potential markets for these products during based upon this reevaluation  we decided that we would curtail our efforts to sell these products 
the increase in gross margin during to excluding the accelerated depreciation of million from excluding the special charge for inventory reserves of million and accelerated depreciation expense of million resulted from leveraging fixed costs over higher sales levels during and manufacturing cost structure improvements 
research and development 
anadigics funded research and development expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development of integrated circuits for cellular and pcs  catv  and fiber optic applications  and increased research and development of new process technologies 
as a percent of sales  anadigics funded research and development increased to during from in selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in performance related compensation costs  recruiting and relocation costs  consulting costs  and marketing costs 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased to during from in restructuring charges 
during  we reversed million of a manufacturing restructuring charge recorded during we recorded restructuring charges totaling million during in connection with our plan to lower manufacturing costs and streamline our manufacturing operations 
the restructuring charges consisted of writedowns of impaired assets of million  reductions in force of million  and wafer fabrication facility shutdown and removal costs of million 
writedowns of impaired assets 
we evaluated the on going value of certain assets 
based upon our plan to dispose of certain assets with a carrying amount of million and our estimate of sales value  net of related costs to sell  at million 
the estimated sales value was based on quoted market prices or on the best information available under the circumstances 
in most instances  there was no market for the impaired asset and therefore the fair value was zero 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million  which consisted of the following items write down of assets associated with the conversion of the new wafer fabrication facility from inch to inch wafers write down of assets associated with the closure of the company s in house assembly operations write off of software  in connection with our on going information systems improvements unused production assets previously used in the production of dbs lnb converter integrated circuits total write down on impairment of long lived assets reductions in force 
we recorded charges of million during the first quarter of and million during the fourth quarter of associated with reductions in our workforce 
the workforce reduction charges primarily consisted of severance pay  extended medical coverage  and outplacement service costs for approximately employees primarily involved in our production operations 
approximately million of severance pay  extended medical coverage  and outplacement service costs were paid through the second quarter of for the termination of approximately employees 
as noted above  the remaining liability of million was reversed during the third quarter of facility shutdown and removal costs 
we recorded charges of million associated with the shutdown and removal of our four inch wafer fabrication facility  which is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of interest income  net 
interest income  net increased during to million from million in the increase in interest income  net of million was primarily due to a higher amount of investments during as we received proceeds of million net of related expenses from a common stock public offering completed on november  provision for litigation settlement 
we recorded a provision for litigation settlement of million during the million provision consists of a settlement payment by the company of approximately million in connection with the settlement of the lawsuits referenced in item above  plus other related costs and legal fees 
see part i item legal proceedings 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes during of million  or of income before income taxes 
the provision for income taxes primarily consisted of federal and state income taxes of million at the respective statutory rates  which were partially offset by million of research and experimentation tax credits 
compared to net sales 
net sales during decreased to million from million in net sales consist of product sales and engineering service sales 
net product sales decreased to million in from in engineering service sales  which reflect customers contributions to research and development  decreased during to million from million in sales of integrated circuits for cellular and pcs applications decreased during to million from million during the lower demand was due to several factors  including increased competition  a shift in demand to lower cost phones not using our parts  customer delays in ramp up of new generation dual band phones using our new parts  and in part  to the effect of the asian financial crisis on the wireless communications markets 
sales of integrated circuits for cable and broadcast applications increased during to million from million in the increase in sales of integrated circuits for cable and broadcast applications during was due to increases in demand for our integrated circuits used in digital set top converters and cable modems  and our integrated circuit line amplifier used as a repeater in hybrid fiber coaxial distribution networks 
sales of integrated circuits for fiber optic telecommunication and data communication applications increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for transimpedance amplifiers for synchronous optical network sonet fiber optic telecommunications applications and sales of a new family of integrated circuits for data communication applications 
sales of integrated circuits for direct broadcast satellite applications decreased during to million from million in during the third quarter of  we decided to cease production of our low noise block lnb converter integrated circuits that were used in dbs applications because of reduced demand for lnb converter integrated circuits and the effects of the asian financial crisis 
generally  selling prices for same product sales were lower during compared to gross margin 
gross margin during declined to from in the reduction in gross margin was primarily due to increased inventory reserves totaling million  including a special charge of million substantially all of which was scrapped prior to december  and accelerated depreciation charges related to the planned closing of our existing wafer fabrication facility of million that were recorded during the remaining portion of the reserves recorded during of million which were primarily work in process and finished goods consists of inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory which were recorded based upon our on going inventory analysis during lower factory utilization and higher fixed costs associated with our new test and manufacturing administration facilities placed into service during the second quarter of also contributed to the reduction in gross margin during  compared to research and development 
anadigics funded research and development expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development of integrated circuits for fiber optic and cellular and pcs applications 
as a percent of sales  anadigics funded research and development increased to during from in selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was due in part to executive relocation costs  an increase in operating costs associated with our information systems  and other consulting costs 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to during from in restructuring charges 
in connection with our plan to lower manufacturing costs and streamline our manufacturing operations  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million during the restructuring charges consisted of writedowns of impaired assets of million  reductions in force of million  and wafer fabrication facility shutdown and removal costs of million 
interest income  net 
interest income  net decreased during to million from million in the reduction in interest income  net of million was primarily due to a lower amount of investments during  caused by plant and equipment purchases that were primarily for our new wafer fabrication facility 
benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes during of million  or of the loss before income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes primarily related to the federal and state net operating losses  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits  all of which we plan to carry forward 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
included in these amounts are proceeds we received from completion of a public offering of common stock in november  which raised million  net of related expenses 
we had million of bank debt outstanding as of december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in  which effectively fixes the interest rate on this portion of the credit facility at 
the swap effectively changed the variable interest rate of this bank debt to a fixed rate for which the present value of the cash flow is approximately the same 
as of december   we also had million available under a term loan facility 
the term loan facility drawdown period expires on july  the outstanding bank debt and the term loan facility are subject to certain financial covenants 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as security for repayments of the outstanding bank debt and borrowings  if any  under the term loan facility 
operations generated million in cash during investing activities  consisting of purchases of equipment of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million  used million of cash during financing activities raised million during cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds received from completion of a public offering of common stock in november  which raised million  net of related expenses as noted above 
as previously planned and disclosed  we ceased our wafer fabrication operations in our four inch wafer fabrication facility during the third quarter of fabrication facility dismantling and restoration activities began late in the fourth quarter of we plan to continue dismantling the facility during the first quarter of and restoring these areas as office space by the end of the first half of in december  we entered into an agreement to expand our six inch production facility 
the expansion  which is expected to cost approximately million  will approximately double our current production capacity and is expected to be completed by june  in addition to the above  at december   we also committed to purchase approximately million of equipment and furniture  and leasehold improvements during the first half of we believe that our sources of capital  including internally generated funds and million available under our million existing credit facility  will be adequate to satisfy anticipated capital needs for the next twelve months and beyond 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  or investments in other companies 
however  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
to address the year issue  we formed a senior team of internal staff and outside consultants to ensure that the year issue did not have an adverse effect on our core business operations 
to accomplish this  we invested approximately million in new computer hardware and software and million in assessment development and remediation efforts in and to ensure that our information technology systems  non information technology systems  and manufacturing equipment were year compliant 
we have completed our remediation and testing procedures and to date  we have not experienced any disruptions in our business due to year compliance problems 
however  it is possible that certain of our systems  or systems of our customers or vendors may fail to operate in the year to the extent we experience year related issues in the future  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely effected 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the statement permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after its issuance 
we expect to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our credit facility and our investments in certain available for sale securities 
to date  we have managed our exposure to changes in interest rates from our credit facility by entering into interest rate swap agreements which allow us to convert our debt from variable to fixed interest rates 
we plan to continue to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates from our credit facility by using interest rate derivative instruments 
our available for sale securities consist of fixed income investments us treasury and agency securities and short term commercial paper 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates from our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected
