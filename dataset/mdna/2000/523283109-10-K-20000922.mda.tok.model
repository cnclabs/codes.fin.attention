general hallmark capital corp 
the company is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of wisconsin and is engaged in the financial services business through its wholly owned subsidiary  west allis savings bank the bank  a wisconsin state chartered stock savings bank headquartered in milwaukee  wisconsin 
the company s initial public offering was consummated in december  and the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of the bank issued in the mutual to stock conversion of the bank the conversion on december  the company s primary strategy since the conversion through fiscal has been to focus on effectively utilizing the capital acquired in the conversion to fund asset growth and asset portfolio diversification into higher yielding assets 
this strategy resulted in an increase in the company s asset size from million at june  to million at june  the company s asset growth has come primarily through i the origination and purchase of mortgage loans principally loans secured by one to four family owner occupied homes within and outside of the company s primary lending area  ii the purchase of mortgage backed and related securities  and iii the origination and purchase of commercial real estate and business loans within and outside of the company s primary lending area 
this asset growth was funded through significant increases in federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowings  and increases in deposits consisting primarily of brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits 
the company s asset portfolio diversification has been achieved by altering the composition of loans and securities originated  purchased  sold and held in the total asset portfolio 
in particular  the company has focused on originating and purchasing higher yielding non conforming one to four family  multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loans secured by properties or assets located within the company s primary lending area as defined herein and outside of the company s primary lending area  to either replace or supplement lower yielding one to four family mortgage loans and principal run off from the mortgage securities portfolio 
in fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans or participation interests loan production totaling million and million  respectively  total loan production of million as compared to fiscal when originated and purchased loans and participation interests totaled million and million  respectively total loan production of million 
approximately million and million of the company s total loan production related to properties or business assets located outside of the company s primary lending area in fiscal and  respectively representing and of gross loans at june  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the company s loan production in related to multi family and construction loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial construction and land loans and commercial business loans 
the company has substantially completed its strategy of utilizing the capital acquired in the conversion to fund asset growth and asset portfolio diversification into higher yielding assets 
in fiscal  the company does not intend to significantly grow in asset size from its current level of million 
under fdic regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the bank must maintain certain amounts and ratios of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations in order to maintain its status as a well capitalized institution 
as of june   the bank was fully leveraged from a risk based capital standpoint  with a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of with a required ratio of 
see note to the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
therefore  in fiscal  in order to maintain its well capitalized status  the bank will only be able to increase its asset base to the extent of net retained earnings 
the company intends to continue to maximize the yield on its loan portfolio in fiscal by maintaining the portfolio percentage composition of higher yielding non conforming one to four family  multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loans and selling substantially all of its current year lower yielding one to four family mortgage loans originated 
the company projects that total loan production will be approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
the company anticipates that approximately half of its total loan production in fiscal will be generated from the purchase of loans secured by properties located outside of its primary market area 
a significant portion of out of market purchases are expected to relate to non conforming one to four family mortgage loans  multi family and commercial real estate loans 
the company intends to evaluate the benefits of converting the bank from a state thrift charter to a state bank charter in under regulations established for state savings banks by the wisconsin department of financial institutions dfi  the bank is limited in the amount of commercial real estate and commercial business loans it can hold in its loan portfolio 
the dfi approved limit for the bank was of the bank s total asset base at june  and june  at june   the bank had million of such loans in its portfolio  representing of the bank s total asset base of million 
at june   the bank had million of such loans in its portfolio  representing of the bank s asset base of million 
the company projects that the percentage of total assets represented by commercial real estate and commercial business loans will not increase significantly in fiscal as a substantial portion of these new originations and purchases are expected to be sold in the secondary market 
thus  while management believes that this current regulatory limit is currently sufficient to meet the bank s business strategy in fiscal  the company intends to evaluate whether a state bank charter would provide more lending flexibility 
the company intends to begin the process of increasing the level of core retail deposits relative to brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits which is expected to reduce the overall cost of liabilities for the company 
this process will begin in fiscal through the use of several different strategies  including changing the bank name from west allis savings bank to ledger bank  ssb  opening a new full service banking center in glendale  wisconsin  implementing a proactive internal sales culture  and by offering an internet only deposit product 
the company intends to enhance its presence in the marketplace by changing its bank name from west allis savings bank to ledger bank  ssb during the second quarter of fiscal the new name  ledger bank  ssb  was strategically selected to pay tribute to the bank s year old heritage as a trustworthy  solid community bank and to act as a vehicle to demonstrate the bank s commitment to future growth 
the company believes the new name will enable it to create a differentiated  customer focused  financial services brand in the market 
the new name will become official on october   the day following the company s annual meeting of shareholders  with a local media and promotional campaign 
the company believes the new name will help enhance the bank s growth plans to increase its market share around each current branch office  opening a new full service banking center as well as the ongoing sales efforts of its residential lending officers and business loan officers throughout southeastern wisconsin 
the company intends to support the new name and enhanced brand identity through increased marketing expenditures in fiscal a new full service banking center in glendale  wisconsin is expected to be operating during the third quarter of fiscal this north shore location currently serves as the executive and administrative headquarters for the company and bank 
location specific market research was conducted during fiscal by a third party company  placing this site as one of the top five locations for attracting core deposit balances in milwaukee county 
the full service banking center will offer traditional deposit products and services  discount brokerage services  and mortgage  consumer and commercial business lending services 
the company expects to incur significant non interest expenses in connection with opening the new banking center 
during fiscal  the company also intends to generate additional non interest income from existing and new revenue sources 
this is expected to be accomplished by i continuing to generate commercial lending and deposit activities through the commercial lending division  ii increasing fee income opportunities within the residential mortgage lending division through the sale of one to four family mortgage loans and referral of subprime mortgage loans  iii increasing fees from its insurance subsidiary  hallmark planning services  inc  and iv expanding commercial mortgage banking activities during fiscal in fiscal  the company intends to continue pursuing commercial lending activities through its commercial banking division as another source of additional fee income and higher yielding assets 
the focus of the company s commercial division will be the origination and purchase of small business loans and leases  as well as the acquisition of business deposits 
during fiscal  the company originated and purchased million of multi family  commercial real estate  multi family construction  commercial construction and commercial business loans  lines of credit and leases  of which million were purchases and were originations 
management currently projects that the commercial lending division will significantly decrease its origination and purchase activity by approximately during fiscal in order to maintain a minimal growth rate in the company s asset base 
the company also expects increased fee income from the commercial banking division resulting from a growth in business deposit relationships 
the company also has recently implemented a program for mortgage contract cash processing within the commercial lending division  a service which generates fee income 
through the program  the bank acts as a partial sub servicer  providing a cash processing function for nationally originated commercial real estate loans 
during fiscal  the company also intends to increase its non interest income by expanding the secondary marketing activities of its residential mortgage division  generating additional fee income through the sale of mortgage credit and life insurance  and through the referral of subprime mortgage loans to a third party lender 
the company expects one to four family mortgage loan originations to increase despite the generally higher level of market interest rates due to increased marketing activities and expansion of our retail banking centers 
it is currently anticipated that substantially all of the year fixed rate conforming one to four family mortgage loans originated in fiscal will be sold in the secondary market resulting in income from gains on loans sold 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued its lending activities involving higher credit risk financial services also known as subprime lending through hallmark financial  inc d b a major finance 
major finance was formed to broker subprime loans primarily secured by one to four family mortgage and commercial real estate within and outside the company s primary lending area 
management discontinued the operations of major finance due to the lack of loan production to cover the costs of engaging in this lending activity 
no loans originated by major finance are currently in the bank s portfolio 
it is anticipated that the company s subprime lending activities in fiscal will be limited to referring subprime loan prospects to third party lenders through the residential mortgage lending division and generating referral fee income from such activity 
the company expects its insurance subsidiary  hallmark planning services  inc  to generate additional fee income in fiscal from the sale of securities  mutual funds  annuities and life insurance products by licensed investment brokers 
the company attributes the projected growth in fee income to the overall business strategy of adding a new retail banking center and the implementation of a proactive sales culture in fiscal during fiscal  the company also intends to generate non interest income by leveraging its existing commercial lending capabilities through the origination  selling and servicing of commercial real estate mortgages on a national basis  with primary concentration in the southwest and western regions of the country 
while the company primarily expects to originate and purchase commercial real estate mortgages on a national basis  it also may originate and purchase loans or participation interests in loans secured by multi family real estate and commercial business assets 
the new commercial mortgage banking operation  hallmark financial  inc hfi  will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
hfi will originate loans from a third party commercial real estate broker on a non exclusive basis and act as the lender of record until the loan is sold without recourse  generally within days of the loan closing 
hfi will retain the servicing rights to these loans and receive a servicing fee 
the company estimates that during fiscal hfi will originate  sell and service approximately million of commercial real estate mortgage loans on a national basis  with primary concentration in the southwest and western regions of the country 
hfi revenues  generated primarily through the collection of originating and servicing fees  are projected to be approximately   in fiscal the primary benefit of the expansion of the bank s commercial lending activities is to gain economies of scale through the ability to leverage existing staff  expertise level  overhead and infrastructure in order to increase fee income without a significant incremental increase in expenses 
the company expects to incur significant increases in non interest expense as a result of implementing its strategic business plan in fiscal in addition  the company s negative interest rate gap position at june  will likely reduce net income in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
to mitigate the company s exposure to rising interest rate levels  the company intends to decrease its negative interest rate gap position by lengthening the maturities of its wholesale funding sources wholesale brokered cds and fhlb advances 
the company also may implement hedging strategies involving derivative financial instruments such as options and interest rate swaps during fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition asset liability management 
as a result of the projected expense increases and narrowing of interest margin due to the gap position and the generally higher level of interest rates  the company expects net income in fiscal to fall below reported net income for despite the projected decline in net income  the company believes the strategic benefits of the expanded sales and branch activities will have a long term positive impact on the company s results of operations and franchise value

interest income on non accrual loans is reflected in the period it is collected and not in the period it is earned 
such amounts are not material to net interest income or net change in net interest income in any period 
non accruing loans are included in the average balances and do not have a material effect on the average yield

net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the company s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of  and rates earned or paid on  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods

 financial condition total assets increased million or  from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily reflected in increases in loans receivable and interest bearing deposits consistent with the company s strategy of moderate asset growth and asset portfolio diversification 
the increase was funded primarily by an increase in wholesale brokered deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and decreases in securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase is largely attributable to the increase in wholesale brokered deposits and decreases in securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
securities available for sale decreased to million at june  compared to million at june  the decrease is the result of management s decision to sell securities available for sale and increase its investment into higher yielding loans 
at june   the securities available for sale portfolio contained million of fixed rate us government agency securities  million of agency and private issue fixed rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of private issue adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of fixed rate intermediate term tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aaa  million of floating rate tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aa  million in trust preferred securities  million of adjustable rate mortgage mutual funds and  of municipal bonds 
mortgage backed and related securities held for investment decreased to million at june  compared to million at june  the decrease is the result of management s decision to decrease its investment in mortgage backed and related securities to provide funding for the loan portfolio growth and diversification 
of the million in mortgage backed and related securities at june   all were fixed rate  compared to a total of million at june   of which million were adjustable rate and million were fixed rate 
at june   million of the mortgage backed and related securities portfolio consisted of private issue mortgage backed and related securities  each issue of which carried a minimum investment rating of aa at the time of purchase and at june  the decrease in mortgage backed and related securities was primarily attributable to the transfer of million to trading and securities available for sale of which million was sold to fund higher yielding loans 
loans receivable increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase at june  compared to the prior fiscal year end is primarily the result of management s decision to retain more fixed rate loans originated and purchased for the company s portfolio  as such loans carried higher yields than comparable mortgage backed and related securities in fiscal total mortgage loans originated and purchased amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  while sales of fixed rate mortgage loans totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in fixed rate mortgage loan sales is primarily attributable to the increased interest rate environment during fiscal that decreased the level of loans refinanced 
during fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively 
of the million in purchased loans  the company purchased million outside of its primary lending area  whereby management of the company has applied underwriting guidelines which are at least as strict as those applicable to the origination of similar loans within its primary lending area 
deposits increased million to million at june  from million at june  the increase in deposits was primarily due to the company s use of brokers and marketing efforts to increase the certificates of deposit with the company 
brokered deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  the significant increase in brokered deposits is due to attractive rates offered on the brokered deposits and the company s highly competitive local market for retail deposits resulting in increasing reliance on brokered deposits as a funding source 
the average maturity of brokered deposits was four months at june  and june  non brokered wholesale deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits  as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  deposits are the company s primary source of externally generated funds 
the level of deposits is heavily influenced by such factors as the general level of short and long term interest rates as well as alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investment securities such as money market mutual funds 
fhlb chicago advances and other borrowings increased to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   fhlb advances were million  or of total liabilities  compared to million  or of total liabilities at june  borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the company has increasingly used fhlb chicago advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a funding source due to attractive rates offered on advances in relation to deposit funds obtainable in the company s local market 
the company uses borrowings from the fhlb chicago and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to manage the total asset liability portfolio of the company 
for a further discussion of fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are retail and wholesale brokered deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on mortgage backed and related securities and fhlb chicago advances 
alternative funding sources are evaluated and utilized based upon factors such as interest rates  availability  maturity  administrative costs and retention capability 
although maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and prepayments on mortgage backed and related securities are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
during fiscal mortgage loans and mortgage securities prepayments decreased as interest rates increased as compared to fiscal and when mortgage loans and mortgage securities prepayments increased as interest rates declined 
the primary investing activity of the company is the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and related securities 
for fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal when originated and purchased loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the company purchased mortgage backed and related securities in the amount of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company also purchased investment securities in the amount of and  during fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal and  these activities were funded primarily by principal repayments on loans of million and million  respectively  principal repayments on mortgage backed and related securities of million and million  respectively  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans of million and million  respectively  proceeds from maturity of investment securities of and  respectively  proceeds from notes payable to the fhlb chicago of million and million  respectively  and a net increase in deposits of million and million  respectively 
purchases of securities available for sale totaled million and sales were million for fiscal  compared to purchases of million and sales of million for fiscal during fiscal  the company has found wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits to be an efficient source and a cost effective method  relative to local retail market deposits  of meeting the bank s funding needs 
in fiscal  pricing of wholesale brokered deposits ranged from to basis points above comparable term us treasury securities 
at june   the average rate of the wholesale brokered deposits accepted by the company was compared to an average rate paid for retail certificates of deposit of 
management believes that the strategy of leveraging the capital acquired in the conversion to achieve the targeted asset size established by the board of directors within a three to five year period following the conversion  could not have been achieved solely through the use of retail deposits from the local market 
management also believes that the costs  overhead and interest expense of achieving comparable retail deposit growth would have exceeded the costs related to the use of wholesale brokered deposits as a funding source 
however  management recognizes that the likelihood for retention of brokered certificates of deposit is more a function of the rate paid on such accounts as compared to retail deposits which may be established due to bank location or other intangible reasons 
during fiscal  the company maintained a total of million in federal fund lines with two large correspondent banks 
these lines are to be used as backup credit facilities for contingency purposes to replace funds from wholesale brokered deposits should retention of those deposits diminish due to extraordinary events in the financial markets 
the company s overall cost of funds has increased in recent years due primarily to a much greater percentage of the deposits being in certificates  both wholesale brokered and retail  as opposed to passbooks  money market accounts and checking accounts 
management believes that a significant portion of its retail deposits will remain with the company and  in the case of wholesale brokered deposits  may be replaced with similar type accounts even should the level of interest rates change 
however  in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates  the cost of obtaining replacement brokered deposits would increase as well 
the bank s board of directors has set a maximum limitation of total borrowings equal to of total assets 
this internal limit is below the allowable borrowing limit for all borrowings including fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements of of total assets established by the fhlb chicago 
at june   fhlb advances and borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements totaled million  or of the bank s total assets 
at june   the bank had unused borrowing authority under the borrowing limitations established by the board of directors of million and million under the fhlb total asset limitation 
the bank intends to fund asset growth in fiscal through modest increases in fhlb advances  and to maintain the excess borrowing capacity with the fhlb as a contingent source of funds to meet liquidity needs as deemed necessary by the board of directors of the bank 
during fiscal  management maintained the maturities of both its wholesale brokered certificates of deposits and the fhlb borrowings to increase net interest income 
as of june   the average maturity of the wholesale brokered certificates of deposit was four months compared to five months in fiscal and compared to a ten month maturity for retail certificates of deposits as of june  the company is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets under the regulations of the department of financial institutions  division of savings and loan for state chartered savings banks 
savings banks are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  certain bankers acceptances  certain corporate debt securities  securities of certain mutual funds and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations of not less than since april  and prior to that date 
the company s liquidity ratios were and at june  and  respectively 
the company adjusts its liquidity levels to meet various funding needs and to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include investments in highly liquid  short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in deposits 
liquidity management for the company is both an ongoing and long term function of the company s asset liability management strategy 
excess funds generally are invested in short term investments such as federal funds or overnight deposits at the fhlb chicago 
whenever the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available and obtained from the wholesale brokered and non brokered market as well as the unused credit line from the fhlb chicago subject to the board imposed and regulatory limitations discussed herein  and funds also may be available through reverse repurchase agreements wherein the company pledges investment  mortgage backed or related securities 
the company maintains a federal funds open line of credit in the amount of million with a correspondent bank which does not require the direct pledging of any assets and could be used to replace a portion of its interest rate sensitive liabilities such as borrowings and deposits should such funding sources become difficult to obtain or retain due to an adverse interest rate environment 
in addition  the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets  such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  in order to insure sufficient sources of funds are available to meet the company s liquidity needs 
at june   the company had outstanding loan commitments of million 
the company had no commitments to purchase securities and mortgage backed and related securities at june  the company anticipates it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments  including loan applications received and in process to the issuance of firm commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at june  totaled million 
impact of year the company believes it has adequately addressed the year issue 
the company identified areas of computer and other operations critical for the delivery of its loan and deposit products 
the majority of the company s applications used in operations were purchased from outside vendors 
the vendors providing the software were responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after december  the company s plan included obtaining certification of compliance from third parties and testing all of the impacted applications both internally developed and third party provided 
testing of the system and conversion activities were completed as of june  there are no mission critical systems which are non compliant 
the company developed and finalized contingency plans for any adverse situations that may have arisen related to year the company s plan also included reviewing any potential risks associated with loan and deposit data base information due to the year issue 
subsequent to january   all computer systems continue to function as expected and have not affected the ability of the company to deliver its products and services to date 
management will continue to monitor computer systems for problems and errors associated with their operation 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that the cost to address the year issues did not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
direct expenditures for the twelve months ended june  and june  totaled  and  respectively 
direct expenditures include capital expenditures for compliant equipment and software  write offs of non compliant equipment and software upgrades 
the expenditures will be funded by increases in the company s non interest expense budget 
the company also made inquiries and reviewed plans of certain third parties  such as commercial loan customers  where year failures could have resulted in significant adverse impact on the company 
the company had completed the inquiry and review process and was satisfied the bank would not be subject to significant adverse impact 
based on information available  the bank has not experienced any difficulties with third parties related to the year issue 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance 
asset liability management the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  depends to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the company is required to pay higher rates to attract deposits which can result in a decline in net interest income if the company is unable to increase the yield on its interest earning assets sufficiently to compensate for the increase in its cost of funds 
in an attempt to manage vulnerability to interest rate changes  management closely monitors the company s interest rate risk 
the company has established its investment strategies through an asset liability committee 
the committee consists of james smessaert  president ceo  peter gilbert  executive vice president coo  arthur thompson  senior vice president finance cfo  and elizabeth borst  senior vice president sales marketing 
the committee generally meets weekly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position  maturing securities and borrowings  interest rates and programs for increasing retail and brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits and originating and purchasing loans  and develops strategies regarding such issues 
in addition  the committee closely monitors the company s growth  profitability  liquidity and capital adequacy ratios 
minutes of these meetings are prepared and given to the board of directors for their review as well as formal quarterly asset liability management and investment strategy reports 
the company utilizes basic strategies in managing its assets and liabilities by managing or maximizing the net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
in addition to monitoring interest rate risk on a weekly basis  the company reviews loan and deposit rates weekly 
the emphasis has been on prudent pricing as opposed to increasing local retail market share  and the company has significantly supplemented and substituted retail deposits using fhlb chicago advances and wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits in fiscal and as a result of favorable advance and wholesale rates in relation to those obtainable on retail deposits also  during fiscal hedging techniques through the use of interest rate caps were utilized by management with the approval of the board of directors to manage the interest rate risk on the company s short term wholesale certificates of deposit 
generally  the company utilizes the following strategies to manage its interest rate risk i the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets  such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  ii the company seeks to primarily originate and retain mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities with short to medium term periods to re pricing  iii the company attempts to extend the maturities of retail deposits when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit with longer terms  and periodically utilizes deposit marketing programs offering maturity and repricing terms structured to complement the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing asset liability mix  iv the company also attempts to extend the maturities of wholesale brokered deposits when deemed cost effective  v the bank utilizes longer term borrowings from the fhlb chicago and reverse repurchase agreements to manage its assets and liabilities and enhance earnings 
at june   and  total fhlb chicago advances and borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements were million or of total assets  million or of total assets  and million or of total assets  respectively  and vi the company also periodically reviews the pricing of hedging strategies such as options and interest rate swaps as a way to manage it s interest rate risk exposure 
prior to january   most of the company s wholesale brokered and non brokered certificates of deposits had day initial maturities and  as of june   the average maturity was four months 
during the fiscal year ended june   management maintained the maturity level fixed rate term advances from the fhlb chicago to between one to five years 
liquidity is another factor in asset liability management 
as of june   the company had million in cash or demand deposits and million in its available for sale portfolio  of which million is due or will be repriced within one year 
the amount of the held to maturity portfolio as of june  was million  of which  will be due or repriced within one year 
during fiscal  the company increased its interest rate risk by funding fixed rate loan assets with shorter term wholesale deposits and borrowings 
the increase was due to the increase in fixed rate lending combined with an interest rate environment during fiscal that led to a decrease in the early repayment of fixed rate loans 
however  because of the relative liquidity of mortgage backed and related securities  the company can restructure its interest earning asset portfolios more quickly and effectively in a changing interest rate environment 
the company s arm loans and arm mortgage backed and related securities typically have annual and lifetime interest rate caps which reduce their ability to protect the company against a prolonged and significant increase in interest rates 
mortgage backed and related securities are subject to reinvestment risk 
for example  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage backed and related securities are more likely to prepay  and the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from prepayments in securities or other assets with yields similar to those of the prepaying mortgage backed and related securities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it matures or reprices within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
at june  and  total interest bearing liabilities repricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing assets repricing in the same period by million and million  respectively  representing a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap equal to and  respectively  of total assets 
the increase in the company s negative one year gap reflects the increased use of shorter term maturity wholesale deposits and borrowings to fund fixed rate mortgage loans 
during periods of rising interest rates  a positive interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to positively affect net interest income while a negative interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in addition to the potentially adverse effect on net interest income resulting from increasing interest rates due to the company s one year gap position  the company could experience a substantial decrease in prepayments of its fixed rate mortgage loans with rising interest rates  which may result in a lower level of proceeds available for reinvestment 
in addition to measuring the interest rate risk as a static gap measurement  the company also measures the impact on interest income with an instantaneous increase or decrease of interest rates of   and basis points 
this shock analysis is performed quarterly 
a third measurement is used whereby interest rates are ramped over a one year time frame with increases and decreases of   and basis points 
management continues to upgrade its modeling techniques related to asset liability modeling 
results of the gap  shock and ramped interest risk analysis are reviewed by the board of directors 
in fiscal  the company intends to extend the weighted average maturity level of its fixed rate liabilities  including fhlb borrowings and certificates of deposit  to decrease its exposure to rising interest rates 
management anticipates that the effect of funding the origination and purchase of an increasing portfolio of multi family real estate  multi family construction and commercial nonresidential loans with such liabilities will be to lessen the company s negative gap position 
also  the origination and purchase of such assets normally carry more desirable interest rate repricing features as compared to the company s experience with one to four family mortgage lending 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities in the company s portfolios could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
asset liability management schedule the following table sets forth at june  the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the time periods indicated  based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes thereto

balances have been reduced for undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned credit insurance premiums  deferred loan fees  purchased loan discounts and the allowance for loan losses  which aggregated million at june  although the company s negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts generally are subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a certain historical amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities and times to repricing based on the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are assumed to be withdrawn at annual rates of  and  respectively  of the declining balance of such accounts during the period shown 
the withdrawal rates used are higher than the company s historical rates but are considered by management to be more indicative of expected withdrawal rates currently 
if all of the company s now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts had been assumed to be subject to repricing within one year  the one year cumulative deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities would have been million or of total assets 
adjustable and floating rate borrowings are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company generally has not entered into futures  forwards  swaps or options but has decided to purchase interest rate caps to manage the interest rate risk on the company s short term wholesale certificates of deposit 
the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the company
