however  the company minimizes its credit risk by dealing with only major international banks and financial institutions 
other financial instrument risk disclosures the carrying values of the company s long term debt and other financial instruments approximated their estimated fair values at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements at december  
the company s convertible subordinated notes with a principal balance of million at december  mature in june and the fair value of this debt has been estimated to approximate its carrying value due to the relatively short time until maturity and the provision that the company can redeem this debt at any time at par value 
the fair value of borrowings under the pollution control bonds and the company s cross border credit facility have been estimated to approximate their carrying values as these instruments bear interest at prevailing market rates 
the canadian dollar denominated borrowings under the cross border credit facility are held by the company s canadian subsidiaries whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
therefore the reported liability balance  as expressed in the us dollar reporting currency of homestake  will fluctuate as the canadian to us dollar exchange rate changes
