impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food and labor costs 
a large number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at federal and state established minimum wage levels and  accordingly  changes in such wage levels affect the company s labor costs

to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents a summary of the company s cash flows for the years ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investment activities    net cash provided used by financing activities    net effect of exchange rate changes on cash  net decrease in cash and cash equivalents    during the fiscal years ended  and  the company s purchases of property and equipment were   and  respectively 
the company has opened restaurants in the past three fiscal years of which opened during  in and in the company does not have significant accounts receivable or inventory and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
because funds available from cash sales are not needed immediately to pay for food and supplies  or to finance inventory  they may be considered as a source of financing for capital expenditures 
at december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
while the company plans to finance its future expansion from operating cash flows  it believes it could establish a credit facility on suitable terms  if the need were to arise 
the company is not actively negotiating purchase or lease of additional sites 
during and  the board of directors has authorized the company to purchase shares of the company s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the authorization in was for  shares of common stock and in for  shares of common stock 
pursuant  to the authorizations  the company purchased  shares of common stock during fiscal and  shares of common stock in fiscal on january   the board of directors approved an authorization to purchase up to an additional  shares subject to certain conditions 
beginning in the fourth quarter of the company began utilizing derivative financial instruments in the form of commodity futures contracts to manage market risks and reduce its exposure resulting from fluctuations in the prices of meat 
the company uses live beef cattle futures contracts to accomplish its objective 
realized and unrealized changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument are recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for the period have not been significant 
at december  the company s exposure for open positions in futures contracts were not significant 
in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft as a proposed interpretation accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

the proposal  among other things  would require that certain modifications as to outstanding stock options to a direct change to the exercise price repricings or the number of shares or an indirect change to the exercise price or number of shares sometimes referred to as synthetic pricings must be accounted for using variable award accounting 
the fasb interpretation  when adopted  will require compensation accounting for all awards for which share repricings or synthetic pricings occurred after december  compensation expense is to be recognized only to the extent that the market price of the stock exceeds the stock price on the date of the issuance of the fasb interpretation and increases thereafter  consequently  the last measurement of compensation expense would occur at the date the options are exercised 
the company has repriced approximately  option shares during fiscal and in january  which will be subject to the proposed interpretation when it becomes effective 
currently  the proposed effective date is july  the company may incur significant volatility in reporting of earnings in future periods as fluctuations in market prices of its common stock may greatly impact reported compensation expense on periodic basis 
risk factors if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors we will not be able to increase revenues or generate profits 
our inability to increase revenues is directly related to our ability to compete effectively with our competitors 
key competitive factors include the quality and numbers of high quality employees needed to adequately staff our restaurants  the quality and value of the food products offered  the quality of service  the price of the food products offered  the restaurant locations  and the ambiance of facilities we compete with other steakhouse restaurants specifically and with all other restaurants generally 
we compete with national and regional chains  as well as individually owned restaurants 
the restaurant industry has few non economic barriers to entry  and as our competitors expand operations  competition from steakhouse restaurants with concepts similar to ours can be expected to intensify 
many of our competitors are well established in the upscale and mid scale steak segments and certain competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
such increased competition could adversely affect our revenues 
unforeseen cost increases could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food  labor and other operating costs 
our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh food supplies means that shortages or interruptions in supply could materially and adversely affect our operations 
in addition  unfavorable trends or developments concerning the following factors could adversely affect our results inflation  food  labor and employee benefit costs  and rent increases resulting from rent escalation provisions in our leases 
we may be unable to anticipate or react to changing prices 
if we are unable to modify our purchases practices or quickly or readily pass on increased costs to customers  our business could be materially affected 
failure to comply with government regulations could adversely affect our operating performance 
our restaurant operations are subject to certain federal  state and local laws and government regulations  such as the obtaining of licenses for the sale of food and alcohol beverages  national and local health sanitation laws and regulations  national and local employment and safety laws and regulations  and local zoning  builing code and land use regulations 
while we have never experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining necessary governmental approvals  the failure to obtain or retain food and liquor licenses or any other governmental approvals could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be subjected to dram shop liability  which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person with the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person 
although we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance 
and have never been named as a defendant in a lawsuit involving dram shop statues  if we lost a lawsuit related to this liability  our business could be materially harmed 
the restaurant industry is affected by a number of trends  as well as by competition 
the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
in addition  factors such as inflation  increased food  labor and employee benefit costs and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the restaurant industry in general and our restaurants in particular 
our business depends on a limited number of key personnel  the loss of whom could adversely affect us 
some of our senior executives are important to our success because they have been instrumental in setting the strategical direction of our company  operating our business  identifying areas for expansion and arranging necessary financing 
these key personnel include jamie b 
coulter  our chairman and chief executive officer  and certain of our other executive officers 
although we feel that there is a significant pool of talented personnel in the restaurant industry  if these members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  it could adversely affect our business and development 
shareholders may not be able to resell their stock or may have to sell at a price substantially lower than the price they paid for it 
the trading price for our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results  general conditions in the restaurant industry or the general economy  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations affecting the market price for public companies generally  or within broad industry groups  which fluctuations may be unrelated to the operating results or other circumstances of a particular company 
such fluctuations may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock  as well as price that holders may achieve for their shares upon any future sale 
staggered board  blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for three classes of directors  to be elected on a staggered basis 
this enables existing management to exercise significant control over the our affairs  and may act as an impediment to any future attempts to by third parties to take control of our board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority without further action by the stockholders to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions thereof 
the exercise of this authority may act as a further impediment to any future attempts to by third parties to take control of our board of directors
