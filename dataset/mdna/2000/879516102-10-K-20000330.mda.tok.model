item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of changes in the market values of its investments 
the company invests in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 
for these non quoted investments  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
such investments  which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments 
a downturn in the equity markets could cause a reduction in revenue since the number of subscribers tends to increase in an upward market 
this downturn could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations  however  the company believes that the effect of such adverse conditions would be minimized by its alliances with third parties  which in some cases provide for guaranteed minimum payments
