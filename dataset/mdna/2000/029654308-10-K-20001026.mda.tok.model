the oak hill transaction 
on august   we completed the sale of  shares of our series b convertible exchangeable preferred stock to oak hill capital partners  lp and certain related entities  realizing gross proceeds of million 
we used million of the proceeds to reduce indebtedness under our senior credit facility this credit facility is described in footnote to the accompanying financial statements  approximately million of which has been reborrowed and invested in our principal real estate development subsidiary  american skiing company resort properties  inc the remainder of the proceeds were used to pay approximately million in fees and expenses in connection with the series b preferred stock sale approximately million and related transactions approximately million  and acquire from our principal shareholder certain strategic assets and repay a demand note issued by one of our subsidiaries to our principal shareholder  in the aggregate amount of million 
liquidity and capital resources short term 
our primary short term liquidity needs involve funding seasonal working capital requirements  continuing and completing real estate development projects presently under construction  funding our fiscal capital improvement program and servicing our debt 
our cash requirements for ski related and real estate development activities are provided from separate sources 
our primary source of liquidity for ski related working capital and ski related capital improvements are cash flow from operations of our non real estate subsidiaries and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
real estate development and real estate working capital is funded primarily through construction financing facilities established for major real estate development projects  a real estate term facility  and net proceeds from the sale of real estate developed for sale after required construction loan repayments 
these facilities are without recourse to us and our resort operating subsidiaries and are collateralized by significant real estate assets of american skiing company resort properties and its subsidiaries  including the assets and stock of grand summit resort properties  inc  our primary hotel development subsidiary 
as of july   the book value of the total assets that collateralized these facilities and which are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet was approximately million 
resort liquidity 
we have established a million senior credit facility agreement with fleet national bank  as agent  and certain other lenders  consisting of a million revolving portion and a million term portion 
the revolving portion of the senior credit facility matures on may   and the term portion matures on may  the maximum availability under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility reduces over its term by certain prescribed amounts 
as of october   total borrowings under the revolving credit were million  and million of availability was allocated to cover outstanding letters of credit 
the term portion of the senior credit facility amortizes in five annual installments of  payable on may of each year  with the remaining portion of the principal due in two substantially equal installments on may  and may  as of october   the outstanding balance of the term portion has been reduced by  to million 
in addition  the senior credit facility requires mandatory prepayment of the term portion and a reduction in the availability under the revolving portion of an amount equal to of the consolidated excess cash flows during any period in which excess cash flow leverage ratio exceeds to in no event  however  will such mandatory prepayments reduce the revolving portion of the facility below million 
we do not presently expect to generate consolidated excess cash flows during fiscal and there were none generated in fiscal the senior credit facility contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for this type of credit facility  which includes maintaining certain financial ratios 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and subsidiaries except those of our real estate development subsidiaries 
the revolving portion of the facility is subject to an annual day clean down requirement  which period must include april of each year  during which the sum of the outstanding principal balance and letter of credit exposure shall not exceed million for fiscal and million for each fiscal year thereafter 
we successfully completed the day clean down requirement for fiscal on april  the senior credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are prohibited from paying dividends in excess of of the consolidated net income of the non real estate development subsidiaries after april   and further prohibited from paying dividends under any circumstances when the effect of such payment would cause the debt to ebitda ratio of the non real estate development subsidiaries to exceed to based upon these and other restrictions  we do not expect to be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock  mandatorily redeemable preferred stock or series b preferred stock during fiscal or fiscal due to the adverse weather conditions in the eastern united states  utah and the sierra nevadas during our second fiscal quarter of  and their effect on our second quarter revenue  ebitda and net income  we amended the senior credit facility on march  in order to i suspend our second quarter financial covenant requirements  ii significantly modify the financial covenant requirements of the senior credit facility for our second and third fiscal quarters and on a prospective basis  iii establish minimum quarterly ebitda levels starting with our third quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal  and iv establish monthly restrictions on the maximum amount outstanding under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility for the period from may through december  we exceeded our required minimum ebitda levels under the amended senior credit facility for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of and we successfully fulfilled the maximum usage requirement for each monthly period through october  based on historical operations  we presently anticipate that we will be able to meet the financial covenants of the amended senior credit facility 
failure to meet one or more of these covenants could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 
in the event that such default were not waived by the lenders holding a majority of the debt under the senior credit facility  this default would also constitute defaults under one or more of our other major credit facilities  the consequences of which would likely be material and adverse to our business 
the amended senior credit facility also places a maximum level of non real estate capital expenditures of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  exclusive of certain capital expenditures in connection with the sale of series b preferred stock during the first quarter of fiscal following fiscal  annual resort capital expenditures  exclusive of real estate capital expenditures  are limited to the lesser of million  or the total of the non real estate development subsidiaries consolidated ebitda for the four fiscal quarters ended in april of the previous fiscal year less the consolidated debt service for the same period 
in addition to the foregoing amounts  we are permitted to and expect to make capital expenditures of up to million for the purchase and construction of a new gondola at our heavenly resort in lake tahoe  nevada  on which construction is currently underway and million has been expended as of october  our liquidity is significantly affected by our high leverage 
as a result of our leveraged position  we will have significant cash requirements to service interest and principal payments on our debt 
consequently  cash availability for working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions is limited  outside of any availability under the senior credit facility 
furthermore  the senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes  due  each contain significant restrictions on our ability to obtain additional sources of capital and may affect our liquidity 
these restrictions include restrictions on the sale of assets  restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and restrictions on the issuance of preferred stock 
as of october   we have drawn or committed for letters of credit approximately million of the total million revolving portion of our senior credit facility 
we expect to maximize borrowings under the senior credit facility sometime between november and december of  consistent with our historical experience when we have had little  if any  borrowing availability under the senior credit facility 
under the indenture for our senior subordinated notes  due  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends or making other distributions to our shareholders 
real estate liquidity 
funding of working capital for american skiing company resort properties and its fiscal real estate development program is provided by a real estate term facility and the net proceeds from the sale of real estate developed for sale after required construction loan repayments 
on july   we entered into a second amended real estate facility agreement between american skiing company resort properties and fleet national bank 
this fully syndicated million facility replaced the previous un syndicated million real estate development term loan facility 
as of october  the amount drawn under the facility was million  leaving availability of million  of which million is set aside as a liquidity reserve 
the second amended real estate facility is collateralized by security interests in  and mortgages on  substantially all of american skiing company resort properties assets  which primarily consist of undeveloped real property and the stock of its real estate development subsidiaries including grand summit resort properties 
as of july   the book value of the total assets that collateralized the real estate facilities  and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  was approximately million 
the second amended real estate facility is comprised of three tranches  each with separate interest rates and maturity dates 
tranche a has a maximum principal amount of million  bears interest at a variable rate equal to the fleet national bank base rate plus  or a current rate of  payable monthly in arrears and matures on december  mandatory principal payments on tranche a of million each are payable on april   july  and october  tranche b has a maximum principal amount of million  bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures on december  interest calculated at per annum for tranche b is payable monthly in arrears 
the remaining per annum will accrue  be added to the principal balance of tranche b and will bear interest at per annum  compounded annually 
tranche c has a maximum principal amount of million  bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and matures on december  interest will accrue  be added to the principal balance of tranche c and will bear interest at per annum  compounded semi annually 
as of october   the principal balances outstanding  including accrued and unpaid interest  under tranches a  b c of the second amended real estate facility were million  million  and million  respectively 
tranche c of the second amended real estate facility was purchased by oak hill capital partners  lp in connection with this million investment  we entered a securities purchase agreement with oak hill  dated as of july   pursuant to which we agreed to either issue warrants to oak hill for  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  or issue to oak hill common stock in american skiing company resort properties  representing approximately of the voting interest in that entity 
the purchase price of the warrants or american skiing company resort properties common stock  as applicable was million 
we expect to issue the warrants following receipt of necessary lender consents 
we conduct substantially all of our real estate development through single purpose subsidiaries  each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of american skiing company resort properties 
grand summit hotel projects are constructed through grand summit resort properties and are primarily financed through a million construction loan facility among grand summit resort properties and various lenders  including tfc textron financial  the syndication agent and administrative agent  which closed on september  as of october   the amount outstanding under the construction loan facility was million 
this facility matures on march  and bears interest at the rate of prime plus per annum  or a current rate of 
the principal is payable incrementally as quartershare sales are closed based on a predetermined per unit amount  which approximates between and of the net proceeds of each closing 
the facility is collateralized by mortgages against the project sites including the completed grand summit hotels at killington  mt 
snow  sunday river  attitash bear peak and the canyons  as well as the recently completed steamboat grand hotel  and is subject to covenants  representations and warranties customary for this type of construction facility 
the facility is non recourse to us and our resort operating subsidiaries although it is collateralized by substantial assets of grand summit resort properties  having a total book value of million as of july   which in turn comprise substantial assets of our business 
due to construction delays and cost increases at the steamboat grand summit hotel project  grand summit resort properties entered into a million subordinated loan tranche with tfc textron financial on july  this facility is to be used solely for the purpose of providing advances to fund the completion of the steamboat grand hotel 
the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable monthly in arrears  provided that only of the amount of such interest shall be due and payable in cash and the other of such interest shall  if no events of default exist under the subordinated loan tranche facility or the construction loan textron facility  automatically be deferred until the final payment date 
as of october   the amount outstanding under the subordinated loan tranche facility was million 
on july  westgate resorts  a division of privately held central florida investment firm  purchased land and timeshare development rights at the canyons near park city  ut 
the land is expected to be used for the construction of the westgate at the canyons timeshare project in the resort s village core 
westgate purchased the land and development rights for million 
in addition  westgate separately contracted with us to purchase  lift tickets at the canyons over the next five years to support its sales efforts 
the ticket contract is expected to yield revenue of approximately million 
the planned facilities at the project are expected include nearly  square feet of retail space  a health spa  a restaurant  a heated pool  outdoor hot tubs and a private club for westgate owners 
the project is expected to be sold in one and two week intervals 
on october   we sold our option rights to certain real estate in the south lake tahoe redevelopment district to marriott ownership resorts  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of marriott international  for million 
pursuant to the terms of the option sale  american skiing company resort properties received million in cash proceeds on october  applied a million previously received deposit and will receive an additional million from marriott on january  simultaneously with the closing of the sale of its option rights  our july  development agreement with marriott was terminated 
management believes that the termination of this agreement will allow american skiing company resort properties to more aggressively market certain developmental real estate at its killington and steamboat resorts to other potential timeshare investors 
in addition  we continue to discuss with marriott a possible development at killington  but have not and may not reach an acceptable agreement regarding this parcel 
our fiscal business plan anticipates starting two real estate projects in the spring and summer of  a grand summit hotel at heavenly and townhomes at the canyons 
commencement of these projects is subject to satisfying the requisite pre sale hurdles  our cash flow requirements and arranging appropriate financing for these projects 
long term 
our primary long term liquidity needs are to fund skiing related capital improvements at certain of our resorts  development of our slope side real estate and the mandatory redemption of our series a preferred stock on november  with respect to capital needs  we have invested over million in skiing related facilities since the beginning of fiscal as a result  and in keeping with restrictions imposed under the senior credit facility  we expect our resort capital programs for the next several fiscal years will be more limited in size 
our fiscal resort capital program is estimated at approximately million of which had been expended as of october   plus an additional estimated million to be expended on the heavenly gondola project of which had been expended as of october  
for our and fiscal years  we anticipate our annual maintenance capital needs to be approximately million 
there is a considerable degree of flexibility in the timing and  to a lesser degree  scope of our growth capital program 
although specific capital expenditures can be deferred for extended periods  continued growth of skier visits  revenues and profitability will require continued capital investment in on mountain improvements 
our practice is to finance on mountain capital improvements through resort cash flow  capital leases and our senior credit facility 
the size and scope of the capital improvement program will generally be determined annually depending upon the strategic importance and expected financial return of certain projects  future availability of cash flow from each season s resort operations and future borrowing availability and covenant restrictions under the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility places a maximum level of non real estate capital expenditures for fiscal and beyond at the lesser of million  or the total of the non real estate development subsidiaries consolidated ebitda for the four fiscal quarters ended in april of the previous fiscal year less consolidated debt service for the same period 
in addition  we are permitted to and expect to make capital expenditures of up to million for the purchase and construction of a new gondola at our heavenly resort in lake tahoe  nevada 
construction on the heavenly gondola began in june  and as of october   we had expended million on this project 
our management believes that these capital expenditure amounts will be sufficient to meet our non real estate capital improvement needs for the near future 
our business plan anticipates the development of grand summit hotels  condominium hotels and townhouses at our resort villages at the canyons  heavenly  killington  steamboat and sunday river 
the timing and extent of these projects are subject to local and state permitting requirements which may be beyond our control  as well as our cash flow requirements and the availability of external capital 
our real estate development is undertaken through our real estate development subsidiary  american skiing company resort properties 
recourse on debt incurred to finance this real estate development is limited to american skiing company resort properties and its subsidiaries  which include grand summit resort properties 
this debt is usually collateralized by the projects that it finances  which  in some cases  constitute a significant portion of our assets 
as of july   the total assets collateralizing the real estate facilities  and included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  totaled approximately million 
american skiing company resort properties eight existing development projects are currently being funded by the second amended real estate facility  the construction loan facility and a separate construction loan facility for the final phase of the locke mountain townhomes at sunday river 
the locke mountain project is currently sold and proceeds from closings are expected to be received and used to repay the debt during the nd quarter of fiscal we expect to undertake future real estate development projects through special purpose subsidiaries with financing provided principally on a non recourse basis to us and our resort operating subsidiaries 
although this financing is expected to be non recourse to us and our resort subsidiaries  it will likely be collateralized by our existing and future real estate projects that may constitute significant assets to us 
required equity contributions for these projects must be generated before they can be undertaken  and the projects are subject to mandatory pre sale requirements under the second amended real estate facility 
potential sources of equity contributions include sales proceeds from existing real estate projects and assets  to the extent not applied to the repayment of indebtedness and the possible sale of equity or debt interests in american skiing company resort properties or its real estate development subsidiaries 
financing commitments for future real estate development do not currently exist  and we can offer no assurance that they will be available on satisfactory terms 
we will be required to establish both equity sources and construction facilities or other financing arrangements for our projects before undertaking them 
we have outstanding million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  with an accreted value of million as of october  
the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock is exchangeable at the option of the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of for each common share 
we expect to hold the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock until its maturity date of november   at which time we will be required to redeem the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of approximately million 
we can give no assurance that the necessary liquidity will be available to effect the redemption on a timely basis 
results of operations of the company fiscal year ended july  fiscal versus fiscal year ended july  fiscal resort operations the components of resort operations for the fiscal years ended july  and july  are as follows actual year actual ended year ended increase decrease july  july  dollar percent revenue category lift tickets food and beverage retail sales lodging and property skier development golf  summer activities and other total resort revenues total skier visits   cost of resort operations marketing  general and administrative depreciation and amortization warm weather patterns in early november  a rainy thanksgiving weekend in the east and a warm  dry december nationwide all contributed to weak early season paid skier day levels 
the december holiday week was also negatively impacted by the overall softness in the travel industry due to yk concerns and the lack of natural snowfall in key market areas 
substantial natural snowfall at all resorts and in key market areas late in our second fiscal quarter revived sluggish early season skier traffic heading into the third quarter 
this momentum continued into february  during which fresh snowfall and good weather for the presidents holiday weekend produced three day attendance records at almost all of our resorts 
skier traffic and operating results continued to be strong into march  but warm weather nation wide and sustained rainfall in the east brought an early end to the ski season and as a result april resort revenues and operating profits fell short of the prior year 
revenues from lift tickets and retail sales were down a combined million  or  from the prior year due mainly to the decrease in paid skier days for the year 
food and beverage and lodging services revenues increased in fiscal  as revenues generated from the two new hotels at the canyons offset the effect of the decrease in skier days at our eastern resorts 
skier development revenues actually increased by million  or  in fiscal  as we continued to realize the benefits of its new skier development programs instituted in fiscal in conjunction with the opening of new sprint perfect turn discovery centers at four of our eastern resorts 
we also realized million in net gains from the sale of non strategic assets during the first quarter of fiscal  which contributed most of the million increase in golf  summer activities and other revenues in fiscal our resort segment generated a million loss before income taxes in fiscal  compared to a million pre tax loss in fiscal this million decrease in the year to date pre tax loss is derived primarily from an million decrease in interest expense  offset by a million decrease in resort earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  or ebitda  and a million increase in depreciation expense 
the reduction in interest expense in fiscal is due primarily to the reduced level of debt outstanding under our senior credit facility as a result of the paydown on that facility from the proceeds of the series b preferred stock issuance 
the decrease in resort earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation is derived from the net effect of i the million decrease in resort revenues described above  ii a million increase in resort operating expenses due mainly to pre opening and start up costs associated with the two new hotels at the canyons and the steamboat grand hotel  increased snowmaking and maintenance costs  food and beverage and lodging costs and retail costs of goods sold  and iii a million reduction in marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in resort depreciation expense is due to the approximately million in ski related capital assets placed in service at our resorts since the end of the ski season 
real estate operations real estate revenues increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  from million to million 
the delivery of units in the sundial whole ownership condominium hotel and the new grand summit hotel at the canyons accounted for million and million  respectively  of real estate revenues in fiscal additional increases in real estate revenues during fiscal resulted from sales of undeveloped land at steamboat and the canyons combined million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and a million increase in quartershare unit sales at the existing grand summit hotels at our eastern resorts million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
an offsetting million decrease was due to revenues recognized in fiscal from the sale of townhouses at sunday river  which did not recur in fiscal our real estate segment generated a loss before income taxes of million in fiscal  a million improvement over the million pre tax real estate loss generated in fiscal this million decrease in the pre tax loss in fiscal is primarily derived from the net effect of a million increase in real estate ebitda offset by a million increase in real estate interest expense and a million increase in real estate depreciation 
the sale of units at the canyons grand summit hotel contributed in real estate ebitda in fiscal  there were no sales for this project in fiscal offsetting this increase in real estate ebitda was a decrease of million from the sales of quarter shares at the eastern grand summit hotels 
the sundial project contributed a negative 
million ebitda to the fiscal results  the first year this project recorded sales 
all other activities contributed a net positive 
million to real estate ebitda compared to the prior year s results 
the million increase in real estate interest expense was primarily due to an increase in real estate debt outstanding in fiscal and lower capitalized interest due to completion of the two hotels at the canyons 
benefit from income taxes decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in the benefit is due primarily to million in valuation allowances established in fiscal relating to certain deferred tax assets for prior net operating losses 
as a result of the sale of our series b preferred stock  the realization of the tax benefit of certain of our net operating losses and other tax attributes is dependent upon the occurrence of certain future events 
it is our judgment that a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets for net operating losses and other tax attributes is appropriate because it is more likely than not that the benefit of such losses and attributes will not be realized 
based on facts known at this time  we expect to substantially realize the benefit of the remainder of our net operating losses and other tax attributes affected by the sale of our series b preferred stock 
the remaining million valuation allowance relates to excess net operating losses that may not be realizable in the state of vermont 
extraordinary loss of million net of million of tax benefits in fiscal resulted from the pro rata write off of certain existing deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility 
this write off was due to the restructuring of the senior credit facility in connection with the permanent reduction in the availability of the revolving portion and the pay down of the term portion of the facility from the proceeds of the series b preferred stock issuance 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million net of million tax benefit in fiscal resulted from the write off of certain capitalized start up costs relating to our hotel and retail operations and the opening of the canyons resort in fiscal the accounting change was due to our adoption of aicpa statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires the expensing of all start up costs as incurred  rather than capitalizing and subsequently amortizing such costs 
initial adoption of this sop should be reported as a cumulative effective of a change in accounting principles 
current start up costs are being expensed as incurred and are reflected in their appropriate expense classifications accretion of discount and dividends accrued on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock increased million from million in fiscal to million in the current fiscal year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the additional accrual of dividends on  shares of series b preferred stock issued to oak hill in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently accruing dividends on the series b preferred stock at an effective rate of  with the assumption that dividends will not be paid in cash until the fifth anniversary of the issuance 
fiscal versus fiscal year ended july  fiscal the actual results of fiscal versus the actual results of fiscal discussed below are not comparable due to the acquisition of the steamboat and heavenly resorts on november  accordingly  the usefulness of the comparisons presented below is limited  as the fiscal results include the results of steamboat and heavenly since november   while the fiscal results include all twelve months of results of steamboat and heavenly 
the following table illustrates the pro forma effect of the results of steamboat and heavenly as if the purchase had occurred at the beginning of fiscal pro forma actual year effect on pro forma actual pro forma increase ended year ended year ended year ended decrease july  july  july  july  dollar percent revenue category lift tickets food and beverage retail sales lodging and property skier development golf  summer activities and other total resort revenues cost of resort operations marketing  general and administrative depreciation and amortization resort revenues increased million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the pro forma effect of the inclusion of the results from steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the remaining million increase in resort revenues is broken out by revenue category in the above table 
the decrease in lift ticket revenues is derived from i a decrease in skier visits  due to unfavorable weather conditions in new england and colorado  resulted in an approximately million decrease in lift ticket revenues  and ii a increase in lift ticket yield  due mainly to price increases at steamboat and heavenly  offset this decrease by approximately million 
increases in food and beverage and retail sales revenues are primarily attributable to additional food and beverage and retail outlets 
the increase in skier development revenues is mainly associated with a new skier development program instituted in fiscal  which corresponded with the opening of new sprint discovery centers at four of our eastern resorts 
the increase in lodging revenue is primarily due to the full year of operations in fiscal of three grand summit hotels which opened during fiscal one each at killington  mount snow and sunday river 
real estate revenues decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the substantial revenues recognized in fiscal from closings on pre sold quartershare units at our grand summit hotels at killington and mt 
snow  and the jordan grand hotel at sunday river 
these projects were completed during the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal  and we realized million in sales revenue from these projects in fiscal for fiscal we realized million in on going sales of quartershare units 
cost of resort operations increased million or from million to million 
the pro forma effect of the inclusion of the results of steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the majority of the remaining increase is attributable to i million in lodging costs associated with a full year of operation of three new hotels  ii million increase associated with a new skier development program which included the operation of four new sprint discovery centers  iii million in food and beverage and retail costs associated with additional outlets and higher sales volume and the liquidation of excess inventory during the fourth quarter of fiscal  iv million increase in snowmaking due to the lack of natural snow at our eastern resorts  v million increase in property taxes due to increased tax rates in vermont and an increased asset base at the canyons  and vi million increase in event costs associated with marketing sponsorship 
cost of real estate sold decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is attributable to the substantial cost recognized in the third quarter of fiscal from closings of pre sold quartershare units at our grand summit hotels at killington and mt 
snow and the jordan grand hotel at sunday river 
the cost associated with the revenue realized for fiscal year totaled million 
the cost associated with the on going sales of these units in fiscal totaled million 
the million decrease related to sales of quartershare units was offset by other increases  due mainly to i million of cost recognized relating to the sale of land which was not of strategic importance to our real estate development plan or resort operations  ii the write off of million in prepaid advertising and commission charges incurred in generating pre sale contracts  some of which have subsequently expired  for a grand summit hotel at our sugarbush resort the timing of development for the sugarbush project is expected to be re evaluated by the company during next year s skiing season and iii million of expenses were incurred during the second quarter of fiscal relating to our unsuccessful million bond offering which was undertaken to provide additional financing for our real estate projects 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased million or from million to million 
the inclusion of the results of steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the majority of the remaining increase is attributable to i a planned increase in marketing expense at all the resorts of million ii a stock compensation charge of million relating to the vesting of additional management stock options  iii million of additional expenses resulting from the expansion of management information services  iv million of severance payments and restructuring of management compensation and v additional costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the inclusion of the steamboat and heavenly resorts for the first fiscal quarter of accounts for million of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily due to additional depreciation on capital improvements of approximately million made this year 
these increases are slightly offset by the change in the estimated useful lives of certain of our ski related assets  which decreased depreciation expense by million 
interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase is principally attributable to increased debt levels associated with financing our recent capital improvements and real estate projects 
the benefit for income taxes increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to the increase in the loss before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the non recurring stock option compensation charge of million in fiscal  not all of which was deductible for income tax purposes 
accretion of discount and dividends accrued on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to million in additional accretion recognized during fiscal relating to a conversion feature on our series a exchangeable preferred stock that allowed holders of these securities to convert to shares of our common stock at a discount to our initial public offering price 
an additional million of the decrease is due to amortization of issuance costs recognized in fiscal related to our series a exchangeable preferred stock upon its conversion into mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
these decreases were offset by an increase resulting from the full twelve months accretion for fiscal related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as compared to only nine months in fiscal  and the compounding effect of the dividend accrual 
recently issued accounting standards effective july   we will adopt sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
collectively sfas as amended or the statement 
we are required to adopt sfas as amended no later than the beginning of our fiscal reporting period beginning july  these standards will be adopted as a change in accounting principle and cannot be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
sfas as amended requires that we record derivatives on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at fair value 
the statement also requires that we must record derivatives that are not hedges at fair value through earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows us to offset a derivative instrument s gains and losses against related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective  and requires that we must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas as amended  in part  allows special hedge accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
the statement provides that the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedging instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  be recognized currently in earnings in the same accounting period 
sfas as amended provides that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized currently through earnings regardless of whether the instrument is designated as a hedge 
we have five interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of july   two of which we have designated as cash flow hedges 
cash flow hedges we have entered into two interest rate swap agreements  with a total notional amount of million 
under these arrangements  which may be terminated on november  by the floating rate payer  we receive the day libor rate and pay a fixed rate of 
prior to adoption of fas as amended  we have treated these swaps as hedges and accounted for them as such 
we have not recorded any amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of july  in connection with these instruments and the net effect of the hedges was to record interest expense at the fixed rate of on the first million of debt 
we have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges of variable future cash flows associated with the interest on our senior credit facility through november  upon adoption  we will record the fair value of these swaps as an asset on the balance sheet with a corresponding credit to other comprehensive income 
we will record subsequent changes in fair value of the swaps through other comprehensive income  except for changes related to ineffectiveness  during the period these instruments are designated as hedges 
we do not currently anticipate ineffectiveness under these hedges through november  the net effect of the cash flow hedges will be for us to record interest expense at the fixed rate of plus based on our current leverage on the first million of debt 
if the swap agreements are not terminated on november  all subsequent changes in the fair value will be accounted for through earnings 
other derivatives we entered into three interest rate swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas as amended 
the net effect of these swaps will result in a million interest savings for us over the life of the senior subordinated notes  due as of july   we have recorded  in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and we have been recording the net effect of the interest savings through the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the agreements

as of july   we had million in floating rate long term debt outstanding  including current portion 
we have entered into a million notional value interest rate swap agreement in connection with our senior credit facility  which effectively swaps a portion of the variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
under this agreement  which may be terminated by the floating rate payer on november   we pay a fixed rate of and receive the day libor rate 
as of july   total borrowings under the senior credit facility were million  leaving million at a variable rate for which the current interest rate is libor plus

we have also entered into a series of non cancelable interest rate swap agreements in connection with our senior subordinated notes  which are intended to defer a portion of the cash interest payments on the notes into later years
