overview artisan is a leading developer of high performance  high density and low power embedded memory  standard cell and i o components for the design and manufacture of complex ics 
the company licenses its products to semiconductor manufacturers and fabless semiconductor companies for the design of ics used in complex  high volume applications  such as portable computing devices  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers and workstations 
beginning in late fiscal  the company implemented a royalty based business model that is intended to generate revenue from both license fees and royalties 
the company generally licenses its products on a nonexclusive  worldwide basis to major semiconductor manufacturers and grants these manufacturers the right to distribute the company s ip components to their internal design teams and to distribute and sublicense to semiconductor design companies that manufacture at the same facility 
in cases where the semiconductor manufacturer does not have the infrastructure necessary to distribute and support the company s ip components  the company performs the distribution function directly to the customers of the semiconductor manufacturer 
license fees and royalties are received under the terms of license agreements with customers to provide the company s ip component products 
typically  a customer licenses one or more products that are accompanied by layout databases  views to support a customer s ic design tool environment and design methodology documentation 
the license of the company s products typically involves a sales cycle of six to months and often coincides with a customer s migration to a new manufacturing process 
the company s contracts generally require a customer to pay a license fee to artisan ranging from approximately  to  for each product delivered under a contract 
the company s contracts generally require a customer to pay a portion of the license fees upon signing of the contract with the final payment due within to days after the completion of customization  which generally takes three to six months 
royalty payments are calculated based on per unit sales of ics or wafers containing the company s ip components 
given that the company provides its products early in the customer s ic design process  there is a significant delay between the delivery of a product and the generation of royalty revenue 
to date  the substantial majority of the company s license revenue has been recognized on a percentage of completion method 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
as the completion period for a project ranges from three to six months  revenue in any quarter is dependent on the company s progress toward completion of the project 
there can be no assurance that the company s estimates will be accurate  and  in the event they are not  the company s business  operating results and financial condition in subsequent periods could be materially adversely affected 
the company has received royalty reports from four of its customers 
net royalty revenue was and of total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
according to contract terms  a portion of each royalty payment is credited back to the customer s account for use as payment of license fees for future orders placed with the company 
the remaining portion of the royalty is reported as net royalty revenue 
the amount of credit back that can be earned by a customer is limited to the cumulative amount of orders placed by that customer for a given process technology 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to generate royalty revenue from a substantially larger number of designs and on many of these designs achieving large manufacturing volumes

historically  a substantial portion of the company s revenue has been international revenue 
in fiscal  and  international revenue  primarily in asia and europe  represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
the company anticipates that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of its revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars

while net royalty revenue accounted for of total revenue in fiscal  the company derives a substantial majority of all of its revenue from license fees associated with sales of its products  including support and maintenance  that together accounted for  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
although the percent of revenue represented by license revenue has declined  the company expects that license revenue will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenue for the foreseeable future 
see results of operations and factors affecting future operating results product concentration 
since the company s inception in april  each of the company s cost and expense categories has generally increased as the company has added personnel and increased its activities in these areas 
the company intends to continue making significant expenditures  particularly those associated with engineering and sales and marketing  and expects that these costs and expenses will continue to be a large percentage of revenue in future periods 
the company in the past has experienced delays in the progress of certain projects  and there can be no assurance that such delays will not occur in the future 
any delay or failure to achieve progress could result in damage to customer relationships and the company s reputation  under utilization of engineering resources or a delay in the market acceptance of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  some of the company s older contracts with customers generally may be canceled without cause  and if a customer cancels or delays performance under any such contracts  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s costs and expenses will be based in part on the company s expectations of future revenue 
accordingly  if the company does not realize its expected revenue  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has  in the past  experienced periods of negative growth as well as declines in the rate of growth of its revenue as compared with prior periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will experience positive revenue growth in the future

in connection with the grant of options for the purchase of  shares of common stock to employees during the period from december through march and  shares of common stock to non employees in january  the company recorded aggregate deferred compensation of approximately  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
such deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period relating to the options  of which approximately   and  were amortized during fiscal  and  respectively

as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities of million 
as of september   the company had retained earnings of million and working capital of million that includes the current portion of deferred revenue of million 
the company anticipates spending approximately million in capital expenditures over the next months 
the company intends to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to its existing products 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which the company s existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the level and timing of license and royalty revenue  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
the company believes that its current cash and investment balances and any cash generated from operations and from available or future debt financing will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  from time to time  the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies or products 
the failure of the company to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments or hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no

b to defer for an additional two quarters  the effective date of implementing sab no 
 with earlier application encouraged 
the adoption of sab no 
is required in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of sab no 
to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations

this interpretation has provisions that are effective on staggered dates  some of which began after december  and january   and others that became effective after june  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in high quality corporate issuers and in debt instruments of the us government and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in its policy  the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates

the company s future operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and on an annual basis as a result of these and other factors  in particular the relatively large size and small number of customer orders during a given period and the amount of royalties recognized in a given period 
accordingly  it is likely that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of the company s common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
the limited number of semiconductor manufacturers to which the company can license its products may also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition if any of the company s customers suffers a deterioration in financial condition or there is a decline in the demand for the semiconductors produced by such manufacturers 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition may also be materially adversely affected if customers experience project delays and or new or existing customers delay new bookings or fail to place anticipated orders 
revenue in any quarter is dependent on a number of factors and is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
since the company s expense levels are based in part on management s expectations regarding future revenue  if revenue is below expectations in any quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
accordingly  if the company does not realize its expected revenue  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s sales cycle can be lengthy and is subject to a number of risks over which the company has little or no control 
as a result of the significant dollar amounts represented by a single customer order  the timing of the receipt of an order can have a significant impact on the company s revenue for a particular period 
in addition  because the company s revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers  a decline or a delay in the recognition of revenue from one customer in a period may cause the company s business  operating results and financial condition in such period to be materially adversely affected and may lead to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
any significant or ongoing failure to obtain new orders from customers or to collect outstanding accounts receivable would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has  in the past  experienced periods of negative growth as well as declines in the rate of growth of its revenue as compared with prior periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will experience stable or increasing revenues in the future 
to date  a substantial majority of the company s revenue has been recognized on a percentage of completion method 
provisions for estimated losses on the uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
as the completion period ranges from three to six months  revenue in any quarter is dependent on the company s progress toward completion of the project 
there can be no assurance that the company s estimates will be accurate  and  in the event they are not  the company s business  operating results and financial condition in subsequent periods could be materially adversely affected 
from time to time  the company experiences delays in the progress of certain projects  and there can be no assurance that such delays will not occur in the future 
any delay or failure to achieve progress could result in damage to customer relationships and the company s reputation  under utilization of engineering resources or a delay in the market acceptance of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  some of the company s older contracts with customers generally may be canceled without cause  and  if a customer cancels or delays performance under any such contracts  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

dependence on license fee and royalty based business model the company has historically generated revenue from license fees only 
beginning in late fiscal  the company implemented a business model that is intended to generate revenue from both license fees and royalties 
the company generally licenses its products on a nonexclusive  worldwide basis to major semiconductor manufacturers and grants these manufacturers the right to distribute the company s ip components to their internal design teams and to distribute and sublicense to semiconductor design companies that manufacture at the same facility 
in cases where the semiconductor manufacturer does not have the infrastructure necessary to distribute and support the company s ip components  the company performs the distribution function directly to the customers of the semiconductor manufacturer 
given that the company provides its products early in the customer s ic design process  there is a significant delay between the delivery of a product and the generation of royalty revenue 
royalty payments are calculated based on per unit sales of ics or wafers containing the company s ip 
a portion of these payments is credited back to the customer s account for use as payment of license fees for future orders to be placed with the company 
the remaining portion of the royalty is reported as net royalty revenue 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company received its first royalty revenue 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to generate royalty revenue from a substantially larger number of designs and on many of these designs achieving large manufacturing volumes 
the company s ability to generate such royalty revenue will in turn depend in part on its ability to negotiate  structure  monitor and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in expanding the number of royalty bearing contracts with customers  and there can be no assurance that the company will receive significant royalty revenue in the future 
see dependence on semiconductor manufacturers  dependence on semiconductor and electronics industries and customer concentration  limited customer base 
the company believes that its long term success will be substantially dependent on future royalties 
in addition  the company faces risks inherent in a royalty based business model 
in particular  the company s ability to forecast royalty revenue is limited by factors that are beyond the company s ability to control or assess in advance 
royalties are recognized in the quarter in which the company receives a royalty report from its customers and are dependent upon fluctuating sales volumes 
in addition  under the royalty based business model  the company s revenue is dependent upon the sales by its customers of products that incorporate the company s technology 
even if the company s technology is adopted  there can be no assurance that it will be used in a product that is ultimately brought to market  achieves commercial acceptance or results in significant royalties to the company 
the company also faces risks relating to the accuracy and completeness of the royalty collection process 
the company has only limited experience and systems in place to conduct reviews of the accuracy of the royalty reports it receives from its licensees 
the company has the right to audit its licensee s records to ensure the integrity of their royalty reporting systems  however  such audits may only be conducted periodically and are at the company s expense in the event that no material errors in reported royalties are found 
the company does not have internal systems or staff dedicated to monitoring the royalty obligations of its customers  and if it were to implement such systems and hire such staff in the short term  the costs of those systems and staff could largely offset the revenue the company receives in the form of royalties 
see results of operations 
dependence on emergence of merchant ip component market and broad market acceptance of the company s products the market for merchant ip components has only recently emerged 
the company s ability to achieve sustained revenue growth and profitability in the future will depend on the continued development of this market and  to a large extent  on the demand for system on a chip ics 
system on a chip ics are characterized by rapid technological change and competition from an increasing number of alternate design strategies such as multi chip system on package and chip size packaging designs 
there can be no assurance that the merchant ip component and system on a chip markets will continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support the company s business 
if either of these markets fails to grow or develops slower than expected  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
to date  the company s ip products have been licensed only by a limited number of customers 
the vast majority of the company s existing and potential customers currently rely on components developed internally and or by other vendors 
the company s future growth  if any  is dependent on the adoption of  and increased reliance on  merchant ip components by both existing and potential customers 
moreover  if the company s products do not achieve broad market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
competition within the merchant segment of the ip component market  the company primarily competes against avant  nurlogic  the silicon architects division of synopsys  virage and virtual silicon 
the company may face competition from consulting firms and companies that typically have operated in the generic library segment of the ip market and that now seek to offer customized ip components as enhancements to their generic solutions 
the company also faces significant competition from the internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers that are expanding their manufacturing capabilities and portfolio of ip components to participate in the system on a chip market 
these internal design groups compete with the company for access to the parent s ip component requisitions and may eventually compete with the company to supply ip components to third parties on a merchant basis 
there can be no assurance that internal design groups will not expand their product offerings to compete directly with those of the company or will not actively seek to participate as merchant vendors in the ip component market by selling to third party semiconductor manufacturers or  if they do  that the company will be able to compete against them successfully 
in addition to competition from companies in the merchant ip component market  the company faces competition from vendors that supply electronic design automation eda software tools  including certain of those mentioned above  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against them 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from new market entrants with products that may be less expensive than the company s ip components or that may provide better performance or additional features not currently provided by the company 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  lower cost structures and larger customer bases than the company 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  certain of the company s principal competitors offer a single vendor solution  since  in the case of eda tool companies  they maintain their own eda design tools and ip libraries or  in the case of internal design groups  they provide ip components developed to utilize the qualities of a given manufacturing process  and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
the company s ability to compete successfully in the emerging market for ip components will depend upon certain factors  many of which are beyond the company s control including  but not limited to  success in designing new products  implementing new designs at smaller process geometries  access to adequate eda tools many of which are licensed from the company s current or potential competitors  the price  quality and timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  the emergence of new ip component interchangeability standards  the widespread licensing of ip components by semiconductor manufacturers or their design groups to third party manufacturers  the ability of the company to protect its intellectual property  market acceptance of the company s ip components  success of competitive products  market acceptance of products using system on a chip ics and industry and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the emerging merchant ip component market

dependence on semiconductor manufacturers  dependence on semiconductor and electronics industries the company s success is substantially dependent both on the adoption of the company s technology by semiconductor manufacturers and on an increasing demand for products requiring complex system on a chip ics  such as portable computing devices  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers and workstations 
the company is subject to many risks beyond its control that influence the success of its customers  including  among others  competition faced by each customer in its particular industry  market acceptance of the customer s products that incorporate the company s technology  the engineering  sales and marketing capabilities of the customer  and the financial and other resources of the customer 
demand for the company s products may also be affected by mergers in the semiconductor and systems industries  which may reduce the aggregate level of purchases of the company s products and services by the combined companies 
faltering growth in the semiconductor and systems industries  a reduced number of designs starts  shifts in the types of integrated circuits manufactured  tightening of customers operating budgets or consolidation among the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor and electronics products industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  short product life cycles  fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures 
each of these industries is highly cyclical and has periodically experienced significant downturns  often in connection with or in anticipation of declines in general economic conditions during which the number of new ic design projects often decreases 
revenue from licenses of the company s products is influenced by the level of design efforts by its customers  and factors negatively affecting these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition may fluctuate in the future from period to period as a consequence of general economic conditions in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
customer concentration  limited customer base the company has been dependent on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of its annual revenue  although the customers composing this group have changed from time to time

the company anticipates that its revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts and the number of designs utilizing the company s products 
none of the company s customers has a written agreement with the company that obligates it to license future generations of products or new products  and there can be no assurance that any customer will license ip components from the company in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the company s customers will ship products incorporating the company s technology or that  if such shipments occur  they will generate significant revenue 
the loss of one or more of the company s major customers  reduced orders by one or more of such customers  the failure of one or more customers to pay license or royalty fees due to the company or the failure of a customer to ship products containing the company s ip components could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition may also be materially adversely affected if customers experience project delays and or new or existing customers delay new bookings or fail to place anticipated orders 
the company faces numerous risks in successfully obtaining orders from customers on terms consistent with the company s business model  including  among others  the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential customer before reaching an agreement with such party to license the company s products  persuading large semiconductor manufacturers to work with  to rely for critical technology on  and to disclose proprietary information to a smaller company  such as the company and persuading potential customers to bear certain development costs associated with development of customized components 
there are a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers to which the company can license its technology in a manner consistent with its business model and there can be no assurance that such manufacturers will rely on merchant ip components or adopt the company s products

lengthy sales cycle and design process the license of the company s products typically involves a significant commitment of capital by the customer and a purchase will often be timed to coincide with a customer s migration to a new manufacturing process 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available ip solutions and require the company to expend substantial time  effort and resources to educate them about the value of the company s products 
a variety of factors  including factors over which the company has little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor an alternate solution or to delay or forego a license of the company s products 
as a result of these and other factors  the sales cycle for the company s products is long  typically ranging from six to months 
the company s ability to forecast the timing and scope of specific sales is limited  and delay of or failure to complete one or more large contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition and could cause the company s operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
once the company receives and accepts an order from a customer  the company must commit significant resources to customizing its products for the customer s manufacturing process 
this customization is complex and time consuming and is subject to a number of risks over which the company has little or no control  including the customer s adjustments and alterations of its manufacturing process or the timing of migration to a new process 
typically  this customization takes from three to six months to complete 
delays in product customization could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition and could cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
risks associated with international customers historically  a substantial portion of the company s total revenue has been international revenue 
in fiscal  and  international revenue  primarily in asia and europe  represented  and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company anticipates that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of its total revenue in the future 
to date  all of the revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
in the event that the company s competitors denominate their sales in a currency that becomes relatively inexpensive in comparison to the us dollar  the company may experience fewer orders from international customers whose business is based primarily on the less expensive currency 
there can be no assurance that present or future dislocations with respect to international financial markets will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company intends to continue to expand its sales and marketing activities in asia and europe 
the company s expansion of its international business involves a number of risks including the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  political and economic instability  exchange rate fluctuations  longer accounts receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  reduced or limited protection for intellectual property rights  export license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase revenue derived from international customers or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

new product development and technological change the company s customers compete in the semiconductor industry  which is subject to rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and requirements and evolving industry standards 
the development of new manufacturing processes  the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend on its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce new products that satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and that keep pace with new product introductions  emerging manufacturing process technologies and other technological developments in the semiconductor industry 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in manufacturing processes or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of new or enhanced products or that such new or enhanced products will achieve market acceptance 
any delay in release dates of new or enhanced products could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company could also be exposed to litigation or claims from its customers in the event that it does not satisfy its delivery commitments 
there can be no assurance that any such claim would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

dependence on key personnel the company s success depends in large part on the continued contributions of its key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
none of the company s senior management or key technical personnel is bound by an employment contract 
in addition  the company does not currently maintain key man life insurance covering its key personnel 
the company believes that its success depends to a significant extent on the ability of its management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
the company must also attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and finance personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of the services of any key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

management of growth the ability of the company to license its products and manage its business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
the company s rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
from september  to september   the company grew from to employees and full time equivalents 
the company s customers rely heavily on the company s technological expertise in designing  testing and manufacturing products incorporating the company s ip components 
relationships with new customers generally require significant engineering support 
as a result  any increase in the demand for the company s products will increase the strain on the company s personnel  particularly its engineers 
the company s financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures are also limited 
although some new controls  systems and procedures have been implemented  the company s future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  together with maintaining effective cost controls  and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties and must successfully implement its royalty business model 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that the company s management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to offer its services and products successfully and to implement its business plan 
the company s inability to manage any future growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

risks associated with protection of intellectual property the company relies primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect its proprietary rights 
failure of the company to enforce its patents  trademarks or copyrights or to protect its trade secrets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications will be approved  that any issued patents will protect the company s intellectual property or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
from time to time  third parties  including competitors of the company  may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that the company would prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial cost and would divert resources of the company 
any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company has elected to rely on trade secret law rather than patent law to protect its proprietary technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
the company protects its proprietary technology and processes  in part  through confidentiality agreements with its employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that these contracts will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
in addition  effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitors of the company  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  do not have  or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the united states or in international markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the uspto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  uspto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
any such suit or proceeding involving the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the company intends to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to its existing products 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which the company s existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the level and timing of license revenue  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
the company believes that its current cash and investment balances and any cash generated from operations and from available or future debt financing will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  from time to time  the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies or products 
the failure of the company to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

potential volatility of stock price the trading price of the company s common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in the company s results of operations  announcements regarding the company s product developments  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company  its customers or competitors  release of reports by securities analysts  changes in security analysts recommendations  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
also  at some future time  the company s revenues and results of operations may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors  resulting in significant fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and which often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against that company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and would at a minimum divert management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject the company to significant liabilities
