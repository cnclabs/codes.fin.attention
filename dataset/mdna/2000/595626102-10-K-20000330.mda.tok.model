item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal periods indicated  selected financial information as a percentage of total sales and revenues 
percentage of sales and revenues fiscal year replacement parts sales company operated shop retail sales royalties real estate rental revenues other sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues selling  general and administrative expenses operating income before business transformation costs business transformation costs operating income loss other income expense  net interest expense income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss introduction beginning in and carrying forward into  the company began to experience declines in earnings and returns on assets and equity 
these trends were due to a combination of slow growth  increasing operating expenses and an expanding asset base 
the company also began to experience declines in sales and revenues from certain business activities including substantial declines in exhaust sales at both the retail and wholesale level due to the automobile manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems 
these trends  coupled with an expected substantial increase in the company s long term debt as a result of the spin off of midas as an independent company by whitman corporation  led management to conduct an in depth review of current strategies and potential alternative strategies to reverse these trends 
forthcoming from this strategic review was a business strategy to focus the company s management and financial resources on expanding the north american and european franchise network by adding new shops  improving relationships with franchisees  improving the efficiency of the wholesale replacement part distribution system  reducing operating expenses and redeploying assets by franchising company operated shops 
the strategy also called for the introduction of new midas products and services at the retail level to offset the declines in the exhaust business 
in  the company reached an agreement with magneti marelli  spa  a member of the fiat group  to form a strategic alliance to accelerate the development of the midas system in europe and south america 
midas management concluded that magneti marelli had the financial and human resources to accelerate the development of the midas business in europe and south america at a much faster pace than the company 
midas management also concluded that the proceeds from a transaction with magneti marelli could provide the company with additional financial resources which would enable the company to accelerate the execution of its strategy to transform and grow the north american franchise network 
accordingly  midas sold its interests in europe and south america to magneti marelli for million in october  and entered into a licensing agreement for the midas trademarks and know how as a part of the transaction 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s business strategy was further modified to the current strategy  which is to become a focused and efficient operator of a north american franchise  a wholesale parts distribution network and a licensor of midas trademarks outside of north america 
the business transformation process resulted in costs which are summarized in the following table in millions 
fiscal year franchisee incentive payments disposition of company operated shops corporate office relocation integration of canadian administration function consolidation of north american distribution system special one time return program changes to us franchisee advertising us asset write downs to recognize impairments severance and other costs business transformation costs before taxes income taxes benefit business transformation costs  net of taxes additional information regarding each of the business transformation costs listed in the above summary is presented in note to the financial statements 
because of changes in the company s business strategy  the type of operational  legal and financial control of the midas shops changed substantially in the method of operation of the shops in operation at the end of fiscal  and  is presented below 
midas retail shops fiscal year end franchised and licensed    company operated total    although the total number of shops in operation remained relatively constant over the past years  the number of shops operated by the company declined by shops since the end of fiscal  and the number of shops operating under a franchise or license agreement increased by shops 
this shift in the type of shop operation reflects the sale of midas europe and the strategy to focus on franchising 
the approximately  midas shops currently in operation worldwide offer some or all of the following services exhaust  brake  suspension  air conditioning  batteries and a number of other routine maintenance services 
the company s business strategy is to expand these service offerings in the future 
the remaining company operated shops as of january  represents the company s australian operations and a training facility located in palatine  illinois 
the business strategy of focusing the company on growing the north american franchisee network is expected to have a significant impact on the future sources of revenue for the company
