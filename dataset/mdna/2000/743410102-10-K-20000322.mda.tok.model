distribution and dividend requirements prologis current distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders based upon what it considers to be a reasonable percentage of cash flow and at the level that will allow prologis to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  annual distributions are expected to be consistently higher than annual earnings 
cash distributions paid in  and were per common share  per common share and per common share  respectively 
on december   prologis declared a distribution of per common share which was paid on february  the board has set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
the payment of distributions is subject to the discretion of the board and is dependent upon the financial condition and operating results of prologis and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
on may   prologis paid a common distribution to holders of meridian common stock as of march  this distribution  which was declared by the meridian board of directors prior to the closing of the meridian merger  related to the first quarter of and aggregated million 
this liability was assumed by prologis in connection with the meridian merger 

see results of operations meridian merger 
the annual dividend rates on prologis preferred shares are per series a preferred share  per series b preferred share  per series c preferred share  per series d preferred share and per series e preferred share 
on april   prologis paid an aggregate dividend of million on the series e preferred shares per share of which  related to meridian s series d preferred stock and was accrued by meridian prior to the closing of the meridian merger 
see results of operations meridian merger 
pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares  prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to the common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
conversion to the euro effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european monetary union launched the new monetary unit  the euro  as the single currency for the member countries of the european monetary union 
during the period from january  to january   a transition period will be in effect during which time the euro will be available for non cash transactions 
however  transactions can continue to be denominated in the old national currencies 
after january   all transactions must be denominated in the euro 
the targeted exchange rates of the old national currencies to the euro were determined in may conversion to the euro has not had  nor is management aware of any future effects of the conversion to the euro that will have  a material impact on its business operations or results of operations 
new tax legislation the reit modernization act rma  which was passed in and will take effect on january   modifies certain provisions of the code with respect to the taxation of reits 
primarily  the rma allows for the creation of taxable reit subsidiaries trs which will allow prologis and other reits to own up to of a trs previously limited to of the voting stock 
due to the previous limitations  certain of prologis current taxable subsidiaries those entities whose operations generated income that was restricted under the reit rules were formed as entities in which prologis owned of the preferred stock and a third party owned of the voting common stock 
accordingly  prologis accounted for these investments excluding prologis development services which is consolidated under the equity method rather than consolidating the investments in its balance sheet and results of operations 
because prologis will be able to own of these entities beginning on january   prologis is pursuing the purchase of the common stock of these entities from the third parties currently owning the stock 
see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares increased million to million for from million for funds from operation attributable to common shares increased million from to funds from operations does not represent net income or cash from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  which is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
prologis considers funds from operations to be a useful supplemental measure of comparative period operating performance and as a supplemental measure to assist management  financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders with an indication of the ability of prologis to fund its capital expenditures and investment activities and to fund other cash needs 
the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits because many reits  including prologis  compute funds from operations in a manner different from the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
for the three year period ended december  presented below  funds from operations  as published by nareit is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of previously depreciated property  extraordinary or unusual items as defined by gaap and significant non recurring items that materially distort the comparative measurement of company performance over time  plus depreciation and amortization unique to the real estate industry  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
the adjustments for unconsolidated entities are computed to reflect their funds from operations on the same basis 
funds from operations as used by prologis is modified from the nareit definition to exclude i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses of prologis taxable subsidiaries  ii foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between prologis and its consolidated and unconsolidated entities  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of third party debt of prologis foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities  and iv mark to market adjustments related to derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis foreign currency risks 
additionally  prologis includes gains or losses on the disposition of real estate utilized in prologis non cdfs business in funds from operations 
these adjustments to the nareit definition are made to reflect prologis funds from operations on a comparable basis with the other reits who to not engage in the types of transactions that give rise to these items

year overview the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
prior to december   prologis completed a review of all of its computer systems and applications to determine if these programs were year compliant 
prologis did not identify any computer system or applications that  upon failure to be year compliant  would have had a material adverse impact on its business or results of operations 
prior to and after january  prologis and its unconsolidated entities csi  frigoscandia and prologis kingspark have not experienced any disruptions in their business operations related to the year issue 
accordingly  year problems have not materially impacted the financial condition  liquidity or results of operations of prologis and its unconsolidated entities as reported through december  further  year issues are not expected to materially impact the financial condition  liquidity or results of operations of prologis and its unconsolidated entities after december  therefore  prologis and its unconsolidated entities have not recorded any accruals for contingent losses related to year issues 
there can be no assurances that year related issues will not still have a material adverse effect on prologis  its business and its financial condition or on the business and financial condition of prologis unconsolidated entities 
however  prologis believes its year compliance program has reduced the level of uncertainty about the year impact in areas that are within its direct control and management of prologis believes that the possibility of any future interruptions of normal operations is remote 
prologis activities with respect to its assessment of year compliance and its remediation efforts have been performed primarily by existing personnel 
prologis historical costs for addressing the year issue are not material and management does not anticipate any future costs associated with the year issue 
third party costs and interim software solutions for year issues have not exceeded  prologis does not separately track the internal costs incurred for year compliance issues 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs of its it group 
although the cost associated with the replacement of prologis key property management and core accounting systems that was completed in was substantial  the replacements were made to improve operational efficiency and were not accelerated due to the year issue 
prologis did not delay any material projects as a result of the year issue 
funds expended to address year issues were made from operating cash flow 
the total costs incurred for year remediation was less than  for csi  approximately million for frigoscandia and less than  for prologis kingspark 
no future costs are expected to be incurred 
prologis and its unconsolidated entities believe that year issues have not and will not materially effect the their historic spending patterns or cost relationships 
additionally  prologis believes that the revenue patterns of it and its unconsolidated entities have not and will not be effected by year related problems 
risk factors risks factors include the occurrence of any of the events described below that could adversely affect prologis ability to achieve its projected returns on acquisitions and projects under development and could hinder prologis ability to make expected distributions to equity holders 
prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions of the markets in which it owns property prologis operating performance depends on the economic conditions of markets in which its facilities are concentrated 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for industrial distribution facilities  in prologis larger markets become less favorable relative to other geographic areas 
any material oversupply of space or material reduction of demand for space could adversely effect prologis operating income and the value of the common shares 
prologis investments are subject to risks particular to real estate value of real estate dependent on numerous factors real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
real estate values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance  the ability of the owner to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  and other laws 
restrictions on  and risks of  unsuccessful development activities prologis intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals 
prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with any such development activities 
these risks include the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated  limited cash flow during the construction period  and the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable 
in case of an unsuccessful development project  prologis loss could exceed its investment in the project 
tenant default prologis income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their obligations to prologis  or if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its industrial distribution facilities 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlords 
real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets and therefore may tend to limit the ability of prologis to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules  relating to the number of properties sold in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the properties  or meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability to sell assets at any time to change its asset base may be restricted 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate  which could adversely affect the market price of such common shares 
a decrease in the market price of the common shares could reduce prologis ability to raise additional equity capital in the public markets 
uninsured losses may adversely affect prologis some types of losses  such as from acts of war  may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs  prologis could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the affected facility  but would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage indebtedness on the facility 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
the presence of such substances on prologis properties may adversely affect its ability to sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may also have an adverse affect on prologis ability to pay distributions to its shareholders 
debt financing  increases in interest rates  financial covenants and absence of limitations on debt may result in decreased distribution to shareholders debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments or principal and interest and the risk that prologis will not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancings will not be as favorable as terms of the existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
requirements of credit facilities  foreclosures the terms of prologis indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios  maintaining insurance coverage  etc 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
no limitations on debt prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only  if upon such incurrence  prologis debt to book capitalization ratio  as adjusted  would equal or less 
the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if  for example  it were necessary in order for prologis to continue to qualify as a reit under the code 
if this policy were changed  prologis could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders 
failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the limited available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and developments at prologis  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate tax liabilities could materially reduce the funds available for distribution to prologis shareholders or for reinvestment 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gain in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to prologis shareholders at least of its ordinary taxable income  excluding net capital gains changed to as a result of the rma see new tax legislation 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell facilities on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be a reit 
currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the u 
s 
dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currencies of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis performance 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects through the use of foreign currency hedge contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 
influence of prologis principal shareholder may impact prologis management and operations prologis and security capital are parties to a third amended and restated investor agreement  dated as of september  pursuant to the investor agreement  security capital has the right  so long as it owns between and of the common shares  to nominate one person to the board 
so long as security capital owns or more of the common shares  security capital will be entitled to nominate a proportionate number of persons to the board subject to a maximum of three nominees if the size of the board does not increase above the current size of ten trustees 
under the investor agreement  so long as it owns at least of the common shares  security capital also has the right of prior approval with respect to the following matters the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities  other than issuances in connection with option  dividend reinvestment and similar plans  for less than the fair market value of such securities  the issuance of any preferred shares which would result in the fixed charge coverage ratio being less than to  adopting any employee benefit plans under which common shares may be issued  the compensation of senior officers of prologis  and the incurrence of additional indebtedness which would result in the interest expense coverage ratio being less than to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
on a limited basis  prologis uses certain derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce its market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance with board approved policies 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as the potential loss in future earnings and cash flow with respect to interest rate exposure and future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure of its market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk is related primarily to its variable rate credit facilities 
prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objective  prologis primarily borrows on a fixed rate basis 
therefore  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate unsecured lines of credit and its variable rate short term borrowing arrangements 
prologis substantially eliminates the interest rate risk generated by longer term variable rate debt by fixing the interest payments with interest rate swap agreements 
prologis had million longer term variable rate debt outstanding as of december  prologis has substantially fixed the interest payments on this debt with interest rate swap agreements 
in addition  prologis has in the past and may in the future  utilize derivative instruments as hedges in anticipation of future fixed rate debt transactions to manage interest rate exposure 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate unsecured lines of credit and million on its variable rate short term borrowing arrangement 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for interest rate related financial instruments was approximately million on both future earnings and cash flow as of december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve 
foreign currency risk prologis uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense from foreign entities 
prior to september  prologis did not hedge projected net operating income from foreign entities with derivative contracts because it was not material relative to prologis total net operating income 
in addition  prologis incurs foreign currency risk related to its us dollar denominated loans to its foreign consolidated subsidiaries 
the remeasurement of intercompany loans results in foreign currency exchange gains or losses which are recognized by prologis 
however  prologis does not incur an actual cash gain or loss until the loans are repaid 
prologis exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  british pound sterling and swedish krona 
prologis foreign currency exchange sensitivity analysis included foreign currency forward and options contracts and other financial instruments affected by foreign currency exchange risk  as well as us dollar denominated loans to foreign consolidated entities 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated year end market risk exposure to future earnings was million 
the sensitivity analysis excluded the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates on the underlying projected net operating income  which has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it 
however  since prologis hedges approximately of its projected net operating income from foreign entities  approximately of the impact to total net operating income of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments
