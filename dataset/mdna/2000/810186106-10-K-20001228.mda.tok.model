item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scotts is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in the united states and europe 
during fiscal  our operations were divided into three business segments north american consumer  north american professional and international 
the north american consumer segment includes the consumer lawns  consumer gardens  consumer growing media  consumer ortho and consumer canada business groups 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus on our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  to create demand to pull product through the retail distribution channels 
during fiscal  we spent million on advertising and promotional activities  which is a significant increase over fiscal spending levels of million 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus over the past several years  and we believe that scotts continues to receive a significant return on these increased marketing expenditures 
for example  sales in our consumer lawns business group increased from fiscal to fiscal  after having experienced double digit percentage increases in sales during the prior two years 
we believe that this dramatic sales growth resulted primarily from our increased consumer oriented marketing efforts 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and increase consumer marketing expenditures across all of our consumer businesses  driving increased sales through market share and category growth 
scotts sales are seasonal in nature and are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales but can create increased demand for pesticides 
periods of dry  hot weather can have the opposite effect on fertilizer and pesticide sales 
we believe that our recent acquisitions diversify both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
on september   scotts entered into a long term marketing agreement with monsanto for its consumer roundup r herbicide products 
under the marketing agreement  scotts and monsanto will jointly develop global consumer and trade marketing programs for roundup r 
scotts has assumed responsibility for sales support  merchandising  distribution and logistics 
in addition  in january  scotts purchased from monsanto the assets of its worldwide consumer lawn and garden businesses  exclusive of the roundup r business  for million 
these transactions with monsanto further our strategic objective of significantly enhancing our position in the pesticides segment of the consumer lawn and garden category 
these businesses make up the consumer ortho business group within the north american consumer segment 
we believe that these transactions provide us with several strategic benefits including immediate market penetration  geographic expansion  brand leveraging opportunities and the achievement of substantial cost savings 
with the ortho acquisition  we believe we are currently a leader by market share in all five segments of the consumer lawn and garden category in north america lawn fertilizer  garden fertilizer  growing media  grass seeds and pesticides 
we believe that we are now positioned as the only company with a complete offering of consumer lawn and garden products in the united states 
over the past several years  we have made several other acquisitions to strengthen our global market position in the lawn and garden category 
in october  we purchased rhone poulenc jardin  a leading european lawn and garden business  from rhone poulenc for approximately million excluding access rights to certain research and development acquired for million 
this acquisition provided a significant addition to our existing european platform and strengthened our foothold in the continental european consumer lawn and garden market 
through this acquisition  we have established a strong presence in france  germany  austria and the benelux countries 
in december  we acquired asef holdings bv  a privately held netherlands based lawn and garden products company 
in february  we acquired earthgro  inc  a northeastern us growing media producer 
in december  we acquired levington group limited  a leading producer of consumer and professional lawn fertilizer and growing media in the united kingdom 
in january  we acquired the approximate two thirds interest in miracle holdings limited which scotts did not already own 
miracle holdings owns miracle garden care limited  a manufacturer and distributor of lawn and garden products in the united kingdom 
these acquisitions are consistent with our stated objective of becoming the world s foremost branded lawn and garden company 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
dollars are in millions except per share data 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the three years ended september  fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit commission earned from agency agreement  net advertising and promotion selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other intangibles restructuring and other charges other income expense  net income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income before extraordinary items extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt net income dividends on class a convertible preferred stock income applicable to common shareholders the following table sets forth net sales by business segment for the three years ended september  north american consumer consumer lawns consumer gardens consumer growing media consumer ortho consumer canada total   north american professional international consolidated    fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales of billion 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that the ortho acquisition had occurred on october   net sales for fiscal were higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal the increase in net sales from year to year was driven by significant increases in net sales across all businesses in the north american consumer segment  partially offset by decreases in net sales in the north american professional and international segments as discussed below 
north american consumer segment net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over net sales for fiscal of billion 
net sales in the consumer lawns business group increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to a significant increase in sales to and consumer takeaway from national home centers 
net sales in the consumer gardens business group increased million  or  primarily driven by strong net sales and market share performance in the water soluble and tree spikes product lines and the successful introduction of new products such as miracle gro r garden weed prevent now known as miracle gro r garden weed preventer tm line in fiscal net sales in the consumer growing media business group increased million  or  due to strong category and market share growth  particularly for value added products such as miracle gro tm potting soils 
sales in the consumer ortho business group increased million  or  on an actual basis and million  or  on a pro forma basis  reflecting significantly improved volume with home center retailers and improved category and market share performance on the selective weed control product lines 
net sales for the consumer ortho business group were negatively impacted by the voluntary product return of the registered pesticide ortho r home defense r indoor outdoor insect killer  sold with the pull n spray r pump dispenser  the phasing out of products containing the active ingredient dursban and reduced selling efforts by a primary distributor prior to its termination on september  selling price changes did not have a significant impact on net sales in the north american consumer segment for fiscal north american professional segment net sales of million in fiscal were million lower than fiscal net sales of million 
in fiscal  the north american professional segment consisted of two businesses the proturf r business which provides turf care products to golf courses  athletic fields and related facilities and the horticulture business which provides plant care products to professional nurseries and growers 
the decrease in net sales for the north american professional segment was primarily due to lower net sales of proturf r products and the sale of the proturf r business during the third quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we changed from selling direct to customers to selling through distributors 
the timing of this change and performance issues with one of our largest proturf r distributors caused sales to decrease when compared to the prior year for the period prior to the sale of the business 
net sales of horticulture products within this segment were slightly improved compared to the prior year 
international segment net sales of million in fiscal were million lower than net sales for fiscal of million 
excluding the adverse impact of changes in exchange rates  net sales for the international segment increased compared to the prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to improved results in the segment s continental european consumer businesses and the international professional business  partially offset by decreases in the segment s uk consumer business caused by significant product rationalization and unusually poor weather 
gross profit increased to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal gross profit of million  driven by the increase in year to date net sales discussed above and a slight increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for fiscal compared to of net sales for fiscal this increase in profitability on net sales was driven by a shift to direct distribution to certain retail accounts  improved product mix toward higher margin  value added products and improved efficiencies in scott s production plants  offset by increased urea  fuel and other raw material costs and a significant erosion in the profitability of the proturf r business prior to its sale 
the gross commission from agency agreement in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in the gross commission from year to year was driven by significantly higher sales of roundup r worldwide year over year 
the gross commission earned under the agreement is based on the ebit as defined by the agreement generated each program year by the global roundup r business 
contribution expenses under agency agreement were million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in contribution expenses was due to an increase in the contribution payment to monsanto now pharmacia and an increase of million in the amortization of the million marketing fee paid to monsanto as a result of correcting the amortization period from to years 
the million of additional amortization represents the additional amortization of million that was not recognized in fiscal and additional amortization of million for fiscal advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of over fiscal advertising and promotion expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and promotion expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to continued emphasis on increasing advertising and promotion expenses to drive revenue growth within the north american consumer segment and investments in advertising and promotion to drive future sales growth in the international segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of over fiscal expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal and fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to additional costs needed to support the increased net sales levels in the north american consumer business groups  infrastructure expenses within the international segment  selling  general and administrative expenses for the consumer ortho business group which were not incurred in the first quarter of fiscal due to the timing of the acquisition in january  and increased legal costs as a result of the various legal matters discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal amortization of million 
this increase was primarily due to fiscal not reflecting a full year of amortization related to the ortho acquisition since the acquisition occurred in january restructuring and other charges were million in fiscal these charges represent severance costs associated with the reorganization of the north american professional business group to strengthen distribution and technical sales support  integrate brand management across market segments and reduce annual operating expenses 
substantially all payments have been made 
there were no restructuring charges incurred in fiscal other income in fiscal was million compared to other income of million in the prior year 
the increase in other income  on a net basis  was primarily due to the million gain resulting from the sale of the proturf r business  partially offset by costs incurred in connection with scotts voluntary return program for the registered pesticide ortho r home defense r indoor outdoor insect killer  sold with the pull n spray r pump dispenser and additional losses on disposals of miscellaneous fixed assets 
income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in income from operations was due primarily to the increase in net sales across the north american consumer business groups as noted above  partially offset by the decrease in net sales in the north american professional segment 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings to fund the ortho acquisition and an increase in average borrowing rates under our credit facility  partially offset by reduced working capital requirements 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
scotts effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to for the previous year 
the decrease in the tax rate for fiscal is due primarily to a reversal of million of tax reserves upon resolution of certain outstanding tax matters during the third quarter of fiscal and a reduction in the base tax rate for the year  before reversal of reserves  to 
the base tax rate reduction is primarily a result of the favorable treatment of a permanent tax difference associated with percentage depletion accounting 
in conjunction with the ortho acquisition  in january scotts completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under our credit facility  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and repurchase approximately of the then outstanding million senior subordinated notes due august we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of the notes of million including a call premium of million and the write off of unamortized issuance costs and discounts of million 
scotts reported net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million for fiscal  or per common share on a diluted basis 
the diluted earnings per share for fiscal is net of a one time reduction of per share resulting from the early conversion of class a convertible preferred stock in october the diluted earnings per share for fiscal is net of a per share charge associated with the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt discussed above 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal sales of billion 
on a pro forma basis  assuming that the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin  levington and earthgro acquisitions had occurred on october   pro forma net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase over fiscal pro forma net sales of billion 
as discussed below  the increase in net sales on a pro forma basis was primarily driven by exceptional growth in the consumer lawns business group and strong revenue growth within the consumer gardens and consumer growing media business groups 
north american consumer segment net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of nearly over fiscal net sales of million and an increase of over fiscal on a pro forma basis 
net sales in the consumer lawns business group within this segment were million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal net sales of million 
the continued dramatic revenue growth in the consumer lawns business group was driven by increases in consumer oriented marketing efforts such as advertising  consumer research and packaging improvements  which increased category growth and scotts market share 
net sales in the consumer gardens business group increased to million in fiscal due to several successful new product introductions and the extension of the advertising season for all purpose miracle gro r 
net sales in the consumer growing media business group increased to million  or on a pro forma basis 
significantly higher levels of advertising and promotional spending drove this revenue growth which resulted in increased net sales for value added potting soils in particular 
net sales in the consumer ortho business group were million in fiscal which is an increase of on a pro forma basis 
north american professional segment net sales were million in fiscal  a decrease of from fiscal the decrease in fiscal net sales in this segment was reflected in the proturf r business  which changed its distribution model earlier in the year  electing to market and deliver products through distributors rather than directly to customers 
short term interruptions associated with this change and the discontinuance of certain commodity products resulted in lower net sales volumes in fiscal international segment net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily the result of the rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions in fiscal the increase in net sales on a pro forma basis was  which was primarily due to revenue growth in the european professional and rhone poulenc jardin businesses  partially offset by a net sales decline in the uk consumer business caused by supply chain interruptions resulting from the integration of the recently acquired businesses 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  pro forma net sales in fiscal would have been higher than fiscal selling price changes did not have a significant impact on scotts results of operations for fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal on a pro forma basis  gross profit in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million in fiscal  or of net sales 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was driven by improved raw material costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher volumes in fiscal fiscal gross profit also reflected the following charges restructuring and other charges of million as discussed below  start up costs of million associated with the upgrade of certain domestic manufacturing facilities  demolition costs of million associated with the removal of certain old manufacturing facilities  unplanned production outsourcing costs of million  the loss of a composting contract of million  and unfavorable inventory adjustments of million 
the gross commission earned from agency agreement in fiscal of million was generated from our marketing agreement with monsanto for exclusive domestic and international marketing and agency rights to monsanto s consumer roundup r herbicide products 
advertising and promotion expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million over fiscal advertising and promotion expenses of million 
the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses contributed million and million  respectively  to this increase 
the remaining increase reflects continued emphasis on building consumer demand through consumer oriented marketing efforts  and is highlighted by  and increases in advertising and promotional spending in the consumer lawns  consumer gardens and consumer growing media business groups  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and promotion expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses contributed million and million  respectively  to this increase 
the significant components of the remaining million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses are additional information systems expenses of million for year remediation and million for enterprise resource planning implementation efforts  increased bad debt expenses of million  primarily resulting from the bankruptcy of hechinger  increased marketing  selling and administrative costs within the consumer lawns  consumer gardens and consumer growing media business groups of million to support higher sales volumes  costs of million associated with changes in distribution arrangements in france  costs to integrate the ortho business of million  increased research and development spending of million  largely in support of the acquired ortho business  and increased legal and environmental charges of million  primarily for costs associated with the environmental matter at our marysville site 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to additional intangibles resulting from the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal were million  which represents severance costs associated with the change in distribution methods within the proturf r business of the north american professional segment 
in connection with this restructuring  approximately in house sales associates were terminated in fiscal approximately million of severance payments were made to these former associates during fiscal  million of the remaining million was paid in fiscal  and the remaining million is expected to be paid in fiscal restructuring and other charges in fiscal were million  million of which is identified separately within operating expenses  million of which is included in cost of sales and million of which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other income expense for fiscal was income of million compared to million of expense for fiscal other income in fiscal represented royalties received under license agreements for the use of some of our trademarks 
other expenses in fiscal represented losses on the sale of fixed assets and foreign currency  partially offset by royalty income described above 
legal and environmental provisions of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were reclassified from other income expense to selling  general and administrative expenses 
income from operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to operating income realized from the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses and significant improvements in the consumer lawns and consumer growing media business groups  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative and amortization expenses described above 
interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal interest expense of million 
the increase in interest expense was due to increased borrowings to fund the ortho  rhone poulenc jardin and asef acquisitions and higher working capital levels to support the growth of the businesses 
income tax expense for fiscal  was million compared to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in foreign dividends remitted which provided excess foreign tax credits in fiscal as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  in conjunction with the ortho acquisition  in january we completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under our credit facility  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and repurchase approximately of the outstanding million senior subordinated notes due august we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of the notes of million  including a call premium of million and the write off of unamortized issuance costs and discounts of million 
we reported net income of million for fiscal  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million for fiscal  or per share on a diluted basis 
excluding the impact of the extraordinary loss discussed above  earnings per share for fiscal were on a diluted basis 
excluding the impact of restructuring and other charges taken in fiscal as well as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  earnings per share for fiscal was on a diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the seasonal nature of our operations generally requires cash to fund significant increases in working capital primarily inventory and accounts receivable during the first and second quarters 
the third fiscal quarter is a period for collecting accounts receivable and reducing inventory levels 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to the prior year is attributable to a significant decrease in the amount of working capital required during the year as well as the payment of the roundup r marketing fee made in the first quarter of fiscal cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased the rhone poulenc jardin and asef businesses for approximately million excluding million for access rights acquired under a research and development agreement with rhone poulenc jardin 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased from monsanto the assets of its worldwide consumer lawn and garden businesses  exclusive of the roundup r business 
scotts made an initial payment of million at the acquisition date  and made an additional payment of million when the final purchase price of was determined in the third quarter of fiscal capital expenditures increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal financing activities required cash of million for fiscal compared to providing million in the prior year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  scotts borrowed funds under its credit facility in order to purchase the rhone poulenc jardin and asef businesses  to pay marketing fees associated with the roundup r marketing agreement  to pay financing fees associated with the new credit facility and to settle the then outstanding interest rate locks as described below 
in the second quarter of fiscal  scotts completed an offering of million of senior subordinated notes due august the net proceeds from this offering  together with borrowings under our credit facility  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and repurchase approximately of the then outstanding million senior subordinated notes due august due to the cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  scotts was able to make net repayments to its credit facility of million 
scotts also repurchased million of treasury shares during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal total debt was million as of september   a decrease of million compared with total debt at september  the decrease in total debt as of september  was primarily due to scheduled quarterly debt repayments on scotts term loans during fiscal  repayments on the revolving portion of scotts credit facility during fiscal  and the impact of weakening exchange rates on debt denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
the credit facility provides for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of billion and consists of term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
on december   we amended our current credit facility to refinance a portion of the term loan facilities and to increase the revolving credit facility to million 
see further description of the amendment to the credit facility in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we funded the acquisition of the rhone poulenc jardin and asef businesses with borrowings under our credit facility 
additional borrowings under the credit facility  along with proceeds from the january offering of million of senior subordinated notes due  were used to fund the ortho acquisition and to repurchase approximately of scotts then outstanding million senior subordinated notes due august coincidental with the notes offering  scotts settled its then outstanding interest rate locks for approximately million 
we entered into two interest rate locks in fiscal to hedge the anticipated interest rate exposure on the million note offering 
in october  we terminated one of the interest rate locks for million and entered into a new interest rate lock instrument 
the total amount paid under the interest rate locks of million has been deferred and is being amortized over the life of the notes 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal we estimate that capital expenditures will approximate million in each of fiscal and in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions on or prior to september  as of september    common shares or million have been repurchased under this repurchase program limit 
in october  the board of directors approved cancellation of the third year commitment of million under the share repurchase program 
the board did authorize repurchasing the amount still outstanding under the second year repurchase commitment approximately million through september  any repurchase will also be subject to the covenants contained in our credit facility as well as our other debt instruments 
the repurchased shares have been and will be held in treasury and will thereafter be used for the exercise of employee stock options and for other general corporate purposes 
in our opinion  cash flows from operations and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our business groups will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all  or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein and under item business environmental and regulatory considerations and item legal proceedings of our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  year readiness in fiscal  we did not experience any significant issues related to the ability of our information technology and business systems to recognize the year in addition  we did not experience any significant supply difficulties related to our vendors year readiness 
while we believe that we have taken adequate precautions against year systems issues  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter business interruption or other issues related to the year in the future 
enterprise resource planning in july  we announced a project designed to bring our information system resources in line with our current strategic objectives 
the project includes the redesign of many key business processes in connection with the installation of new software 
sap was selected as the primary software provider for this project 
as of october   all of the north american businesses with the exception of canada are operating under the new system 
through september   we spent approximately million on the project  approximately of which will be capitalized over a period of four to eight years 
we are currently evaluating when  and to what extent  the new information systems and applications will be implemented at our international locations 
euro a new currency called the euro has been introduced in certain economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we are in the process of developing our plans and contracts for work to be performed to implement utilization of the euro as required at our operations in continental europe 
we expect that a significant portion of the costs associated with this work will be incurred during fiscal  however  some costs will likely be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal as well 
we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management s outlook fiscal was another year of significant financial achievements for scotts  as we reported record net sales of billion  grew diluted earnings per share by at least for the fourth consecutive year on a pro forma basis  excluding extraordinary items and the impact of the early conversion of the class a convertible preferred stock and established or maintained what we believe to be the leading market share position in most of the significant lawn and garden categories across the world 
the strategic acquisitions during fiscal  most notably the ortho and rhone poulenc jardin businesses  were critical in providing us with significant market positions in the pesticides category as well as continental european lawn and garden markets 
during fiscal  we were able to achieve our financial results despite encountering unfavorable market trends such as rising raw material and fuel costs  increased interest rates and declining exchange rates against the us dollar in nearly all of the significant foreign countries in which we operate 
we anticipate that raw material and fuel costs will likely remain at their high levels or even increase further in fiscal to achieve our earnings targets for fiscal  we plan to continue our emphasis on consumer marketing to grow the categories and our market shares  pursue opportunities to recover raw material and fuel cost increases through increased manufacturing and distribution efficiencies enabled by our newly implemented north american enterprise resource planning system  consolidate and reorganize our north american sales force to better leverage sales and merchandising opportunities with our customers  and reduce the rate of increases in our selling  general and administrative costs 
strategically  fiscal s performance reflected the successful continuation of our emphasis on consumer oriented marketing efforts to pull demand through our distribution channels 
looking forward  we maintain the following broad tenets to our strategic plan promote and capitalize on the strengths of the scotts r  miracle gro r  hyponex r and ortho r industry leading brands  as well as our portfolio of powerful brands in our international markets 
this involves a commitment to our retail partners that we will support these brands through advertising and promotion unequaled in the lawn and garden consumables market 
in the professional categories  it signifies a commitment to customers to provide value as an integral element in their long term success  commit to continuously study and improve knowledge of the market  the consumer and the competition  simplify product lines and business processes  to focus on those that deliver value  evaluate marginal ones and eliminate those that lack future prospects  and achieve world leadership in operations  leveraging technology and know how to deliver outstanding customer service and quality 
scotts anticipates that we will continue to deliver significant revenue and earnings growth through emphasis on executing our strategic plan 
we believe that we can continue to generate annual sales growth of to in our core businesses and annual earnings growth of at least 
in addition  we have targeted improving our return on invested capital 
we believe that we can achieve our goal of realizing a return of on our invested capital our estimate of the average return on invested capital for our consumer products peer group in the next four years 
we expect to achieve this goal by reducing our overhead spending  tightening capital spending controls  implementing return on capital measures into our incentive compensation plans and accelerating operating performance and gross margin improvements utilizing our new enterprise resource planning capabilities in north america 
forward looking statements we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  in this form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
the forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  in this form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
periods of wet weather can slow fertilizer sales  while periods of dry  hot weather can decrease pesticide sales 
in addition  an abnormally cold spring throughout north america and or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and therefore our financial results 
our historical seasonality could impair our ability to make interest payments on indebtedness 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  approximately to of our net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and our borrowings peak near the end of our first fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand is insufficient to cover interest payments due on our indebtedness at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facilities  this seasonality could adversely affect our ability to make interest payments as required by our indebtedness 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
public perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  herbicides and pesticides  bearing one of our brands 
on occasion  customers allege that some of these products fail to perform up to expectations or cause damage or injury to individuals or property 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  damage our brand names and materially adversely affect our business 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
our substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
if we fail to comply with any of the financial or other restrictive covenants of our indebtedness  our indebtedness could become due and payable in full prior to its stated due date 
we cannot be sure that our lenders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash  which we may not be able to generate 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all 
we also cannot assure that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we might not be able to integrate our recent acquisitions into our business operations successfully 
we have made several substantial acquisitions in the past four years 
the acquisition of the ortho business represents the largest acquisition we have ever made 
the success of any completed acquisition depends on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business 
we believe that our recent acquisitions provide us with significant cost saving opportunities 
however  if we are not able to successfully integrate ortho  rhone poulenc jardin or our other acquired businesses  we will not be able to maximize such cost saving opportunities 
rather  the failure to integrate these acquired businesses  because of difficulties in the assimilation of operations and products  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the loss of key employees or other factors  could materially adversely affect our financial results 
because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of our top customers could adversely affect our financial results 
our top north american retail customers together accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  our top three customers  home depot  wal mart and kmart represented approximately  and of our fiscal net sales 
these customers hold significant positions in the retail lawn and garden market 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  kmart or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products  we would lose a substantial source of future earnings 
if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup r products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement rightfully  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of the significant source of earnings we believe the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive fiscal years 
monsanto may not terminate the marketing agreement  however  if we can demonstrate that the sales decline was caused by a severe decline of general economic conditions or a severe decline in the lawn and garden market in the region rather than by our failure to perform our duties under the agreement 
the expiration of patents relating to roundup r and the scotts turf builder r line of products could substantially increase our competition in the united states 
glyphosate  the active ingredient in roundup r  was subject to a patent in the united states that expired in september scotts cannot predict the success of roundup r now that glyphosate is no longer patented 
substantial new competition in the united states could adversely affect scotts 
glyphosate is no longer subject to patent in europe and is not subject to patent in canada 
while sales of roundup r in such countries have continued to increase despite the lack of patent protection  sales in the united states may decline as a result of increased competition 
any such decline in sales would adversely affect scotts financial results through the reduction of commissions as calculated under the roundup r marketing agreement 
our methylene urea product composition patent  which covers scotts turf builder r  scotts turf builder r with plus r with weed control and scotts turf builder r with halts r crabgrass preventer  is due to expire in july and could also result in increased competition 
any decline in sales of turf builder r products after the expiration of the methylene urea product composition patent could adversely affect our financial results 
the interests of the former miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of our other shareholders 
the former shareholders of stern s miracle gro products  inc  through hagedorn partnership  lp  beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common shares of scotts on a fully diluted basis 
the former miracle gro shareholders have sufficient voting power to significantly control the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
the interests of the former miracle gro shareholders could conflict with those of our other shareholders 
compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the united states environmental protection agency and  in many cases  similar state and or foreign agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides  which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us environmental protection agency usepa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in scotts products  which are also used on foods  will be evaluated by the usepa as part of this non dietary exposure risk assessment 
it is possible that the usepa or the active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide scotts uses in its products  would be limited or made unavailable to scotts 
for example  in june  dowagrosciences  an active ingredient registrant  voluntarily agreed to a gradual phase out of residential uses of dursban  an active ingredient used by scotts in its lawn and garden products 
in december  the usepa reached agreement with various parties  including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon  regarding a phased withdrawal of residential uses of products containing diazinon  used also by scotts in its lawn and garden products 
scotts cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the usepa s continuing evaluations 
management believes that scotts should be able to obtain substitute ingredients if selected pesticides are limited or made unavailable  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so for all products 
with regard to dursban  scotts has introduced  and with regard to diazinon  scotts expects to introduce  new pesticide products to meet consumer needs for pest control 
regulations regarding the use of some pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that the products be used only in specified locations 
users may be required to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied and may be required to notify individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to its intended use 
in some locations we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
since  we have been involved in litigation with the philadelphia district of the us army corps of engineers involving our peat harvesting operations at hyponex s lafayette  new jersey facility 
the corps of engineers is seeking a permanent injunction against harvesting and civil penalties in an unspecified amount 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  and air and water discharges from our facilities 
in june  the ohio environmental protection agency epa gave us formal notice of an enforcement action concerning our old  decommissioned wastewater treatment plants that had once operated at our marysville facility 
the ohio epa action alleges potential surface water violations relating to possible historical sediment contamination  inadequate treatment capabilities at our existing and currently permitted wastewater treatment plants and the need for corrective action under the resource conservation recovery act 
we are continuing to meet with the ohio epa and the ohio attorney general s office to negotiate an amicable resolution of these issues 
we are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
during fiscal  we made approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses  compared with approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses in fiscal management anticipates that environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses for fiscal will not differ significantly from those incurred in fiscal if we are required to significantly increase our actual environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses  it could adversely affect our financial results 
the implementation of the euro currency in some european countries between and could adversely affect us 
in january  the euro was introduced in some economic and monetary union emu countries and by  all emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro currency will have on the marketplace 
additionally  the european commission has not yet defined and finalized all of the rules and regulations with regard to the euro currency 
we are still assessing the impact the emu formation and euro implementation will have on our internal systems and the sale of our products 
we expect to take appropriate actions based on the results of our assessment 
however  we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue and there can be no assurance that this issue and its related costs will not have a material adverse effect on us or our operating results and financial condition 
our significant international operations make us more susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany and france 
our international operations have increased with the acquisitions of levington  miracle garden care limited  ortho and rhone poulenc jardin and with the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate our market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have various debt instruments outstanding at september  that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we have entered into the following interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates a million british pounds sterling notional amount swap to convert variable rate debt obligations denominated in british pounds sterling to a fixed rate 
the exchange rate used to convert british pounds sterling to us dollars at september  was gbp 
four interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million which are used to hedge certain variable rate obligations under our credit facility 
the credit facility requires that we enter into hedge agreements to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due and term loan facilities is subject to a fixed rate 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap on gbp libor average rate interest rate swaps on usd libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in foreign currencies 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of achieving our objectives or minimizing our risk exposures on these materials
