item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we derive our revenues primarily from one time and annual licenses with corporate  government  and oem customers and channel partners  software maintenance fees from site license agreements with corporate and government customers  one time fees for direct licenses to consumers  royalties  including initial nonrefundable royalties  from license arrangements with channel partners and oems  and professional service fees for services provided to licensees of our other products 
revenues from site license agreements generally consist of a one time license fee based on the number of individual users or servers licensed or to the extent of use of the software by the end user 
for each site license agreement  an annual software maintenance fee is calculated based upon a percentage of the applicable license fee 
payment of the maintenance fee permits customers to receive updates and enhancements to the software licensed for the duration of the maintenance agreement 
royalty revenues are earned in one of the following ways as a percentage of net revenues from product unit sales by licensees that incorporate our products  as a fixed per unit royalty  or as a regular periodic fee based on estimated shipments or usage over time 
professional service fees may include fees for training  installation  consulting  implementation support  software design and or development  and customization or modification of licensed software 
service fees are charged based on time and materials or on a fixed fee basis  and are recognized when the service has been provided 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside the united states 
such revenues totaled  and of total net revenue for the years ended january  and december  and  respectively 
we expect that the international market will continue to account for a significant portion of our total business 
our export revenues are transacted primarily in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that we are not exposed to significant risk with respect to changing currency exchange rates in connection with our business with international customers 
we generally denominate the prices for our corporate and end user products sold internationally in us dollars 
business with overseas end users may be subject to greater currency exchange rate risk in the future

the total of any adjustments is not expected to be material  and we believe that the escrow fund will be distributed in the first half of fiscal as a result of the net operating losses incurred in fiscal  and after evaluating the company s anticipated performance over its normal planning horizon  we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
the reported tax benefit was the result of net operating loss carrybacks available from taxes paid in prior years

sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  for from  for excluding the sales and marketing expenses associated with the assets sold to lernout hauspie  sales and marketing expenses increased  or  for compared to the increase was primarily the result of costs relating to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments as well as a charge of  related to an international distributor 
during  we entered into an international distribution agreement that provided the distributor with guaranteed levels of net receipts  as defined by the agreement  of  for each year ended december  and as of december   we believed that the distributor would not be able to achieve defined net receipts in either year 
therefore  the company recorded a charge to sales and marketing expenses of  excluding the sales and marketing expenses associated with the assets sold to lernout hauspie  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues for compared to for the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the aforementioned distributor charge

we adopted the straight line depreciation method for all equipment placed in service on or after january  the equipment under the straight line method is being depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets  generally three to five years 
we believe that the straight line method of depreciation provides a preferable matching between expected productivity and cost allocation since the equipment s operating capacity and consumption generally remains consistent over time

liquidity and capital resources our operating activities used cash of  for the year ended january   compared to providing cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreased contribution from operating activities of  from the calendar year to the fiscal year was due principally to the increased operating loss in the year ended january  compared to year ended december  significant factors in this lower level of earnings were the net payment for the insurance agreement with a major aaa rated insurance carrier  pursuant to which the insurance carrier assumed financial responsibly for the defense and ultimate resolution of the securities class action suits filed in february see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and the charges related to the fiscal restructuring actions and other special charges 
also contributing to the decreased cash from operations was the payment for the termination of a international distributor agreement see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

on april   the company announced that as part of its review of strategic alternatives  which began in february  the board of directors determined that the most appropriate means to enhance shareholder value is for the company to remain independent and to focus all of its energies on its dynabase dynamic web publishing system 
as a result  the company will pursue the divestiture of its other assets  including the information exchange division 
in line with this decision  the company will immediately begin a corporate reorganization designed to concentrate its operations in the dynabase business  which is a part of the ebusiness technologies ebt division 
as part of this management reorganization  the company will close its headquarters in boston during may and will consolidate all corporate functions in providence at ebt s current offices 
as a result  the majority of the boston based corporate personnel will leave the company in may  with a small number of personnel relocating to providence 
the company s board of directors has determined that the information exchange division should be separated from the dynabase business 
accordingly  the company is seeking acquirers for ied  which will be operated separately pending such a transaction

acquired in process research and development the company s january and calendar year acquisitions included certain material purchased in process research and development charges for venture labs  inc  sherpa systems corporation  and mediabank totaling  these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and therefore had no alternative future uses 
at the time of the acquisitions  the company engaged an independent appraiser to estimate the fair market value of the assets acquired  to serve as a basis for the allocation of the purchase price 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities necessary to establish that each product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
the values of the purchased in process research and development were based upon future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
the revenue estimates used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in the related technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the estimates used in valuing the in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
the assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variances may adversely affect the sales and profitability of future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets recorded at the time of the respective acquisitions may become impaired

year general many components of computers and the programs that run on them were designed with attention to only the last two digits of the calendar year 
any equipment or program recognizing only two digits may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue created risk for us from unforeseen problems in our products or our own computer systems and from third parties with whom we transact business worldwide 
prior to december   we commenced and completed a phased year compliance plan the plan which addressed the software we license and all software on which we depend  the hardware  operating systems and software on which we run our business and the third party services on which we also depend 
the costs were not material to our operations and total costs of implementing the plan were not material to our fiscal year results 
all of our hardware and software systems successfully transitioned to the year we have not experienced any significant problems as a result of the year issue with our own systems or those of our vendors 
however  the potential still exists for a non compliant system  either internally or at a vendor  to malfunction due to year issues and cause a disruption to our business 
due to the uncertain nature of this issue  we can not determine at this time whether the consequences of a potential year failure will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that  with the successful transition to the year  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be minimal 
inso products our products that we have continued to license in the year were tested for year compliance 
additionally  prior to december   we completed our assessment of the products that we license as components of products that we sell 
our current products are not considered date dependent 
some of our customers use products or product versions that we did not test  and do not support  for year compliance 
we have encouraged these customers to migrate to current products or versions that meet our year compliance definition 
in addition  we have not tested any of our custom code for year compliance 
although year problems may not become evident until long after january   we do not expect significant year related business disruptions in the future 
the costs of these efforts have not been material  however  there can be no assurances that we will not incur future material costs related to the year issue 
inso internal systems  facilities and external vendors we contacted all mission critical utility and facilities vendors on which we depend 
these vendors provided us with compliance statements certifying that they would be year compliant by the end of calendar despite our investigations of the year issue  it is possible that those certifications as well as the other representations we have obtained could be erroneous 
the cost of this effort and the projected completion costs have not been material 
however  we may experience future material unanticipated problems and costs by undetected errors of technology used in our internal it and non it systems 
we will continue to monitor our critical computer applications  and those of our vendors  to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
certain factors that may affect future operating results we intend to substantially increase our sales and marketing organization  especially in the ebt division 
this could burden our level of sales and marketing expenditures relative to revenues  which could lower our operating margins in future periods 
our ability to remain competitive in the computer software industry is dependent on the services of a number of key management and technical personnel  principally software engineers 
personnel costs for technical staff represent a significant portion of our operating expenses  and increased competition and related personnel cost increases for such staff could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  because of the recent drop in inso s stock price we may need to use larger amounts of cash to compensate our employees  rather than the equity incentives we have relied on in prior periods 
this could result in reduced operating margins as a result of higher personnel costs 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
the ebt division s market tends to be dominated by companies such as vignette  broadvision and interwoven  which have substantially greater development  marketing  sales and financial resources than we do 
because of our limited resources  in order to compete with these companies it is likely that we will be required to enter into relationships or agreements with systems integrators and other distribution partners 
the failure to create and foster such relationships could jeopardize our ability to compete in these markets 
we have invested significant development resources in products utilizing standards based publishing formats  such as xml  and we intend to invest significant resources in technologies and standards for the mobile and wireless market 
should large numbers of customers and potential customers not ultimately adopt such formats and standards  it is possible that there may be a limited market for the products we are currently developing  which could have an adverse impact on future revenues and operating results 
we have historically received a significant portion of our revenues from oems that integrate our products with their own products and market them to end users as a single unit 
the business of our oem customers is intensely competitive  while the computer software industry has continued to consolidate 
as a result  the number of potentially significant oem customers for our products has declined and there is increasing competitive pressure for our existing and potential customers to reduce costs 
as was the case in  it is possible that certain of the major operating system developers  including microsoft and symbian  may add features and functionality to such operating systems that may compete with our products or with those of our other oem customers 
the concentration of the market for operating systems makes it difficult or impossible for us or our other oem customers to compete on a price basis because purchasers of operating systems would be required to purchase products as part of the operating system that compete with our products 
in addition  certain oem customers  such as microsoft  may choose to internally develop products that compete with our products in order to reduce their costs 
we have relied on acquisitions to create growth and provide new technologies 
the majority of our revenues in fiscal were derived from businesses that were acquired by us during or thereafter  and it is anticipated that all our revenues will come from such acquired businesses in fiscal as a result of recent adverse trends in the price of our common stock  it may be more difficult for us to engage in acquisitions in the future  which could slow our revenue growth 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to integrate and manage successfully businesses or assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if our management is unable to manage such acquisitions effectively  the quality of our products  our ability to identify  hire  and retain key personnel  and the results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
during february  certain shareholders of inso filed two putative class action lawsuits against inso and certain of inso s officers and employees in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
while we believe that the claims are subject to meritorious defenses  which we plan to assert during the lawsuit  we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these actions at this time  and there can be no assurance that the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to increase the marketing of our products directly to customers outside the united states 
the marketing of products directly to customers outside the united states increases the risk to our revenues associated with fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
such fluctuations could also result in increased operating expenses associated with foreign operations 
our business could be harmed if the growth of the internet does not continue 
to the extent that businesses do not continue to adopt the internet as critical to their future plans  we may experience difficulty expanding our customer base 
further  the growth of the internet as a medium for business requires the acceptance and adoption of new paradigms for operating traditional businesses  and we cannot be certain that this will occur as rapidly or completely as we hope 
many companies have already invested substantial resources in other means of conducting commerce and exchanging information  and they may be unwilling to quickly move to internet based strategies to achieve these objectives 
even with substantial internet growth  it is possible that the existing and future internet infrastructure may not be able to support the additional demands placed upon it 
this could lead to delays in implementation of internet based technologies  including those we market 
future legislation or regulations could be enacted that directly or indirectly impact our ability to market our products  especially in the area of internet commerce 
it is impossible to predict if or how any future legislation or regulations would impact the internet and our business 
recent developments see item business recent developments for a discussion of inso s april  press release concerning the board of director s strategic decision to immediately begin a corporate reorganization designed to concentrate all of its operations in inso s dynabase business that is a part of the ebt division 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inso is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
our cash equivalents and available for sale investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments 
we manage the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio and investing in short term investment grade corporate securities  united states agency bonds  and asset backed securities 
in addition  we do not use investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
as of january   the analysis indicated that the change in interest income would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
additionally  the carrying value of our investments approximates the fair value and therefore the impact of a fluctuation in interest rates to the carrying value is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
however  actual interest income and gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  japan and australia  and therefore are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we primarily license our technology in us dollars but operating expenses are denominated in the local currency 
for fiscal  we do not believe we had significant exposure associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will evaluate the exposures going forward and will implement the appropriate risk management procedures as deemed necessary 
we had certain forward exchange contracts primarily british pounds sterling  german marks  italian lira  french francs  and swiss francs  which matured in january  with a notional amount outstanding of approximately  the estimated unrealized gains and losses for these forward exchange contracts were not material to our results of operations or financial position for fiscal we did not renew these contracts
