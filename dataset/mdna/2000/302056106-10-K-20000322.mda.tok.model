item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we had a challenging year with respect to revenue and earnings growth 
at the beginning of the year  we expected record breaking commercial satellite business from sti due to our support of the teledesic program 
our expectations changed  however  when teledesic experienced numerous delays 
as a result  we ceased working on the motorola strategic agreement 
we decided that we could not recover our complete investment in teledesic and that it was no longer financially prudent to continue to carry that asset on our books 
consequently  we wrote off approximately  and decided to close our facility supporting the project in mesa  arizona 
further  iridium  our flagship constellation and revenue producing project  filed for reorganization under the us bankruptcy laws during the third quarter 
as a result of these facts  our commercial satellite business declined significantly 
based on the decreasing sti government space services business  and our projections of revenues therefrom  we decided to replace our decreasing commercial and government satellite service revenue with it and enterprise engineering ee business thereby utilizing our core tracking and control engineering resources 
we were able to continue to grow our overall revenues in year over year  continue to invest in new product development  maintain positive cash flows and initiate an acquisition program for a commercial it business 
our first acquisition was successfully completed in december when we acquired gec  an oracle services provider 
we developed a tracking and control cots product family os comet that was designed to manage a single geostationery earth orbit geo satellite or several hundred satellites in a constellation 
no company has ever before demonstrated that capability 
our management believes that these financial changes position us for greater revenues and earnings growth in the future 
we have changed the last day of our fiscal year from january to december hence  our fiscal year b was an eleven month period ending on december  liquidity as of december  and december   our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and  respectively 
this decrease is due to our december  acquisition of gec 
current liabilities were increased by approximately  in connection with this acquisition 
our cash portfolio cash and cash equivalents increased  for the fiscal year ended december  this increase was due to cash used in investing activities of  offset by cash provided by operating activities of  and cash provided by financing activities of  by comparison  our cash portfolio decreased  for the eleven months ended december  this decrease was due to cash used in investing activities of  and by operating activities of  offset by cash provided by financing activities of  the cash used in investing activities was due to a  investment in software development  a  investment in our facilities and capital equipment and net cash paid for gec of  the acquisition of gec was booked using the purchase method of accounting resulting in goodwill of  which will be amortized over ten years 
the cash used in investing activities in the eleven months ended december  was attributable to an investment in software development of  and an investment in company facilities and capital equipment of  in our fiscal years ended december   december  and january   we invested   and  in capital assets  respectively 
the expenditure in the eleven months ended december  was due largely to the completion of remodeling and furnishing our facilities as well as the installation of a wide area network serving all of our principal facilities 
the expenditure in the fiscal year ended january  was due primarily to an investment made in computing resources to support the demonstration of our products and capabilities in an integrated control center 
the expenditures in prior fiscal years were made to support programs and for the modernization of office equipment 
in the fiscal year ended january   we decided to lease new computer equipment and furnishings for our facilities 
we continued to lease new items through the fiscal year ended december  capital for equipment purchases is expected to remain stable for the next two fiscal years because of our recent computer acquisition and modernization efforts 
we will continue our policy of leasing resources for office computing needs and furnishings 
during our fiscal years ended december   december  and january   we spent   and  respectively  in capitalized software development costs to develop new products considered essential in maintaining a strong market position in the satellite command and control industry as well as to test the market for enhanced airport security 
cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended december   december   and january  was   and  respectively 
this was comprised of  borrowed against a line of credit to finance operations   borrowed through two capital lease lines with oliver allen corporation  and  borrowed through huntington bank to finance the acquisition of gec  offset by  in principal payments on long term debt 
in addition   was raised through the exercise of stock options and warrants 
for the fiscal years ended december  and and january   our board of directors determined not to pay any shareholder dividends  but instead to use cash for acquisitions  product development and operations 
in our fiscal years ended december   december  and january  principal payments on long term debt amounted to   and  respectively 
on august   we obtained an additional  to our existing line of credit with huntington national bank 
as of december  and december   we had a line of credit with huntington national bank of  and  respectively 
as of december  and  draws against the line of credit were  and  respectively 
all accounts receivable  equipment  furniture  and fixtures of sti are pledged as collateral against amounts borrowed under the line of credit 
our management believes that capital in addition to that available through operations and the available line of credit will be necessary to fund our plans for expansion and growth during our next fiscal year and beyond 
we may seek debt or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that adequate amounts of financing will be obtained

see note to financial statements describing the differences between the us statutory and effective income tax rates 
analysis of operations overview our current contract base provides sufficient backlog to maintain our operations through june  as of december   our funded backlog for commercial and government contracts respectively was  and  we invested in excess of  during the last two years in our software product os comet 
we believe this investment facilitated many of our contract awards 
we are committed to maintain os comet during fiscal year and beyond 
the commercial constellation business has been stationary through the year ended december   as commercial projects worked to finance both the development and the deployment of their satellites 
in the fourth quarter ended december   exigent  through its acquisition of gec  began expanding its range of business activities into the it business and formed esg for this purpose 
this expansion is expected to provide new customer opportunities in both the government as well as the commercial sectors 
we expect demand for software engineers to provide new customer opportunities  but this demand places a premium on efforts to retain our current workforce 
see risk factors highly competitive market for computer services 
as with all companies in our industry  this places additional pressure on our overall payroll costs 
we believe that our benefits package is competitive within our industry and this should help to recruit workers and retain our current workforce 
as our indirect costs funding benefits increase  pressure is placed on our indirect rates 
we believe that maintaining superior benefits is critical while the demand for software engineers remains high 
we are constantly struggling with the need to minimize costs while maintaining superior employee benefits 
comparison of years ended december   december  and january  as of the fiscal year ended december   our sales were  up from sales of  for the eleven month fiscal year ended december  sales were up after adjusting for the fact that the period ended december  consisted of only eleven months 
our sales for the eleven month fiscal year ended december   decreased from sales of  for our fiscal year ended january  the breakdown between government and commercial sales for these periods is as follows year ended eleven months year ended ended government    commercial    these sales reflect a to government to commercial split in our fiscal year ended december   compared to a to split in our fiscal year ended december  and a to split in our fiscal year ended january  government contract revenue increased in our fiscal year ended december  due to our obtaining additional from the nrl and other government entities  while we completed a major commercial sector contract 
our sales in its fiscal year ended december  increased from our sales in the fiscal year ended january  due largely to obtaining a contract with a new government agency as well as sales of os comet 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to  for the fiscal year ended december  from  for the fiscal year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a write down of work performed with respect to the strategic alliance agreement with motorola 
upon complete review of the circumstances  this was determined to be an impaired asset and we wrote down approximately  in addition  a complete review of the fototag asset resulted in an adjustment in the carrying value of the asset of approximately  gross profit as a percentage of sales for our fiscal year ended january  was of sales 
as a result of the aforementioned writeoffs  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our credit agreement at december  huntington bank has waived this event of default 
the following chart shows the gross profit breakdown between government and commercial contracts during the periods indicated year ended eleven months ended year ended government revenue    cost of sales    gross profit    gross profit as of sales year ended eleven months ended year ended commercial revenue    cost of sales    gross profit    gross profit as of sales general and administrative expenses g a for the fiscal year ended december  were  or  higher than expenses of  for the eleven months ended december  after taking the shortened fiscal year into account  our expenses were or  higher than for the eleven months ended december  this increase resulted primarily from staffing a chief technical officer  staffing other positions which had not previously been staffed such as a chief financial office  expenses associated with financial advisory services  and expenses associated with the acquisition of gec  in addition to the increased marketing effort associated with the new products introduced during the fiscal year ended december  
general and administrative expenses for the eleven months ended december  were  or  lower than our expenses of  for the fiscal year ended january  again  taking into consideration the eleven month year  versus a full twelve month year  g a expenses were or  higher than those for the fiscal year ended january  this increase resulted primarily from  in costs associated with a potential acquisition  an increase in rent expense of  and the complete staffing of corporate officers of approximately  we incurred a net loss of  of sales in the fiscal year ended december   which was down significantly from a net income of  in the eleven months ended december  we attribute this loss to a one time charge for two impaired assets equal to approximately  in addition  there was a significant reduction in commercial revenue as development on a major commercial effort was completed in the eleven months ended december  we continued maintenance on the iridium contract  but at a greatly reduced rate from our previous rate 
we also attribute our loss to a reduction in commercial constellation projects as a result of financing and marketing issues 
the net income in the eleven months ended december  decreased significantly from the fiscal year ended january  of  this decrease was due primarily to the reduction in commercial constellation projects 
outlook this section captioned outlook and other parts of this annual report on form k include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
actual results and the occurrence or timing of certain events could differ materially from those projected in any of such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
see other forward looking statements 
diversification and long term growth 
we expect to diversify our business through sales of cots products in both commercial and government markets and expand our information technology offerings in both the commercial as well as the government markets 
our first step in this strategy was the acquisition of gec 
additionally  we currently plan to seek opportunities for long term growth through additional acquisitions  sales of products for commercial applications  and leveraging our existing technologies and products 
product development 
we are developing new products and product offerings  including the next generation of os comet  the active tracking engine ate and the os icc 
we plan to investigate other new product development opportunities as part of its effort to expand its product offerings and market 
year issues some existing computer programs will be unable to recognize dates properly in the year yk and beyond 
during  we conducted an informal study of our products  systems and operations  including products under development  to improve our business functionality  to identify those of our computer hardware  software and process control systems that do not properly recognize dates after december   and those that are linked to third parties systems 
based on this informal study  we recognized that the os comet product required certain modifications to become yk compliant 
those modifications have been made to the software and are available in the current release  version communications with these certain third parties whose computer systems functionality could adversely impact our operation were completed during the third quarter of these communications will facilitate coordination of any necessary yk conversions and will  additionally  permit us to determine the extent to which we may be vulnerable to the failure of third parties to address their own yk issues 
we completed our review of all desktop computing resources during the third quarter of due to the fact that we believe we have secured sufficient resources to address the yk issue  as it relates to our own computer systems and certain third parties whose computer systems functionality could adversely impact us  we do not believe that contingency planning is warranted at this time 
we believe that yk will not have a material and adverse impact on our desktop computing resources 
the costs of our yk compliance efforts are being funded with cash flows from operations 
some of these costs relate solely to the modification of existing systems  while others are for new systems that will improve business functionality 
in total  these costs are not expected to be substantially different from the normal  recurring costs that are incurred for systems development and implementation  in part due to the reallocation of internal resources and the deferral of other projects 
as a result  these costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations or cash flows 
the assessment of our yk compliance costs constitutes our best estimate 
these estimates were based upon numerous assumptions regarding future events  including assumptions as to the continued availability of certain resources  and  in particular  personnel with expertise in this area  and as to the ability of such personnel to locate and either re program or replace  and test  all affected computer hardware  software and process control systems in accordance with our planned schedule 
we cannot therefore guarantee that these estimates will prove accurate  and actual results could differ significantly from those estimated if these assumptions prove inaccurate 
based upon progress to date  however  we believe that it is unlikely that the foregoing factors will cause actual results to differ significantly from those estimated 
as to our systems linked to third parties  we cannot guarantee that such systems are yk compliant and will be compliant within a timely manner 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that our important third party vendors will successfully and timely test  reprogram and or replace  and test  all of their computer hardware  software and process control systems
