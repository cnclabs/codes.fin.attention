factors that could cause or contribute to such material differences include those disclosed in the certain factors section of this report 
overview we were incorporated in colorado as applied films labs  inc on march   with our main offices located in boulder  colorado 
since inception  our business has evolved from applied thin films research and development to the production and sale of thin film coated glass and coating equipment 
during fiscal years and  we relocated our boulder operations to a new headquarters and manufacturing facility in longmont  colorado 
in march  we completed the development of our latest coating platform  the atx in the second half of fiscal  we experienced a shift in revenue with increasing revenues from the equipment side of the business due to the order volume of atx s 
net revenues of coating equipment are recognized primarily on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred and applied to date in relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract 
the lead time for the sale of coating equipment is generally six to nine months 
to date  we have priced our coating equipment in us dollars 
net sales of thin film coating equipment in fiscal years  and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
coating equipment backlog as of july  was million  compared to  as of july  the majority of our net sales to date have been from the sale of thin film coated glass to manufacturers of lcds 
thin film coated glass sales and related costs are recognized when products are shipped 
historically  net sales have varied substantially from quarter to quarter  and we expect such variations to continue 
we are typically able to ship our thin film coated glass within days of receipt of the order and  therefore  do not have a significant long term backlog of thin film coated glass orders 
our ten largest customers for thin film coated glass accounted for  in the aggregate  approximately  and of gross sales in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the principal demand for our thin film coated glass is by lcd manufacturers  most of which are located in asia 
total gross sales to international customers represented approximately  and of our gross sales in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
we sell most of our thin film coated glass to foreign customers in us dollars except for sales to certain japanese customers that are in yen 
gross sales denominated in yen were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  certain customers and suppliers will be converted to us dollars  reducing our exposure to foreign currency translation charges 
in fiscal  the fpd industry experienced very favorable market conditions in both thin film coating equipment and the coated glass markets 
capital equipment spending grew compared to the prior year as fpd manufacturers began investing in fpd production facilities 
pdp and active matrix lcd manufacturing facility growth is increasing at an unprecedented rate 
the thin film coated glass market is also very strong  led by wireless devices such as pda s and cell phones  evidenced by our growth in stn revenues 
in fiscal  the fpd industry experienced adverse market conditions in both the thin film coated glass market and the thin film coating equipment market 
during fiscal  there was a downturn in the asian economy and many fpd manufacturers located in asia delayed capital spending on new coating equipment 
in addition  market prices for thin film coated glass declined approximately during fiscal during the course of this downturn we reduced costs in our us operations and expanded our lower cost operations at our joint venture in china 
recently  the asian economy has improved and worldwide demand for fpds has risen  resulting in increasing demand for coated glass and thin film coating equipment 
china joint venture 
in april  we entered into our stec joint venture with nsg to produce coated glass in suzhou china for resale through our company  nsg  and others 
the joint venture represents a strategic effort to establish manufacturing capacity in the far east and reduce our total manufacturing costs 
upon formation of the joint venture  each partner sold a production coater to the joint venture and moved a portion of its manufacturing capacity to stec 
we have sold one additional production coater to the joint venture to be delivered in the fall of the equipment sold is a venture system that was in operation in our longmont  colorado facility 
we believe sales to the joint venture are on arms length terms 
one half of the anticipated gain on the sale of the venture to the joint venture will be deferred and amortized into income over the remaining estimated useful life of the system 
we recognize of stec s net income as equity earnings in affiliate on our consolidated statement of operations 
we buy coated glass manufactured by the joint venture and resell it to our customers in asia 
the income from these sales will continue to flow through our consolidated statement of operations 
we expect that the lower cost structure from reduced labor  materials and transportation costs will result in higher margins on our sales of glass manufactured by stec 
the joint venture has determined that it will utilize available cash flows for operating purposes and to repay debt 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive dividends from the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
see results of operations income tax benefit provision 
the only cash flow we will receive from the joint venture will be of the royalty on all joint venture sales  payable quarterly 
we expect that the joint venture will not materially affect our revenues  operating income or cash flows from operating activities  but will increase our net income 
results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

this represented a increase from fiscal to fiscal  and a decrease of from fiscal to fiscal thin film coated glass sales increased to million from fiscal to fiscal and dropped from million to million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to strong demand for coated glass for both tn and stn coated glass 
because it is more complex and expensive to produce than tn coated glass  stn coated glass provides us with higher revenues and gross margins for each panel of glass produced 
also  the growth in demand for wireless communication devices fueled our increased production and sale of stn coated glass in fiscal in fiscal  coated glass prices dropped approximately  which had an adverse impact on coated glass sales 
sales of thin film coating equipment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this growth was driven by the sales of the atx during fiscal and shortly after  we sold three atx systems and recognized partial revenue and margin on two of those systems in the second half of fiscal the fpd industry has appropriated capital for growth in production facilities for both the pdp and active matrix lcd markets for which the atx is particularly well suited 
gross profits gross profits were million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit margins were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
gross profits increased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the high concentration in sales levels of thin film coated glass as well as gross profit contribution from thin film coating equipment revenue that began in the second half of fiscal gross profits for fiscal were also positively impacted by the sale of the refurbished coater to the joint venture 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sg a increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the sales commissions from systems sales 
we use commissioned sales representative firms in partnership with our sales team for the thin film equipment portion of our business 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative costs were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
research and development research and development expenses totaled million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
research and development expenditures consisted primarily of salaries  outside contractor expenses and other expenses related to our ongoing product development efforts 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to changes in staffing and material and supplies expense related to advanced development projects in fiscal the advanced development team completed the design  fabrication  process proving and debugging of our latest atx technology in march of this team is currently engaged in several development projects that will allow us to maintain our industry leadership position 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest income expense interest income expense was   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the shift from interest expense in fiscal and prior years to interest income in fiscal  was related to the investment of the proceeds of million secondary offering that was completed in march the increase in long term borrowings in fiscal funded the million up front capital infusion of the stec joint venture in china 
as of fiscal year end  we had no bank debt 
total bank debt was million and million as of fiscal year end and  respectively 
other income expense other income expense was   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal  other income consisted primarily of royalties from the joint venture of  that were partially offset by a small foreign currency loss 
the decrease in other income from to was the absence of foreign currency gains in fiscal that drove the gain in fiscal it is uncertain whether foreign exchange gains or losses will be incurred in the future 
income tax benefit provision the income tax provision was  for fiscal year the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
we recorded a  tax benefit during fiscal year we received a refund of  in fiscal for estimated payments and because we applied the tax loss carryback to previous fiscal years 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was  representing an effective tax rate of a negative 
this benefit was primarily derived from the reversal of the income tax accrual on the equity income from the joint venture that was accrued in fiscal other factors contributing to the relatively low effective tax rate in fiscal were interest and current year equity in earnings in the joint venture income that are not subject to tax 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth summary unaudited quarterly financial information for the last eight fiscal quarters 
in the opinion of management  such information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and reflects all necessary adjustments consisting of only normal  recurring adjustments for a fair presentation of such unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period and there can be no assurance that any trends reflected in such results will continue in the future 
our results of operations may be subject to significant quarterly variations

net sales during fiscal were relatively flat due to reduced demand from customers for thin film coated glass as well as a reduction in capital spending and thin film equipment purchases in the industry 
net sales of thin film coated glass for fiscal totaled million versus million during fiscal year with stn coated glass representing over of fiscal glass sales 
sales and related costs of thin film coated glass products are recognized when products are shipped 
sales of thin film coating equipment totaled million in fiscal versus million in fiscal with revenue recorded on two atx systems in the second half of fiscal approximately of the revenue for coating equipment was recorded in the second half of the year 
we utilize the percentage of completion accounting method for recognizing sales of equipment 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note significant accounting policies equipment sales revenue recognition 
during the year  we sold two atx systems and on july   we announced the sale of a third atx system to a major japanese pdp manufacturer 
this represents a major market penetration for our latest equipment platform 
we have successfully sold the atx system into three different countries in the far east 
in absolute dollars  total gross profits grew for each quarter in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profits were positively impacted beginning in the third quarter of fiscal from margins on the atx system sales 
margins in fourth quarter fiscal were negatively impacted due to the refurbishment program  whereby we took a production coater off line at the beginning of june to be refurbished and sold it to the stec for delivery in first quarter of fiscal this drop in production in longmont negatively affected our margins for the fourth quarter 
once this system is in production at stec  it is anticipated to have a positive impact on equity earnings going forward 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased per quarter during fiscal due to the re introduction of sales commissions for thin film equipment sales  which escalated with equipment revenue in the second half of the year 
included in the fiscal sg a expenses are one time charges totaling  for the completion of the relocation of our facilities to longmont and severance charges 
interest expense decreased sequentially since the third quarter of fiscal year and converted to interest income from the third quarter of fiscal interest income was  in fiscal compared to an expense of  in the prior year 
at the end of third quarter  we raised million in a secondary offering and we have a large portion of these funds invested in low risk securities and instruments 
equity earnings in affiliate have grown substantially since the joint venture commenced production in april  and is now contributing significantly to our profits 
the joint venture has also benefited from increased demand for stn coated glass which allowed stec to shift production to the higher margin stn product 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with cash generated from operations  proceeds from an initial and secondary public offerings of our common stock  and with borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for the corresponding period in fiscal due primarily to net income earned during the year 
in fiscal  we paid off our bank debt under our line of credit from the proceeds of our secondary offering 
as of july   cash and cash equivalents were approximately million and working capital was million 
as of july   accounts receivable were approximately million 
our million credit facility with a commercial bank will expire on september  as of july   we had no outstanding balances on our credit facility 
the interest rate under the credit facility was at july  the credit facility generally restricts our ability to make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  enter into capital leases or guarantee such obligations 
to remain in compliance with the credit agreement  we must also maintain certain financial ratios 
at july  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants in our credit facility 
capital expenditures were  million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  consisting primarily of costs related to the completion of additional coating capacity  additional research and development hardware  thin film coating test equipment and development support equipment 
the majority of capital spending in fiscal was for machinery and equipment to enhance our process capabilities in thin film coated glass and for modifications to our atx demonstration 
we believe that our working capital and capital resource needs for the next months will continue to be met by our current cash and cash equivalents  operations  and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
we believe that success in our industry requires substantial capital in order to maintain flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may arise 
we may  from time to time  invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies and may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
year compliance the year issue did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the systems of other companies that interact with us may not be year compliant  which may adversely affect us 
recent financial accounting standards board statements several new accounting pronouncements have been issued in fiscal and  some of which are listed in the notes to the financial statements that have impacted us in fiscal year and these standards may impact us going forward 
management believes that these accounting standards will not have a material impact on the operating results when implemented 
see item item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices 
we are exposed to market risk through interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal funding and investing activities 
foreign exchange exposure we are exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with our accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in japanese yen 
at july   we had approximately million of accounts receivable and million of accounts payable denominated in yen compared with july   when we had approximately  of accounts receivable and million of accounts payable denominated in yen 
a one percent change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  net impact on pre tax income based on the july  quarter end foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable balances 
our customers typically pay us for our yen denominated sales within approximately to days of the date of sale 
we occasionally offer cash discounts for early payment and pre payment 
notwithstanding the above  actual changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
the potential impact is likely greater the greater the magnitude of the rate change
