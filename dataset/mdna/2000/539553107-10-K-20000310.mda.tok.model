changes in financial condition general local financial s primary asset is the capital stock of the bank

new management has changed the bank s activities significantly 
as described more fully below  management has reduced the level of cmos with interest rate adjustments tied to the cofi  eliminated all swap and hedging contracts and eliminated the bank s portfolio of sub prime  indirect automobile loans 
while these measures reduced the bank s assets by over billion and resulted in substantial losses on the sale and write down of assets  management believes the bank s financial condition is greatly improved and it is better positioned for future growth 
in pursuit of new management s growth strategy  the bank has shifted its activities from those of a traditional savings and loan to those generally associated with a commercial bank 
on may   the bank converted from a savings bank to a national banking association 
the bank has increased its commercial and consumer lending and expects further increases in those areas 
the bank also has targeted increases in non interest income  increases in lending activities rather than investing activities  and increases in direct lending rather than indirect lending 
the bank s business strategy is to provide its customers with a range of banking products and services of a regional bank while retaining the appeal and level of individualized service of a community bank 
management believes that as a result of the company s strong commitment to highly personalized relationship oriented customer service  its varied products  its strategic branch locations and the long standing community presence of its managers  lending officers and branch personnel  it is well positioned to attract new customers and to increase its market share of loans and deposits

see liquidity and capital resources 
securities 
the company views the securities available for sale as a source of asset liquidity 
liquidity is derived from this source by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell these securities at market prices  and by utilizing unpledged securities as collateral for borrowings 
management intends to emphasize lending activities as opposed to investing activities in order to enhance the weighted average yield on its interest earning assets and thus  its results of operations 
future changes in the securities accounts will be determined by  among other things  liquidity guidelines established by the company and applicable regulatory rules  pledging requirements to retain public funds  and by the rate at which the company can grow its loan portfolio through originations

much of this growth occurred early in the year as the newly hired officers moved some of their existing customer relationships to the bank 
residential real estate loans grew from million to million  an increase of million or 
the bank has continued to originate adjustable rate and year fixed rate loans for its own portfolio 
in addition  consumer loans grew from million to million  an increase of million or

approximately million of loans held for sale were sold during and the bank intends to originate and sell even more loans during as part of a program to control exposure to longer term interest rate risk and improve profitability of the more labor intensive lending functions

contractual principal repayments and interest rates 
the following table sets forth scheduled contractual amortization of the company s total loan portfolio at december   as well as the dollar amount of such loans which are scheduled to mature after one year which have fixed or adjustable interest rates 
demand loans  loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity and overdraft loans are reported as due in one year or less 
principal repayments contractually due total at in years ended december  december  thereafter dollars in thousands residential real estate        commercial        consumer        total        of the billion of loan principal repayments contractually due after december   million have fixed rates of interest and million have adjustable rates of interest 
commercial  consumer and total loans are presented net of undistributed loan proceeds 
scheduled contractual principal repayments do not reflect the actual maturities of loans 
the average maturity of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  in the case of conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which generally give the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgages are substantially lower than current mortgage loan rates due to refinancings of adjustable rate and fixed rate loans at lower rates

the bank also grew its loan portfolio through an acquisition amounting to million or

the increase in interest income on loans during the year ended december  was due to the increase in the average balance from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans during both the year ended december  and the six months ended december  comparative periods was due to a decline in the average yield earned on the company s loan portfolio of in the twelve month comparative periods and basis points in the six month comparative periods

to serve as a basis for making this provision each quarter  the company maintains an extensive credit risk monitoring process that considers several factors  including among other things  current economic conditions affecting the company s customers  the payment performance of individual large loans and pools of homogeneous small loans  portfolio seasoning  changes in collateral values  and detailed reviews of specific large loan relationships 
for large loans deemed to be impaired due to an expectation that all contractual payments will probably not be received  impairment is measured by comparing the company s recorded investment in the loan to the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral or the loan s observable market price 
while management endeavors to use the best information available in making its evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations

additional increases in noninterest expense were due to the additional data processing expenses incurred as a result of the company s year readiness efforts  additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and operation of banksouth as well as start up costs associated with the new operations center which became fully functional during the year ended december  the decrease in noninterest expense during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to nonrecurring charges associated with the private placement 
the decrease in noninterest expenses attributable to the private placement was partially offset by increases in compensation and employee benefits during the year ended december  resultant from the company s strategic development of a commercial business lending line of business 
the decrease in noninterest expense during the six months ended december  was primarily due to the absence of the million before applicable tax benefits special assessment which was recognized by the company in september in connection with the recapitalization of the saif 
pursuant to legislation effective september   all saif member institutions were required to pay a one time special assessment equal to basis points for all saif assessable deposits as of march  this legislation resulted in the recapitalization of the saif and  consequently  during the fourth calendar quarter of  the fdic lowered the bank s assessment rates

provision benefit for income taxes 
during the years ended december  and  the six months ended december  and the year ended june   the company recognized million  million  million and million  respectively  of provisions benefits for income taxes 
at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available for state income tax purposes and had million of alternative minimum tax credits available for carryover for federal income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and at december  and  a valuation allowance for all available state net operating loss carryforwards was established as it was determined to be more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
historically  the company has generated income for federal income tax purposes 
based on the current strategy of new management  no valuation allowance for other deferred tax assets has been established as the company believes it is more likely than not that sufficient income for federal income tax purposes will be realized 
the change in ownership of the company did not result in a limitation on the utilization of the net operating losses

liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  savings deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
it is management s policy to maintain greater liquidity than required in order to be in a position to fund loan originations  to meet withdrawals from deposit accounts  to make principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to make investments that take advantage of interest rate spreads 
the company monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by the company and applicable regulatory requirements 
the company s need for liquidity is affected by loan demand  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
the company can minimize the cash required during the times of heavy loan demand by modifying its credit policies or reducing its marketing effort 
liquidity demand caused by net reductions in deposits are usually caused by factors over which the company has limited control 
the company derives its liquidity from both its assets and liabilities 
liquidity is derived from assets by receipt of interest and principal payments and prepayments  by the ability to sell assets at market prices and by utilizing unpledged assets as collateral for borrowings 
liquidity is derived from liabilities by maintaining a variety of funding sources  including deposits  advances from the fhlb of topeka and other short and long term borrowings 
the company s liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of funds management 
liquid assets are generally invested in short term investments such as overnight money funds and short term government agency securities 
if the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  various forms of both short and long term borrowings provide an additional source of funds 
at december   the company had million in borrowing capacity under a collateralized line of credit with the fhlb of topeka  of which million was outstanding as of such date 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit to originate mortgage and non mortgage loans of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature within one year totaled million at december   and the company did not have borrowings that are scheduled to mature within the same period 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments and that  based upon past experience and current pricing policies  it can adjust the rates of certificates of deposit to retain a substantial portion of its maturing certificates and also  to the extent deemed necessary  refinance any maturing borrowings 
during the years ended december  and  the company made interest payments on the senior notes  which were to be initially funded through an interest reserve account established with an independent trustee and subsequently through dividends from the bank 
during the year ended december   the company purchased and retired million of the senior notes which had been issued in connection with the company s recapitalization in this move will reduce future interest costs associated with those notes 
the senior notes have an annual debt service requirement of million 
during the year ending december   the company intends to fund the interest payments scheduled to be made on march  and september  through dividends from the bank 
capital resources 
federally insured institutions such as the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital 
see business regulation and supervision capital requirements in item hereof 
the following table reflects the company s and the bank s actual levels of regulatory capital and applicable regulatory capital requirements at december minimum required actual excess percent amount percent amount percent amount dollars in thousands the company leverage    core capital    total capital    the bank leverage    core capital    total capital    inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in item hereof have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars except with respect to available for sale securities which are carried at market value  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
recent accounting pronouncements set forth below are recent accounting pronouncements which may have a future effect on the company s operations 
these pronouncements should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies which the company has adopted that are set forth in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application not permitted 
management does not anticipate that this statement will have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position or the future results of operations of the company 
year compliance the company established an enterprise wide program to prepare its computer systems and applications for the year date change and utilized both internal and external resources to identify  correct and test the systems for year compliance 
the compliance program also addressed various third party vendors and service providers and included providing for contingency plans in the event that problems related to the year date change arose 
the company completed its reprogramming as of december  and testing efforts were completed as of june  no system failures or disruptions of operations occurred at january  the company will continue to monitor its systems and third party relationships throughout to address unanticipated problems which may include problems associated with dates subsequent to january and to non year compliant third parties and ensure that all processes continue to function properly 
testing and remediation of all of the company s systems and applications incrementally cost approximately  in  excluding costs of company employees involved in year compliance activities 
all costs have been budgeted and were funded by cash flows from operations 
the company does not believe the costs and efforts related to the year compliance project were material to its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match asset and liability balances within maturity categories to limit the company s exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of the chief executive officer  the president  the chief financial officer  the director of retail operations and the investment manager of the company  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the company 
the asset liability management committee meets monthly or as needed to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and sale activity  and maturities and prepayments of loans  investments and borrowings 
the asset liability management committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to overall asset and liability composition and reports to the full board of directors 
one of the primary goals of the company s asset liability management committee is to effectively increase the duration of the company s liabilities and or effectively contract the duration of the company s assets so that the respective durations are matched as closely as possible 
this duration adjustment can be accomplished either internally by restructuring the company s balance sheet  or externally by adjusting the duration of the company s assets and or liabilities through the use of hedging contracts  such as interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
although the company has in the past hedged its interest rate exposure externally through the use of various hedging contracts  the company s current strategy is to hedge internally through the use of core transaction deposit accounts which are not as rate sensitive as other deposit instruments and fhlb advances  together with an emphasis on investing in shorter term or adjustable rate assets which are more responsive to changes in interest rates  such as adjustable rate us government agency mortgage backed securities  short term us government agency securities and commercial and consumer loans 
the foregoing strategies are more fully described below 
a commonly used method for evaluating interest rate risk includes an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
normally  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
due to differences between institutions balance sheets  these variances may affect institutions differently 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table summarizes the anticipated maturities or repricing of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes below 
more than three to more than three years within three twelve one year to to five over five months months three years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans receivable       securities       other interest earning assets   total       interest bearing liabilities deposits money market and now accounts       passbook accounts       certificates of deposit      borrowings fhlb advances    senior notes   total       excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities       cumulative excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities       cumulative excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets adjustable rate loans and securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature and fixed rate loans and securities are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid  based on scheduled amortization  in each case as adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments based on  among other things  historical performance 
balances have been reduced for nonaccrual loans 
does not include unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale 
comprised of cash and due from banks  deposits with other banks and fhlb and frb stock 
adjusted to take into account assumed annual decay rates which were applied against money market  now and passbook accounts 
maturity based on call date rather than actual maturity date 
although interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the asset liability management committee also regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and economic value of equity eve  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and eve that is authorized by the board of directors of the company 
the following tables set forth for the indicated dates the estimated dollar and percentage change in the company s net interest income over a four quarter period and eve based on the indicated changes in interest rates 
december  december  net interest income net interest income next four quarters next four quarters change in basis estimated change estimated change points in from base change from base change interest rates s from base s from base december  december  eve eve change in basis estimated change estimated change points in from base change from base change interest rates s from base s from base assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
the base net interest income is an estimate made by utilizing yields and rates on assets and liabilities in the existing balance sheet as of the dates shown adjusted for assumptions based on  among other things  future loan and deposit changes and estimated loan prepayment speeds 
the difference between december  and december  net interest income in the base case is mainly due to an increase in interest earning assets 
the difference between december  and december  eve in the base case is mainly due to the change from using industry wide deposit decay rates to applying company historical decay rates to deposit accounts resulting in longer durations for these deposits and increasing eve 
the difference in eve in the down shocks at december  versus december  is mainly due to loans and securities increasing in market value to a greater degree at december  due to the slowing of prepayment speeds and resultant longer durations 
the model reflects only the effects of assumptions made by management while running the different interest rate shocks 
the only variables between the different rate shocks are the interest rates and the prepayment speeds 
the prepayment assumptions used in the model are based on historical and market estimates 
standard present value calculation methodology is used to discount the estimated future cash flows of assets and liabilities at appropriate discount rates 
the market value for cofi indexed cmos is obtained through a bloomberg calculator 
management of the company believes that the assumptions used by it to evaluate the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and eve could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the preceding discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements
