s 
food and drug administration fda  agreed to institute the voluntary recall to replace aluminum components in the high pressure chamber of the regulators with brass components

seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarter october through march which  in turn  affected net income
