item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward looking 
these statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed herein and in item of this form k that could cause actual results to differ materially 
results of operations versus for the year ended december   the company reported a net loss for financial statement purposes of approximately million as compared to net income available to common shareholders of approximately million for the year ended december  on a basic per share basis  the financial statement net loss income decreased to per share for from per share for the primary factor resulting in the net loss for the year ended december  was the recognition of million of other than temporary impairment on certain subordinated cmbs 
the impairment is discussed further below 
other factors contributing to the change in earnings from to were an increase in other reorganization costs and other items as more fully discussed below 
interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs increased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during there were no cmbs acquisitions or sales in however  during  the company increased its cmbs portfolio by acquiring subordinated cmbs at purchase prices aggregating approximately million 
the overall increase was partially offset by a reduction in income from subordinated cmbs due to the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs from cbo in connection with cbo and also the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs in connection with cbo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
gaap requires that interest income generated by subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
this has resulted in income that is lower for financial statement purposes than for tax purposes 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the estimated weighted average anticipated yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of december  was approximately 
these returns were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses 
as discussed further below  impairment was recognized as of december  on the subordinated cmbs that are intended to be sold in as part of the cmbs sale under the plan 
this resulted in the cost basis being written down to fair value as of december  as a result of this new basis  these cmbs will have new yields effective the first quarter of in addition  total interest income will decrease after the effective date of the plan as a result of the cmbs sale 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during the year ended interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans increased by approximately million or to approximately million for as compared to million for interest income from originated loans was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization  which resulted in the securitization of million face value of conduit loans in june the increase between and was primarily due to only six months of interest income recognized in  partially reduced by the prepayment of five originated loans in interest expense total interest expense increased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this increase was principally a result of certain financing facilities that were outstanding for the entire year ended december  as compared to a partial year in such financing facilities increased in connection with the acquisition of subordinated cmbs in and the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv during june due to the chapter filing  certain lenders declared defaults or otherwise took action against the company with respect to a number of criimi mae s financing facilities 
see legal proceedings for a discussion of material litigation between the company and various creditors and agreements the company has reached with certain of these creditors 
equity in losses earnings from investments equity in earnings decreased by approximately million during due to a net loss of approximately million as compared to equity in earnings of million in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in revenue and an increase in certain expenses at cmslp 
the decrease in revenue is primarily due to cmslp s loss of certain servicing rights and the assignment of orix as the successor servicer on those pools during the fourth quarter of the increase in expenses includes an  expense for a prepayment penalty shortfall incurred by cmslp and an increase in general and administrative expenses  including a long term incentive program for cmslp  effective in the fourth quarter of  and other payroll costs 
in addition  expenses increased due to a  write off of a remaining investment balance associated with a now dissolved affiliated entity 
the servicing portfolio was approximately billion as of december  as compared to approximately billion as of december  other income other income decreased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in short term interest and other income earned during on the amounts deposited in the loan origination reserve account  due to suspension of the origination loan program in no interest income was earned on the origination reserve account for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million of short term interest income and net carry income for the corresponding period in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in other short term interest income of approximately  in versus net gain on mortgage security dispositions during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million as a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million  of which approximately  was a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
the remaining  was the result of the sale of four unencumbered mortgage securities and the partial sale of a fifth unencumbered mortgage security 
for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
gain on originated loan dispositions during  gains on originated loan dispositions were approximately  which was a result of five prepayments in the originated loan portfolio 
no originated loans were disposed of during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million for as compared to million for the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the closing of regional offices  suspension of certain business activities and the dismissal of employees following the chapter filing in the fourth quarter of losses on warehouse obligations during the year ended december   the company recorded losses of million on it warehouse obligation  primarily due to a decrease in the selling price of the loans in the company s warehouse line with citibank  when the loans were sold in the third quarter of as of december   the unrealized loss recorded on the obligation under the citibank program was million 
the company recorded  in total  a loss of million for this transaction for both gaap and tax purposes 
see tax basis income discussion that follows 
during the year ended december   the company recorded an unrealized loss of million for its loss exposure under the prudential program 
the company calculated the prudential loss based upon the assumption that the company would not exercise its option with prudential 
as of december   the sole loan originated under the prudential program had not yet been sold 
reorganization items impairment on cmbs 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under criimi mae s plan  a portion of the recapitalization financing is expected to result from the cmbs sale 
the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale had a fair value and amortized cost of million and million  respectively  as of december  the company first filed a plan with the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of and during that same quarter criimi mae began marketing for sale the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale 
criimi mae sold a portion of these bonds in february and intends to enter into one or more additional agreements during the first half of to sell the remaining cmbs subject to the cmbs sale  although there can be no assurance such bonds will be sold 
gaap states that when the fair market value of an investment declines below its amortized cost for a significant period of time and the entity no longer has the ability or intent to hold the investment for the period the entity anticipates is required for the value to recover to amortized cost  other than temporary impairment on the investment should be recognized 
this other than temporary impairment is recognized through the income statement as the difference between amortized cost and fair value 
additional accounting guidance states that other than temporary impairment should be recognized in the period the decision to sell any investment is made if the entity does not expect the fair value to recover before the sale date 
as the company decided in the fourth quarter of to sell the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and it did not expect the value of these bonds to significantly recover before the future sale dates  the company has recognized approximately million of other than temporary impairment related to these cmbs through earnings in the fourth quarter of unrealized losses related to the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale were previously recognized through other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
the other than temporary impairment loss on cmbs is a part of the reorganization items on the income statement as the impairment was recognized as part of the reorganization 
other reorganization items 
during and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  in other reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii 
other reorganization items short term interest income  professional fees   write off of debt discounts and deferred costs  employee retention program accrued costs   excise tax accrued   other   total   gain on sale of cmbs in may  criimi mae completed cbo pursuant to which it sold million of investment grade securities created through the resecuritization of approximately billion of its subordinated cmbs 
criimi mae recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of million face amount investment grade securities sold without call provisions  recognizing criimi mae s transfer of control on those securities 
certain of these securities included call provisions to enable criimi mae to repurchase bonds if market conditions warrant  and call bonds when it is no longer cost effective to service them 
the sold investment grade securities treated as a financing  as well as approximately billion face amount of investment grade and non investment grade securities retained by criimi mae  are now required to be reflected on criimi mae s balance sheet at their fair market value 
additionally  due to the sale treatment under fas  all remaining subordinated cmbs and insured mortgage securities are required to be carried at fair market value 
additionally  as part of cbo  in may  cmslp sold trustee servicing rights for million  resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes  and approximately  for financial reporting purposes 
the company completed no additional resecuritizations during loss on reverse repurchase obligation during  the company realized a loss of million due to the impact of financial market volatility on hedge positions 
as part of cmo iv  the company intended to sell certain of the investment grade tranches that were not initially sold to the public the cmo iv bbb bonds 
in anticipation of this sale  the company entered into a transaction to hedge the value of those securities in june this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting purposes because it involved the purchase and sale of a cash instrument and therefore was required to be recorded at market value marked to market 
because treasury rates declined in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million unrealized loss as of september  criimi mae borrowed and then sold a year treasury note in the amount of million to close the position and the loss was realized in the fourth quarter of write off of capitalized loan origination costs since the company no longer had the intention to securitize the remaining loans originated through the citibank and prudential programs in warehouse facilities  the net deferred costs of million associated with the warehoused loans were written off in tax basis income criimi mae earned approximately million in tax basis income available to common shareholders in or per share  compared to approximately million or per share in the primary factor resulting in the decrease in taxable income from to was the approximately million tax basis loss realized on the loans sold in the third quarter of from the warehouse line with citibank 
other factors contributing to the decline in tax basis income were the deduction of reorganization costs and net decreases in earnings from equity investments 
in the second quarter of  as part of cbo  cmslp sold servicing rights for million resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes which was included in equity in earnings in partially offsetting the aforementioned items was an increase in net interest margin due to recognition of a full year of interest income and interest expense in as compared to a partial year in as previously discussed 
the recently issued internal revenue service revenue procedure provides securities and commodities traders with the ability to elect mark to market treatment for by including an election with their timely filed federal tax extension 
the election applies to all future years as well  unless revoked with the consent of the internal revenue service 
on march   the company determined to elect mark to market treatment as a securities trader for and  accordingly  will recognize gains and losses prior to the actual disposition of its securities 
moreover  some if not all of those gains and losses  as well as some if not all gains or losses from actual dispositions of securities  will be treated as ordinary in nature and not capital  as they would be in the absence of the election 
therefore  any net operating losses generated by the company s trading activity will offset the company s taxable income  and reduce any required distributions to shareholders by a like amount 
see business risk factors risks associated with trader election for further discussion 
if the company does have a reit distribution requirement and such distributions would be permitted under the plan  a substantial portion of the company s distributions would be in the form of non cash taxable dividends 
versus interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs increased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during during  the company increased its cmbs portfolio by acquiring subordinated cmbs at purchase prices aggregating approximately million during as compared to the million during this increase was partially offset by a reduction in income from subordinated cmbs due to the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs from cbo in connection with cbo and also the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs in connection with cbo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gaap requires that interest income generated by subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
this currently results in income that is lower for financial statement purposes than for tax purposes 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the estimated weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of december  and  was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in anticipated unleveraged yield is primarily due to five subordinated cmbs acquisitions in with anticipated unleveraged yields between and which reduced the overall average of the cmbs portfolio 
these returns were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and interest expense attributable to the financing of the rated tranches at current interest rates and current borrowing amounts 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million and the sale of four mortgage securities and a portion of a fifth mortgage security for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans of approximately million for was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization 
the cmo iv securitization totaled million face value of conduit loans  a majority of which were no lock 
interest expense interest expense increased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this increase was principally a result of increased borrowings in connection with the acquisition of subordinated cmbs during additionally  criimi mae incurred interest expense in connection with million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued during the fourth quarter of and the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of million face amount of debt de recognized from the financial statements in conjunction with cbo in may and the decrease in the company s weighted average cost of borrowing to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in one month libor  based on the average  for the year as compared to the year due to the chapter filing  certain lenders declared defaults or otherwise taken action against the company with respect to a number of criimi mae s financing facilities 
see legal proceedings for a discussion of material litigation between the company and various creditors and agreements the company has reached with certain of these creditors 
net interest margin net interest margin increased by approximately million or for to approximately million from approximately million for the net interest margin increase was due primarily to the increase in subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  income from originated loans  as previously discussed 
gain on sale of cmbs in may  criimi mae completed cbo pursuant to which it sold million of investment grade securities created through the resecuritization of approximately billion of its subordinated cmbs 
criimi mae recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of million face amount investment grade securities sold without call provisions  recognizing criimi mae s transfer of control on those securities 
the sale of million face amount investment grade securities with significant call provisions was treated as a financing and resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately million 
certain of these securities included call provisions to enable criimi mae to repurchase bonds if market conditions warrant and call bonds when it is no longer cost effective to service them 
the sold investment grade securities treated as a financing  as well as approximately billion face amount of investment grade and non investment grade securities retained by criimi mae  are now required to be reflected on criimi mae s balance sheet at their fair market value 
additionally  due to the sale treatment under fas  all remaining subordinated cmbs and insured mortgage securities are required to be carried at fair market value 
this reclassification resulted in a cumulative net decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million a million decrease from september  
additionally  as part of cbo  cmslp sold trustee servicing rights for million  resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes  and approximately  for financial reporting purposes 
equity in earnings from investments equity in earnings from investments decreased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this decrease included impairment losses on purchased mortgage servicing rights recorded by cmslp since their fair value was less than their amortized cost at december  the general market turmoil commencing in late summer of resulted in the use of higher yields in determining the servicing rights fair value which caused the fair value to be less than the amortized cost 
at september   cmslp was responsible for certain servicing functions on a mortgage loan portfolio of approximately billion 
however  due to criimi mae s chapter filing and its relationship with criimi mae  cmslp arranged for orix  formerly known as banc one mortgage capital markets  llc  to succeed it as master servicer on two commercial mortgage pools during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a loss of approximately million for the recorded value of the rights  of which substantially all of the loss flowed through to criimi mae 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in servicing fee streams and float income earned on escrow balances derived from the remaining servicing portfolio  which grew to approximately billion as of december  as compared to approximately billion as of december  other income other income increased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in short term interest and other income earned during on the amounts deposited in the loan origination reserve account  which had an average balance of approximately million for the year ended december  approximately million of short term interest income and net carry income were earned on these deposits for the year ended december  amounts earned on the origination reserve account for the year ended december  were immaterial 
net gain on mortgage security dispositions during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million  of which approximately  was a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
in addition  criimi mae sold four unencumbered mortgage securities and a portion of a fifth mortgage security  which resulted in a financial statement gain of  during  cri liquidating s disposition of its remaining mortgage assets and its interest in three limited partnership participation agreements resulted in net gains of approximately million before minority interests for financial statement purposes 
these net gains were partially offset by nine prepayments of mortgage assets held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  which resulted in financial statement losses of  for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in general and administrative expenses during these periods was primarily the result of the significant growth of criimi mae s commercial mortgage operations during the first nine months of this increase was partially offset in the fourth quarter due to the closing of regional offices  the suspension of certain business activities and the dismissal of employees involved in suspended activities following the chapter filing 
realized loss on reverse repurchase obligation and unrealized losses on warehouse obligations during  the company recorded realized and unrealized losses aggregating million and million  respectively  primarily due to the impact of financial market volatility on losses on hedge positions and commitments related to commercial mortgage loans in the company s securitization pipeline 
as part of cmo iv  the company intended to sell certain of the security tranches that were not initially sold to the public the cmo iv bbb bonds 
in anticipation of this sale  the company entered into a transaction to hedge the value of those securities 
as a result  criimi mae borrowed and then sold a year treasury note in the amount of million 
the company was informed by citibank that the position was closed on october  this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting purposes because it involved the purchase and sale of a cash instrument and therefore is required to be recorded at market value marked to market 
because treasury rates declined from the date of the transaction to the liquidation of the position  the company recorded a realized loss of approximately million  of which approximately million was recognized as of september  with the remaining  loss recognized in the fourth quarter 
the parties who fund the company s loan originations are required under the relevant agreements to hedge the related loans and to provide timely written hedge position reporting 
as of december   the company s obligation under the citibank program was million based primarily on information provided by citibank in excess of the fair value of the loans and the company s loss exposure under the prudential program was million if the company does not exercise its option 
as a result  criimi mae recorded an aggregate million unrealized loss on its obligations as of december  the unrealized loss of million relating to the citibank program as of december   is based on the estimated fair value of the loans offset by the unpaid principal balance of the loans at december   hedge losses and certain estimated fees and other costs 
depending on market conditions  including interest rate movements  these losses could materially increase or decrease in subsequent reporting periods 
the company has calculated the prudential loss based upon the assumption that the company would not exercise its option with prudential 
write off of capitalized origination costs since the company no longer has the intention to securitize the remaining loans in warehouse that were originated through the citibank and prudential programs  the net deferred costs of million associated with the warehoused loans were written off in reorganization items during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million in reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii 
reorganization item professional fees  write off of debt discounts and deferred costs  employee retention program accrued costs  excise tax  other  total  financial statement net income as a result of the foregoing  net income available to common shareholders for financial statement purposes was approximately million for  a decrease from approximately million for on a per basic share basis  financial statement net income decreased to per basic share for from per basic share in tax basis income criimi mae earned approximately million in tax basis income available to common shareholders in or per share  compared to approximately million or per share in the primary factors resulting in the million increase in tax basis income from to was due to the growth of criimi mae s portfolio of subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  earnings from cmo iv 
also contributing to the increase in tax basis income was a million gain on the sale of the trustee servicing rights associated with cbo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the increases in the foregoing were increases in interest expense  general and administrative expenses  reorganization items and the write off of certain net deferred costs related to the citibank and prudential programs 
although  in absolute dollars  tax basis income increased from to  tax basis income per share decreased due to the increase in the average number of shares outstanding from  in to  in total tax basis income per share for included of non recurring income from the mortgage dispositions of a subsidiary  cri liquidating  which completed its scheduled liquidation in late cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a significant increase in the amount of cash that is restricted due to stipulations entered into in connection with the chapter proceedings or due to agreements that require certain cmbs interest income payments and or cmbs sales proceeds to be held in segregated accounts 
partially offsetting this decrease was an overall increase in net payables in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to the suspension of the company s subordinated cmbs acquisition and origination programs as a result of the chapter filing in october net cash used in financing activities increased in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the suspension of the company s subordinated cmbs acquisition activities  suspension of equity and debt offerings and payment of principal paydowns per the stipulation agreements with secured lenders 
versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin resulting from the company s acquisitions of subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  cmo iv as previously discussed in results of operations 
this increase in net interest margin was partially offset primarily by an increase in net receivables associated with the chapter filing 
net cash used in investing activities increased for as compared to the increase was primarily a result of increased purchases of subordinated cmbs 
also contributing to the increase in cash used in investing activities was the purchase of million of commercial loans in connection with cmo iv 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of proceeds received from the sale of collateral bond obligations in connection with cbo and from mortgage securities disposition proceeds 
net cash provided by financing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to proceeds from debt issuances related to the sale of the collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv  collateralized bond obligations in connection with cbo  and variable rate secured borrowings  net of principal payments  and increased proceeds from equity offerings 
these increases were partially offset by payments made in connection with collateral calls made by lenders primarily in the latter part of the third quarter 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the petition date  criimi mae used proceeds from long term  fixed rate match funded debt refinancings  short term  variable rate secured borrowings  unsecured and other borrowings  securitizations and issuances of common and preferred shares to meet the capital requirements of its business plan 
since the chapter filing  the company has suspended its subordinated cmbs acquisition  origination and securitization operations  but continues to service mortgage loans through cmslp 
prior to the petition date  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s subordinated cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain loan to value ratios 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below the minimum amount required 
in order to refinance a portion of its short term  variable rate secured borrowings with long term  fixed rate debt  the company entered into resecuritization transactions 
in may  criimi mae completed cbo  its second resecuritization of its subordinated cmbs portfolio  which under fas  qualified for both sale and financing accounting 
through cbo  criimi mae refinanced million of its variable rate debt with fixed rate  match funded debt 
the debt is considered match funded because the maturities and principal requirements of the debt closely match those of the related collateral 
the transaction also generated additional borrowing capacity of approximately million  which was used primarily to fund additional subordinated cmbs purchases 
in june  criimi mae securitized million of originated and acquired commercial mortgage loans by selling million face amount of fixed rate investment grade securities 
the tranches not sold to the public were partially financed with variable rate secured financing agreements 
after the above structured finance transactions  the company continued to have a substantial amount of short term  variable rate secured financing facilities which were subject to the previously discussed collateral requirements based on cmbs security values 
as a result of the turmoil in the capital markets commencing in late summer of  the spreads between cmbs yields and the yields on treasury securities with comparable maturities began to increase substantially and rapidly 
criimi mae s short term secured creditors perceived that the value of the subordinated cmbs securing their facilities with the company had fallen  creating a value deficiency as measured by the loan to value ratio and  consequently  made demand upon the company to provide cash or additional collateral with sufficient value to cure the perceived value deficiency 
in august and september of  the company received and met collateral calls from its secured creditors 
at the same time  criimi mae was in negotiations with various third parties in an effort to obtain additional debt and equity financing that would provide the company with additional liquidity 
on friday afternoon  october   the company was in the closing negotiations of a refinancing with one of its unsecured creditors that would have provided the company with additional borrowings  when it received a significant collateral call from merrill lynch 
the basis for this collateral call  in the company s view  was unreasonable 
after giving consideration to  among other things  this collateral call and the company s concern that its failure to satisfy this collateral call would cause the company to be in default under a substantial portion of its financing arrangements  the company reluctantly concluded on sunday  october  that it was in the best interests of creditors  equity holders and other parties in interest to seek chapter protection 
accordingly  the company filed for relief under chapter on monday  october  as of december   criimi mae had secured financing agreements with gacc  lehman ali  inc  first union  merrill lynch  morgan stanley and citicorp 
certain of these lenders have registered the pledged securities in their own names 
as a result  the trustee makes payments on such securities to the registered holder 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  certain registered holders withheld payments related to securities not registered to criimi mae 
the company has negotiated and finalized agreements with five of its lenders 
criimi mae inc s unrestricted cash position has increased from approximately million on october  to approximately million as of december  due to the uncertainty of the effects of the chapter filing on the business of the company  pending litigation  material reorganization items to be incurred during the pendency of the bankruptcy and numerous other factors beyond the company s control  no assurance can be given that the company s cash flow will be sufficient to fund operations for any specified period while the company is in bankruptcy 
under criimi mae s plan  a portion of the recapitalization financing is expected to result from the cmbs sale 
the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale had a fair value and amortized cost of million and million  respectively  as of december  the company first filed a plan with the bankruptcy court in the fourth quarter of and during that same quarter criimi mae began marketing for sale the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale 
criimi mae sold a portion of these bonds in february and intends to enter into one or more additional agreements during the first half of to sell the remaining cmbs subject to the cmbs sale  although there can be no assurance that such bonds will be sold 
as the company decided in the fourth quarter of to sell the cmbs subject to the cmbs sale and it does not expect the value of these bonds to significantly recover before the future sale dates  the company has recognized approximately million of other than temporary impairment related to these cmbs through earnings in the fourth quarter of the value of the company s subordinated cmbs and government insured securities is based upon the combined yield of current treasury rates and the current spread above treasury rates that an investor would require in a purchase transaction 
during the year ended december   the required spreads above treasury rates were substantially unchanged on a total portfolio basis 
however  treasury rates increased significantly from december  which  when combined with the required spreads  resulted in an aggregate million decrease in the value of the company s portfolio of cmbs and fhas and gnmas from december  to december  on march   morgan stanley sold the cbo bbb bonds which have a face amount of million and a coupon of 
the proceeds of million were used to pay off million of the related short term  variable rate debt due morgan stanley and the remaining net proceeds of million were remitted to criimi mae 
criimi mae retained the right to call each cmbs when the outstanding principal balance amortizes to of its original face balance 
the call option prevents criimi mae from surrendering control of the assets pursuant to the requirements of fas and thus the transaction is accounted for as a financing and not a sale 
this resulted in criimi mae recognizing a fixed rate liability for these bonds in the amount of the gross proceeds  which was approximately million 
on april   the company finalized an agreement by which salomon smith barney  in cooperation with criimi mae  agreed to sell the remaining two classes of investment grade cmbs from cmo iv with a face amount of million and an average coupon rate of constituting a portion of the collateral security advances under financing agreements with citicorp 
criimi mae sold these two classes of cmbs in may and october criimi mae retained the right to call each cmbs when the principal balance amortizes to of its original face balance 
the call option prevents criimi mae from surrendering control of the assets pursuant to the requirements of fas and thus the transaction has been accounted for as a financing and not a sale 
gross proceeds from the sale were used to pay off million of secured debt and certain costs  and the remainder of approximately  was remitted to criimi mae 
this resulted in criimi mae recognizing a fixed rate liability for these bonds in the amount of the gross proceeds received 
on august   all but three of the commercial loans originated under the citibank program were sold for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the loans sold had an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million 
on september   the remaining three loans were sold for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the loans sold had an aggregate principal balance of million 
prior to the actual sale of these loans the company had recorded its unrealized losses based on pricing data received from citibank 
in the case of each sale of the commercial loans  the minimum net proceeds provision was waived by agreement of the company  the unsecured creditors committee and the equity committee 
for gaap purposes  the company realized million in losses from the third quarter of through the third quarter of the company s ability to resume the acquisition of subordinated cmbs  as well as its loan origination and securitization programs  depends first on its ability to obtain the requisite recapitalization proceeds  obtain confirmation and approval of a plan reorganization and emerge from bankruptcy as a successfully reorganized company  and second  on its ability to access additional capital once it has successfully emerged from bankruptcy 
factors which could affect the company s ability to access additional capital include  among other things  the cost and availability of such capital  changes in interest rates and interest rate spreads  changes in the commercial mortgage industry and the commercial real estate market  general economic conditions  perceptions in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants under the company s debt securities and credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial condition  and business prospects 
the company can give no assurance as to whether it will be able to obtain additional capital or the terms of any such capital

the election applies to all future years as well  unless revoked with the consent of the internal revenue service 
on march   the company determined to elect mark to market treatment as a securities trader for and  accordingly  will recognize gains and losses prior to the actual disposition of its securities 
moreover  some if not all of those gains and losses  as well as some if not all gains or losses from actual dispositions of securities  will be treated as ordinary in nature and not capital  as they would be in the absence of the election 
therefore  any net operating losses generated by the company s trading activity will offset the company s taxable income  and reduce any required distributions to shareholders by a like amount

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market as well as the libor market 
the company will have an increase in the amount of interest expense paid on its variable rate obligations primarily due to increases in one month libor 
the company will also experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to changes in the interest rates of us treasury bonds as well as increases in the spread between us treasury bonds and cmbs 
criimi mae has entered into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the amount of interest expense payable under its variable rate borrowings 
the caps provide protection to criimi mae to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index typically one month libor  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  criimi mae will receive payments based on the difference between the index and the cap 
the term of the cap as well as the stated interest rate of the cap  which in all cases is currently above the current rate of the index  will limit the amount of protection that the caps offer 
prior to the petition date  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain collateral at all times with a market value not less than a specified percentage of the outstanding indebtedness 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below this threshold amount 
these financing arrangements were used by criimi mae to provide financing during the period of time from the acquisition or creation of the subordinated cmbs to the date when criimi mae would resecuritize the portfolio in order to match fund a significant portion of the portfolio with fixed rate debt  thereby eliminating interest rate risk on that portion of the cmbs 
these transactions also increased the borrowing capacity of the company which was used to acquire subordinated cmbs
