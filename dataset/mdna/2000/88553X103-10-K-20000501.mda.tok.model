item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
dfx s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of some factors including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview general dfx was founded in august to design  develop  market and support d graphics chips  graphics boards and api software for the interactive electronic entertainment market 
dfx derives revenue from the sale of d and d d graphics chips and graphics boards designed primarily for use in pcs 
dfx began commercial shipments of its first d graphics product  the voodoo graphics chipset  in september and introduced subsequent graphics chipsets in fiscal and fiscal in march  dfx began shipment of its voodoo product family of enhanced and more fully featured  single chip d d media processors 
dfx s voodoo product family was broadened in fiscal to include board level products 
dfx s sales have historically been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
revenues derived from sales to ingram micro accounted for approximately of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  revenues derived from sales by dfx to stb prior to the may  effective date of the dfx stb merger accounted for of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the announcement and consummation of the merger between dfx and stb caused some of dfx s customers to end or curtail their relationships with the combined company 
for example  two of dfx s largest customers in fiscal  creative technology ltd 
and diamond multimedia systems  inc  competed directly with stb 
these customers and their subsidiaries together accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of dfx s total revenue in fiscal sales to diamond and creative technology following the announcement of the merger decreased significantly from prior levels and these customers are no longer customers of the combined company 
to date  the loss of business from dfx s historical customer base has not been fully replaced through the sale of the combined company s board level products  which has negatively impacted dfx s revenues 
if other customers of dfx terminate their relationship with the combined company or sales of the combined company s graphics boards continue to be less than the sales generated with dfx s historical customer base  dfx s business could be materially harmed 
as part of its manufacturing strategy  dfx leverages the expertise of third party suppliers in the areas of wafer fabrication  assembly  quality control and assurance  reliability and testing 
this strategy allows dfx to devote its resources to research and development and sales and marketing activities while avoiding the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating a wafer fabrication facility and related operations 
dfx does not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for its products and does not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
all of dfx s wafers are currently manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc in taiwan 
dfx obtains manufacturing services from tsmc on a purchase order basis 
dfx provides tsmc with a rolling six month forecast of its supply needs and tsmc builds to dfx s orders 
dfx purchases wafers and die from tsmc 
once production yield for a particular product stabilizes  dfx pays an agreed price for wafers meeting some acceptance criteria pursuant to a good die only pricing structure for that particular product 
until production yield for a particular product stabilizes  however  dfx must pay an agreed price for wafers regardless of yield 
such wafer and die purchases constitute a substantial portion of cost of products revenues once products are sold 
tsmc is responsible for procurement of raw materials used in the production of dfx s products 
dfx believes that raw materials required are readily available 
dfx s products are packaged by three third party subcontractors  advanced semiconductor engineering group ase  caesar technology  inc and siliconware 
all of dfx s products are tested by ase 
this assembly and testing is conducted on a purchase order basis rather than under a long term agreement 
all purchases of wafers and assembly and test services are denominated in us dollars 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees since inception august through the effective date of dfx s ipo  dfx recorded aggregate deferred compensation of approximately million  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price at the date of grant 
this amount is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options 
this amortization resulted in charges to operations of  of which  and  were recorded in research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively in each of the years ended january   december  and  and will result in charges over the next two quarters of approximately  of which  and  will be recorded in research and development expenses and selling  general  and administration expenses  respectively 
overview of stb merger and treatment of ipr d dfx completed the stb merger in may as a result of the merger  stb is now a wholly owned subsidiary of dfx 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price of million included million of stock issued at fair value fair value being determined as the average price of the dfx stock for a period three days before and after the announcement of the merger  million in stb stock option costs being determined under both the black sholes formula and in accordance with the merger agreement and million in estimated expenses of the transaction 
the purchase price was allocated as follows million to the estimated fair value of stb net tangible assets purchased as of may   million to establish deferred tax liabilities associated with the certain intangibles acquired  million to purchased in process research and development  million to purchased existing technology  million to trademarks  million to workforce in place  million to executive covenants and million to goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price to intangibles was based upon an independent  third party appraisal and management s estimates 
the intangible assets and goodwill acquired have estimated useful lives and estimated first year amortization  as follows estimated fiscal amount useful life amortization purchased existing technology year life  years  year life  years  trademarks  years  workforce in place  years  executive covenants  years  goodwill  years  the value assigned to purchased in process research and development ipr d was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established 
these include projects for voodoo as well as other specialized technologies totaling million 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value as defined below 
net cash flows 
the net cash flows from the identified projects are based on dfx s estimates of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  royalty costs and income taxes from those projects 
these estimates are based on the assumptions mentioned below 
the research and development costs included in the model reflect costs to sustain projects  but exclude costs to bring in process projects to technological feasibility 
the estimated revenues are based on management projections of each in process project and the business projections were compared and found to be in line with industry analysts forecasts of growth in substantially all of the relevant markets 
estimated total revenues from the ipr d product areas are expected to peak in the year ending december  and decline from into as other new products are expected to become available 
these projections are based on our estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new project introductions by our competitors and us 
gross margins 
projected gross margins associated with the identified projects approximate stb s recent historical performance and are in line with comparable industry margins 
the estimated selling  general and administrative costs are consistent with stb s historical cost structure  which is in line with industry averages at approximately of revenues 
research and development costs are consistent with stb s historical cost structure 
royalty rate 
dfx applied a royalty charge of of operating income for each in process project to attribute value for dependency on predecessor core technologies 
discount rate 
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value is based on the industry weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the industry wacc is approximately 
the discount rate used in discounting the net cash flows from ipr d is  a basis point increase from the industry wacc 
this discount rate is higher than the industry wacc due to inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances which could potentially impact the estimates described above 
percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined using costs incurred to date on each project as compared to the remaining research and development to be completed to bring each project technological feasibility 
the percentage of completion varied by individual project ranging from to 
if the projects discussed above are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth some statement of operations data of dfx expressed as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  january  revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development restructuring expense goodwill and intangibles amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net provision for income taxes net income loss years ended january  fiscal and december  fiscal revenues 
revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
dfx s total revenues were for the fiscal year ended january  and million for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal revenues includes revenues of million generated from sales of board level products incorporating voodoo technology by stb following the may   effective date of the merger 
revenues in fiscal were principally attributable to sales of dfx s voodoo and voodoo banshee products 
substantially all of the revenues in fiscal were derived from sale of dfx s voodoo banshee chip and its voodoo and voodoo graphics chipsets 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of total revenues less cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of components and the procurement of semiconductors from dfx s contract manufacturers  labor and overhead associated with procurement  assembly  testing  packaging  warehousing and shipping  and warranty costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was and for the fiscal years ended january  and december   respectively 
the decrease can be primarily attributed to the gross profit generated from the sales of board level products  which have lower margins as compared with the margins on chip only products 
in addition  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues resulted from lower margins associated with the voodoo and voodoo banshee products sold in fiscal  as compared with the margins of voodoo and voodoo graphics products sold in fiscal dfx s future gross profits will be affected by the overall level of sales  the mix of products sold in a period  manufacturing yields  
the impact of price protection credits granted to dfx s customers 
and dfx s ability to reduce product procurement costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel  occupancy costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of capital equipment used in product development and engineering costs paid to dfx s foundries in connection with manufacturing start up of new products 
research and development expenses increased from million in the fiscal year ended december  to million in the fiscal year ended january  included in the fiscal amount is million in research and development expenses attributable to the operations of stb following the may  effective date of the merger 
excluding the impact of expenses related to stb s operations  research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the year ended december  this increase reflects an increase in personnel costs  common cost allocations and engineering costs resulting from the development of voodoo and other future products 
dfx expects to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although these expenses as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for sales  marketing  finance and administration personnel  commissions paid to independent sales representatives  tradeshow  advertising and other promotional expenses and facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal year ended december  to million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of million in expenses relating to the operations of stb following the may   effective date of the merger 
excluding the impact of expenses related to stb s operations  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal this decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily a result of a reduction in selling expenses due to dfx s elimination of the costs of many independent sales representatives  which were supplanted by the combined dfx direct sales force  partially offset by increases in dfx s bad debt expense 
dfx expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate 
in process research and development 
dfx also recorded a one time write off for in process research and development in connection with the stb merger of million in the fiscal year ended january  restructuring expense 
during the fiscal year ended january   dfx incurred restructuring expenses totaling approximately million 
approximately million of this amount related to downsizing the expense levels of dfx given dfx s current financial losses 
in august  dfx recorded a restructuring charge of million  representing a one time reduction in workforce related to the merger with stb 
goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
in connection with the stb merger  dfx recorded assets representing goodwill of approximately million and intangibles of approximately million 
these amounts will be amortized ratably over the amortization periods of the applicable assets 
for the fiscal year ended january   dfx recorded million in related amortization 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net decreased from million in the fiscal year ended december  to million in the fiscal year ended january  the decrease is primarily related to a one time recognition of income in fiscal as a result of the sega litigation settlement  as well as decreased earnings from lower invested cash balances 
in addition  in fiscal dfx incurred interest expense on its revolving credit facility and its outstanding equipment line of credit and capital lease balances 
provision benefit for income taxes 
dfx recorded an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended january   an effective tax rate of 
as a result of the impact of non deductible expenses including intangible amortization and in process research and development  dfx s effective tax rate in fiscal differed from the statutory rate 
dfx recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended december   an effective tax rate of 
dfx s effective tax rate in fiscal differs from the federal statutory rate due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
events which may cause changes in dfx s tax carryovers include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than over a three year period 
the completion of dfx s initial public offering in june resulted in an annual limitation of dfx s ability to utilize net operating losses incurred prior to that date 
the annual limitation is approximately million 
management regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets recorded based upon the weight of available evidence  including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that dfx will not realize a portion of its deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a valuation allowance of  has been established for such amounts at january  one month period ended january  as a result of dfx s change in fiscal year to january from december commencing on february   dfx has reported separately the one month period ended january  during this period  revenues for dfx were million and were principally attributable to the sales of dfx s voodoo banshee and voodoo chipsets 
costs of revenues were million with gross profit as a percent of revenues equal to approximately 
this is below the previous year s gross profit percentage due primarily to dfx s merger with stb announced in december this contributed to lost revenues from former customers and price reductions to existing customers as dfx announced its intention to enter the graphics board business and compete with its existing customer base 
research and development expenditures were million for the period and sales  general  and administrative expenses were million for the period 
interest and other income was million  derived primarily from dfx s cash balances 
there was a tax benefit in the period ended january  in the amount of million 
this benefit equates to a tax rate of and is consistent with dfx s recent tax rate percentages 
years ended december  fiscal and december  fiscal revenues 
revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
revenues in fiscal were principally attributable to sales of dfx s voodoo  voodoo banshee and voodoo graphics chipsets 
revenues in fiscal and fiscal were principally attributable to sales of dfx s voodoo graphics and voodoo rush chipsets 
in both years  revenue growth was a result of increased customer demand for and market acceptance of these products 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of total revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of components  the procurement of semiconductors and printed circuit board assemblies from dfx s contract manufacturers  labor and overhead associated with such procurement and warehousing  shipping and warranty costs 
cost of revenues does not include expenses related to development contract revenues 
cost of revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  due to a change in product mix 
dfx s future gross profit will be affected by the overall level of sales  the mix of products sold in a period  manufacturing yields  and dfx s ability to reduce product procurement costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel  occupancy costs of research and development facilities  depreciation of capital equipment used in product development and engineering costs paid to dfx s foundries in connection with manufacturing start up of new products 
in addition  costs associated with development contracts are included in research and development during fiscal there was no such cost in fiscal research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase reflects an increase in non recurring engineering costs and engineering personnel costs resulting from the commencement of manufacturing of prototypes of the voodoo banshee chip and voodoo chipset 
dfx expects to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipates that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for sales  marketing  finance and administration personnel  commissions paid to independent sales representatives  tradeshow  advertising and other promotional expenses and facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase resulted from the addition of personnel in sales  marketing  finance and administration as dfx expanded operations  increased commission expenses associated with the commencement of commercial sales and increased involvement in tradeshow and advertising activities 
dfx expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues will fluctuate 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to a one time recognition of income as a result of the settlement of litigation on september  relating to the sega s termination of the technology license and development agreement the sega agreement with dfx in july the increase also reflects earnings from higher cash balances resulting from the completion of dfx s initial public offering in june and a public offering in march  partially offset by interest expense on the outstanding equipment line of credit and capital lease balances 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in fiscal dfx recorded no provision for income taxes in fiscal as it incurred losses during such period 
at december   dfx had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire beginning in and  respectively 
under the tax reform act of  the amount of and the benefit from net operating losses that can be carried forward may be impaired in some circumstances 
events which may cause changes in dfx s tax carryovers include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than over a three year period 
the completion of dfx s initial public offering in june resulted in an annual limitation of dfx s ability to utilize net operating losses incurred prior to that date 
the annual limitation is approximately million 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each quarter during the fiscal years ended january  and december  this unaudited information has been prepared by dfx on a basis consistent with dfx s audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the unaudited quarterly information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in light of dfx s limited operating history  dfx believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
three months ended january  october  july  april  december  september  june  march  in thousands revenues         cost of sales         gross profit         operating expenses research and development         selling  general and administrative         in process research and development  restructuring expense   goodwill and intangibles amortization    total operating expenses         income loss from operations         interest and other income expense  net    provision for income taxes       net income loss         basic net income loss per share diluted net income loss per share revenues over the last eight quarters were derived primarily from the sale of the voodoo graphics  voodoo  and voodoo banshee and voodoo chipsets 
in the third quarter of  dfx experienced a significant reduction in demand as compared to the two previous quarters  for its voodoo chipset  primarily from one customer  as well as a greater than expected seasonal slowdown  which resulted in a decrease in revenues from the previous quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  significant increases in demand for dfx s new voodoo banshee product  combined with a stable demand as compared to the third quarter of for its voodoo chipset  resulted in significant revenue growth in the fourth quarter of as compared to the previous quarter 
the first quarter of fiscal was less the previous quarter  as a result of decreased demand for the voodoo and voodoo banshee products 
quarters two  three and four of fiscal  reflect significantly higher revenue numbers as a result of the introduction of the voodoo chipset and the stb systems merger 
cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal year was less in total dollars as compared to the previous quarter as a result of lower revenues 
however  cost of sales remained consistent with previous quarters as a percentage of revenues 
cost of sales for quarters two  three and four of fiscal are up significantly due to increased revenues as a result of the merger 
substantially all of the sales and cost of sales for these quarters is comprised of d graphics cards  as compared to chipsets in previous quarters 
cost of sales as a percentage of total sales also increased significantly  as the margin on board level sales is traditionally less than chipset sales 
cost of sales in increased in the first  second and fourth quarters as a result of increased sales in each of these quarters 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  costs of sales increased due to the product revenue mix during the quarter which carried lower gross margins than historically experienced 
in the third quarter of  cost of sales decreased when compared to the previous quarter primarily due to lower revenues  partially offset by increased costs associated with the initial shipments of dfx s voodoo banshee product  additional overhead costs with respect to lower revenues as a result of a greater than expected seasonal slowdown in the retail channel  and to an increase in inventory reserves due to an exceptionally rapid rate of product lifecycle obsolescence 
research and development expenses increased quarter to quarter in fiscal and in  except for the fourth quarter of the increase in research and development expenses in each quarter through september and the first quarter of fiscal reflects an increase in headcount  non recurring engineering costs resulting from the commencement of manufacturing of the voodoo chipsets and the voodoo banshee and voodoo chips 
in the fourth quarter of  research and development expenses decreased slightly from the previous quarter primarily due to a reduction in non recurring engineering costs 
the significant increase in quarters two  three and four are primarily result of the stb merger  as well as increased headcount and charges associated with the voodoo and vsa family and other future products 
selling  general and administrative expenses fluctuated quarter to quarter throughout and through the first quarter of fiscal these fluctuations are primarily a result of increased finance and administrative staffing and related costs necessary to support higher levels of operations  commission expenses associated with levels of revenues and varying levels of involvement in tradeshow and advertising activities 
the significant increase in cost for the remaining quarters of fiscal is a result of the stb merger as well as advertising and other cost associated with the retail channel business 
interest and other income expense  net fluctuated quarter to quarter in  however remained fairly consistent  declining slightly quarter to quarter in fiscal the increase in interest and other income in the three months ended september  is primarily related to a one time recognition of income as a result of the recent sega litigation settlement  as well as to increased earnings from higher cash balances resulting from the completion of dfx s initial public offering in june  and a public secondary offering in march  partially offset by interest expense on the outstanding equipment line of credit and capital lease balances 
interest and other income expense  net for the fiscal quarters consist primarily of interest income on short term investments  partially offset by interest expense on the revolving credit facility and interest expense on outstanding equipment leases 
dfx believes that  even if it does achieve significant sales of its products  quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues  gross profit and income from operations 
accordingly  dfx believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
in some future quarters  dfx s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of dfx s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   dfx had working capital of million including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
net cash used in operating activities in the fiscal year ended january  was due primarily to a net loss of million  and increases of million in other assets  decreases in accrued expenses of million  partially offset by adjustments of depreciation of million and amortization of million  and the in process research and development write off of million  as well as decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was due primarily to net income of million  and increases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases of million in inventory due to the increase in manufacturing to meet customer demand and million in accounts receivable associated with the generation of revenues 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was due primarily to the net loss of million  and a million increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million in the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   respectively  and was due in each period to the purchase of investments and to the purchase of property and equipment 
in addition  million was used in the merger of stb  offset by cash acquired as a result of the merger of million in fiscal year  dfx does not have any significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under leases 
dfx expects capital expenditures to increase over the next several years as it expands facilities and acquires equipment to support the planned expansion of its operations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was million due to the net proceeds on the drawdown from its line of credit  partially offset by the net repurchase of common stock of million and payments on its capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in the fiscal year ended december  and approximately million in the fiscal year ended december   due primarily to proceeds from the public offering in march and the initial public offering in june dfx has a million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility  as well as a million term loan term loan 
at january   million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under the term loan 
principal amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus basis points at january  
amounts outstanding under the term loan bear interest at libor plus basis points and are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest at january  
payment of principal and interest began november  formulas based on eligible accounts receivable determine availability under the revolving credit facility 
dfx has pledged million of cash and short term term investments  as well of dfx s owned assets as collateral to secure the revolving credit facility 
all indebtedness under the revolving credit facility matures on december   and indebtedness under the term loan matures on november  subject to renewal of the revolving credit facility through such date 
dfx is obligated under a five year agreement to lease a facility in richardson  texas which was previously the corporate headquarters of stb systems 
construction of the  square foot facility was completed in december the total cost of the land and building was approximately million 
dfx made lease payments of approximately  per month in fiscal  although the lease agreement provides that the amount of the lease payments is subject to adjustment based upon prevailing interest rates 
consequently  an increase in prevailing interest rates will increase the expense of the facility 
dfx previously entered into an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the interest rate on a majority of the lease obligation at 
dfx does not currently use a portion of the facility and has subleased a portion of the unused space  constituting approximately forty percent of the facility space  to third parties under long term leases expiring in approximately five years 
at the end of the initial five year lease term  dfx has the option to renew the lease for an additional five years  pay off the underlying debt or cause the building to be sold 
in the event of a sale  the proceeds are to be used to retire the underlying debt 
any excess will be paid to dfx 
any remaining unpaid balance owing on the underlying obligation after the sale of the facility will be the responsibility of dfx 
dfx has invested in capital equipment through equipment leases for its manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico 
dfx s aggregate obligations under all such equipment lease financing arrangements totaled approximately million at january  dfx s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of the expansion of research and product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which dfx s existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and other factors 
dfx believes that its current cash balances and cash generated from operations and from available or future debt financing will be sufficient to meet dfx s operating and capital requirements through at least the end of the current fiscal year 
however  there can be no assurance that dfx will not require additional financing within this time frame 
dfx s forecast of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the factors described earlier in this paragraph will impact dfx s future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds 
dfx may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to dfx  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and additional debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require dfx to relinquish its rights to some of its technologies or products 
the failure of dfx to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on dfx s business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of adoption of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging securities 
currently  as dfx has no derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
would have no impact on dfx s financial condition or results of operations 
to the extent dfx begins to enter into such transactions in the future  dfx will adopt the statement s disclosure requirements in the quarterly and annual financial statements for the year ending january  in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  which clarifies the sec s views on revenue recognition 
dfx believes its existing revenue recognition policies and procedures are in compliance with sab and therefore  sab s adoption will have no material impact on dfx s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
dfx s actual results and the timing of certain events could differ greatly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of known and unknown factors  including the risks faced by dfx described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing dfx 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by dfx or that dfx does not currently believe are important may also harm dfx s business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  dfx s business  financial conditions or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
the following factors and other information in this report should be considered carefully in evaluating dfx and an investment in dfx s common stock 
dfx s proposed merger with gigapixel poses a number of significant risks to dfx s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the proposed merger of gigapixel with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of dfx  which will result in gigapixel becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of dfx  involves some specific risks  including the following dfx and gigapixel may encounter substantial difficulties and costs integrating the two companies products  technologies  research and development activities  administration  sales and marketing and other aspects of operations in a timely manner 
the difficulties  costs and delays involved in this integration may increase operating costs  cause lower than anticipated financial performance or lead to the loss of customers and employees 
the failure to successfully integrate dfx and gigapixel in a timely manner could result in a failure of the combined company to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger and could materially harm the business of the combined company 
uncertainty in the marketplace or customer concern regarding the impact of the merger on the combined company s results of operations could result in customers or potential customers of dfx or gigapixel deferring purchasing or licensing decisions until they have had an opportunity to assess that impact  or ceasing to do business with dfx and gigapixel altogether  which could harm the business of the combined company 
because some gigapixel customers and licensees compete with dfx  these customers and licensees may cease to do business  or may reduce the amount of business that they do  with gigapixel or the combined company  either of which could cause a decline in the combined company s revenues 
the merger will dramatically increase the number of freely tradeable dfx shares and will result in a substantial dilution to current dfx shareholders  which could drive down the price of dfx common stock upon the issuance of shares of dfx common stock in connection with the merger  gigapixel shareholders will hold approximately of the then outstanding number of shares of common stock of dfx  based on the number of shares of dfx common stock outstanding on march  subject to certain contractual restrictions  all of the shares of dfx common stock issued in the merger will be freely tradable in the public market 
sales in the public market of a substantial number of these shares following completion of the merger could adversely affect the market price of dfx common stock 
gigapixel has reported net losses in most recent historical periods and if these losses continue they would adversely affect dfx s financial performance and condition 
gigapixel has incurred net losses for both of the years ended december  and december  if the combined company is not successful in reversing the performance of gigapixel s business operations  those business operations would have a negative impact on the overall business of the combined company 
this negative impact may adversely affect the market price for dfx common stock in the future 
because of the purchase accounting treatment of the merger  non cash charges associated with the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles will reduce dfx s earnings in the future  which could adversely affect dfx s stock price 
the combined company s success following the merger will depend on the retention and integration of key personnel 
there will be substantial expenses resulting from the gigapixel merger 
the closing of the merger is subject to certain conditions that might not be satisfied in a timely manner  which could prevent the merger from being consummated 
in addition  in the event of the consummation of the merger with gigapixel  there are a number of risks related to the business and operations of gigapixel that would affect the operations of the combined company  including a number of the same or similar risks faced by dfx identified below  as well as a number of risks specific to gigapixel  including gigapixel s limited operating history  its dependence on a limited number of customers  gigapixel s inability to control or influence its licensees manufacturing  promotion  distribution or pricing of products incorporating its d core technologies and its limited experience in the set top box  game console and portable device markets 
in the event that the merger is not consummated  dfx will face other risks  including the opportunity costs associated with the pursuit of a business combination with gigapixel 
dfx s quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which may increase the volatility of the price of dfx s common stock 
dfx s quarterly and annual results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future 
these variations are the result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond dfx s control 
these factors include the ability to successfully develop  introduce and market new or enhanced products the ability to introduce and market products in accordance with customer design requirements and design cycles changes in the relative volume of sales of various products with different margins changes in demand for dfx s products and its customers products gains or losses of significant customers or strategic relationships the volume and timing of customer orders the availability  pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for dfx s products the timing of new product announcements or introductions by competitors product obsolescence and the management of product transitions production delays decreases in the average selling prices of products any one or more of the factors listed above or other factors could cause dfx to fail to achieve its revenue and profitability expectations 
most of dfx s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
dfx may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could materially harm quarterly operating results 
as a result of the above factors  dfx believes that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance 
the results of any one quarter are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
dfx is growing rapidly and may not have the resources to manage effectively additional growth 
the recent growth and potential future growth of dfx has placed significant demands on its management as well as on its technical  administrative  operational and financial resources 
as a result  dfx may not have sufficient resources to sustain and effectively manage any additional growth 
the expansion of dfx s business to take advantage of new market opportunities will require significant technical resources  management attention and financial resources 
to manage additional growth dfx may be required to expand its engineering  sales  marketing and customer support organizations attract and retain additional qualified personnel expand its physical facilities invest in the development or enhancement of its current products and develop new technologies and products that meet changing industry needs develop systems  procedures or controls to support the expansion of its operations an inability on the part of dfx to sustain or manage any additional growth could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of dfx 
dfx will depend on its ability to effectively develop new technologies and products to meet the changing industry standards  practices and customer needs associated with the rapidly changing and intensely competitive pc and graphics chip and board industries 
dfx will depend  in part  on its ability to develop leading technologies  enhance its existing services and develop and introduce new technologies and products to meet the needs of dfx s customers 
dfx also must continue to meet the demands of technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
although dfx will strive to be a technological leader  future technology advances may not complement or be compatible with its products 
in addition  dfx may be unable to economically and timely incorporate technology changes and technology advances into its business 
dfx may be unsuccessful in effectively using new technologies  adapting its services to emerging industry standards or developing  introducing and marketing product enhancements or new products 
dfx may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products 
the inability of dfx to develop and introduce new technologies or products or to enhance existing products or services on a timely and cost effective basis  or the failure of new technologies or products to achieve market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
dfx s operations depend on the experience of key personnel and its ability to retain  attract  and integrate its key personnel 
dfx s business operations depend on the continued services of its executive officers and other key personnel 
dfx may be unable to retain its key personnel or to attract other qualified personnel 
the future operations of dfx depend upon its ability to retain  attract and integrate key management personnel 
in addition  competition for highly skilled technical personnel is intense in the industries in which dfx operates 
dfx s shareholders cannot be assured that dfx will be able to successfully identify  attract  hire and retain highly skilled technical personnel in a timely and effective manner 
moreover  competitors may intensify their efforts to recruit highly skilled technical personnel currently employed by dfx as a result of its proposed merger with gigapixel 
the loss of services of one or more highly skilled technical personnel  the failure to attract and retain other highly skilled technical personnel or to recruit new highly skilled technical personnel could disrupt operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale of dfx 
as nearly all of the revenues of dfx will be derived from the pc and graphics boards and chips industries  a downturn in any one of these industries would likely adversely affect dfx s business 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and january    and of dfx s revenues were derived from graphics chips and graphics boards sold for use in pcs 
dfx expects to continue to derive its revenues primarily from the sale of products for use in pcs and the sale of graphics boards and graphics chips 
the pc and graphics chip and board industries are cyclical and have been characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  cyclical market patterns  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles  significant price competition and price erosion  fluctuating inventory levels  alternating periods of over capacity and capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the pc and graphics chip and board markets have also grown substantially in recent years 
however  such growth may not continue 
a decline in pc or semiconductor sales or in the growth rate of such sales would likely reduce demand for dfx s products 
moreover  such changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted product transitions 
in such cases  the manufacturers may abruptly stop purchasing additional inventory from suppliers such as dfx until the excess inventory has been used 
such suspension of purchases or any reduction in the demand for pcs generally  or for particular products that incorporate dfx s products  would materially harm dfx s business 
in addition  the pc and graphics chip and board industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the past  characterized by lower product demand and accelerated reduction of product prices 
dfx may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in its results of operations due to general conditions in the semiconductor industry 
because dfx depends on the retail distributor distribution channel  the inability to adequately support such retail distribution channel would likely harm dfx s ability to sell and to market its products 
dfx s products have historically been distributed in the retail distributor distribution channel 
to access the retail distributor channel  dfx traditionally depended on graphics board manufacturers whose products were sold to consumers 
dfx developed a presence in the retail distributor distribution market through its own marketing efforts  as well as through the significant marketing efforts of a number of its customers 
as a result of its merger with stb systems  inc stb  dfx lost some of its largest customers  who were direct competitors of stb  and now depends primarily on its subsidiary to support the retail distributor sales channel 
although dfx successfully penetrated the retail distributor distribution channel  there can be no assurances that this success will continue in the future 
dfx s limited experience in managing and integrating organizations may result in future acquisitions or joint ventures being difficult and disruptive 
dfx regularly evaluates acquisition and joint venture opportunities and in the future dfx may make acquisitions of other companies or technologies or enter into joint ventures 
dfx s proposed merger with gigapixel is an example of such an acquisition 
these acquisitions or joint ventures may divert the time and resources of dfx s management 
further  dfx has limited experience in integrating newly acquired organizations into its operations 
acquisitions involve many risks  including difficulty in integrating or otherwise assimilating technologies  products  personnel and operations  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  issuance of dilutive equity securities and incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities  large write offs and amortized expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  loss of key employees of acquired organizations  risks of entering markets in which dfx has no or limited prior experience  and payments of cash  incurrence of debt or assumption of other liabilities to acquire other businesses 
the result of one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of dfx 
dfx s limited operating history makes the assessment of its future operating results difficult 
dfx has been shipping products only since the third quarter of this limited operating history makes the assessment of dfx s future operating results difficult 
additionally  dfx incurred net losses of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net losses in fiscal were attributable to substantial reduction in revenues due to a delayed product launch  changes in component costs with no ability to adjust pricing  additional unanticipated costs relating to the merger with stb and continuing significant costs incurred in product research  development and testing and in connection with the amortization of intangibles 
although dfx had net income of million in fiscal  historical growth rates have not been sustained in the past and may not be sustained in the future 
dfx may also be unable to sustain or to increase revenues or profits on a consistent basis in the future 
dfx s financial results depend significantly on its ability to continually develop new products and technologies 
the markets for which dfx s products and technologies are intensely competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
as a result  the financial performance of dfx depends to a significant extent on dfx s ability to successfully develop new products 
because of the rapidly changing technologies in the businesses in which dfx will operate  dfx believes that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required by dfx in the future 
to succeed in these businesses  dfx must anticipate the features and functionality that customers will demand 
dfx must then incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the design requirements of the pc  graphics chip and graphics board markets and the timing requirements of retail selling seasons 
the success of dfx s new product introductions will depend on several factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability of subcontractors and component manufacturers to effectively design and implement the manufacture of new products and technologies  the quality of new products and technologies  product and technology performance as compared to competitors products and technologies  market acceptance of dfx s and its customers products  competitive pricing of products and technologies  and introduction of new products and technologies to the market within the limited time window for retail selling seasons and oem design cycles 
as the markets for dfx s products continue to develop and competition increases  dfx anticipates that product life cycles will shorten and that the average selling prices of these products will decline 
in particular  average selling prices and  in some cases  gross margins for dfx s products and technologies will decline as those products and technologies mature 
thus  dfx will need to introduce new products and technologies to maintain average selling prices and gross margins 
to do this  dfx must successfully identify new product and technology opportunities and develop and bring new products and technologies to market in a timely manner 
dfx has in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
the failure of dfx to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or to achieve market acceptance for such products and technologies would materially harm the business and financial performance of dfx 
because dfx s products will have short product life cycles  dfx must successfully manage product transitions 
dfx s products have short product life cycles 
a failure by dfx to successfully introduce new products within a given product cycle could materially harm its business for that cycle and possibly in subsequent cycles 
any such failure could also damage dfx s brand name  reputation and relationships with its customers and cause long term harm to its business 
the pc market frequently undergoes transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
dfx s products must be able to support the new features and performance levels being required by pc manufacturers at the beginning of such a transition 
otherwise  dfx will likely lose business as well as the opportunity to compete for new design contracts until the next product transition 
an inability to develop products with required features and performance levels or even a short delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce dfx s revenues for a substantial period 
the success of dfx will depend upon continued market acceptance of its existing products  and its ability to continually develop and introduce new products and technologies and new product features and enhancements to meet changing customer requirements 
each new product cycle presents new opportunities for competitors of dfx to gain market share 
some components used in dfx s products have also historically required long lead times 
therefore  dfx may not be able to quickly reduce its production or inventory levels in response to unexpected shortfalls in sales or  conversely  to increase production in response to unexpected demand 
if dfx is unable to quickly identify  develop  manufacture or market new products and technologies or to enhance its existing products and technologies rapidly  then dfx s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because dfx has significant customer concentration  the loss of any of its significant customers would have a material adverse effect on dfx s financial performance and results of operations 
dfx s sales are highly concentrated among a limited number of customers 
for the fiscal year ended january   dfx s largest customer  ingram microd  inc  accounted for approximately of its net revenues  while dfx s largest customers collectively accounted for approximately of its net revenues 
there can be no assurance that dfx will be able to retain such customers or to continue to derive significant revenues from them 
the loss of any one of dfx s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on its financial performance and results of operations because dfx does not typically enter into long term contracts with its customers  there can be no assurance that historical sales volumes will continue in the future 
all of dfx s sales are made pursuant to purchase orders 
the lack of long term commitments  together with the customer concentration noted above  poses a significant risk to dfx 
if a single customer of dfx cancels an order or ceases to be a customer of dfx  then dfx s business and financial condition could be materially harmed 
as a result of its merger with stb  dfx lost several of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the proposed merger with gigapixel will not have a similar effect on dfx 
because dfx has limited product diversity  if dfx were unable to increase or maintain dfx s historical sales volumes  there could be a negative impact on dfx s results of operations 
dfx s revenues depend on the markets for d d and d graphics chips and boards for pcs and on dfx s ability to compete effectively in those markets 
since dfx currently has no other products  dfx s business would be materially harmed if it were unable to continue to sell these products at historical levels or to increase these historical sales levels in the future 
dfx depends on third party developers and publishers 
dfx believes that the availability of numerous high quality  commercially successful software entertainment titles and applications significantly affects sales of its products 
dfx depends on third party software developers and publishers to create  produce and market software titles that will operate with dfx s graphics chips 
only a limited number of software developers are capable of creating high quality entertainment software 
competition for these resources is intense and is expected to increase 
therefore  a sufficient number of high quality  commercially successful software titles compatible with dfx s products may not be developed 
in addition  the development and marketing of game titles that do not fully demonstrate the technical capabilities of dfx s products could create the impression that dfx s technology offers only marginal performance improvements  if any  over competing products 
dfx s dependence on single source manufacturers will expose it to significant risk if the operations of these manufacturers and other third parties are interrupted 
dfx s graphics chip products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
currently  dfx does not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for its graphics chip products and does not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility  nor does dfx expect to manufacture semiconductor wafers or to own or operate a wafer fabrication facility in the future 
taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  currently manufactures all of dfx s wafers in taiwan 
dfx obtains manufacturing services from tsmc on a purchase order basis 
dfx depends on tsmc to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields  deliver those wafers to dfx and its independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis  and allocate to dfx a portion of its manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet dfx s needs 
dfx expects to continue to be dependent upon tsmc to manufacture the semiconductor wafers used in its graphics chip products 
dfx has no readily available alternative source of supply  and it could take several months to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner 
as a result  a manufacturing disruption such as the one that occurred in september when an earthquake struck taiwan or capacity constraints experienced by tsmc would negatively impact the production of dfx s graphics chips and boards and  consequently  would have a negative effect on dfx s business and results of operations 
dfx is subject to risks relating to its single graphics board manufacturing facility 
dfx s sole graphics board manufacturing facility is located in juarez  mexico 
although a portion of dfx s board production is secured from third party sources  dfx is substantially dependent on this single manufacturing facility and any disruption of dfx s graphics board manufacturing operations at this facility would materially harm its business 
such disruption could result from various factors  including difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified manufacturing employees  difficulties associated with the use of new  reconfigured or upgraded manufacturing equipment  labor disputes  human error  governmental or political risks or a natural disaster such as an earthquake  tornado  fire or flood 
in comparison to those of its competitors that do not maintain their own graphics board manufacturing facilities  dfx incurs higher relative fixed overhead and labor costs as a result of operating its own manufacturing facility 
any failure to generate the level of product revenues needed to absorb these overhead and labor costs would materially harm dfx s business 
dfx s international operations will make it susceptible to global economic factors  foreign tax law issues  foreign business practices and currency fluctuations 
dfx relies on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations for its graphics chips  which are located in asia  and primarily relies on its own manufacturing facilities for graphics boards that are located in mexico 
dfx also has significant export sales 
these international operations subject dfx to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states 
these risks include unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for some technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in collecting payment  including increased credit exposures  potentially adverse tax consequences  including repatriation of earnings  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  unfavorable intellectual property laws  political instability  and foreign currency fluctuations 
any of these factors could materially harm the international operations and sales of dfx  and consequently  its business 
recently  financial markets in asia have experienced significant turmoil  which could harm dfx s international sales or operations 
currently  all of dfx s product sales and its arrangements with its foundry  assembly and test vendors provide for pricing and payment in us dollars 
to date  dfx has not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although dfx may do so in the future 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make dfx s products more expensive and potentially less competitive in foreign markets 
dfx may be unable to adequately protect its proprietary rights or prevent their unauthorized use  which could divert its financial resources and harm its business 
dfx s success will depend upon its proprietary technology 
dfx currently relies upon a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary technology rights 
despite current efforts to protect these proprietary rights  protective measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation or independent third party development of dfx s technology 
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions offer less protection of intellectual property rights than the laws of the united states 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in other jurisdictions 
in addition  dfx may need to litigate claims against third parties to enforce its intellectual property rights  protect its trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
on september   dfx filed suit against nvidia in northern california district federal court 
dfx s complaint alleges patent infringement relating to nvidia s use of multi texturing technology in its riva tnt product 
discovery in this case is presently under way 
this litigation  and other litigation like it  could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources 
a successful claim against dfx could effectively block its ability to use or license its technology in the united states or abroad 
the inability of dfx to protect its proprietary rights adequately could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of dfx 
dfx relies on several technology licenses from third parties  the loss of which may harm dfx s ability to develop and sell its services 
dfx currently possesses  and in the future dfx may procure  licenses from third parties relating to its services or technology 
certain of these licenses are critical to dfx s business and would be difficult to replace 
if dfx were unable to obtain or maintain these licenses  its ability to develop and to sell its products could be impaired 
if dfx or its suppliers are unable to obtain licenses  dfx could be forced to market products without some technological features 
dfx also licenses some software and technology for its operations 
if dfx were unable to obtain licenses or to obtain such licenses on competitive terms  there could be a material adverse effect on the ability of dfx to effectively offer its products 
because the markets in which dfx will operate are intensely competitive  dfx may lose market share and be forced to reduce the price of its products 
the markets in which dfx competes are intensely competitive and are likely to become more competitive in the future 
existing competitors and new market entrants may introduce products that are less costly or provide better performance or features than dfx s products 
dfx does not compete on the basis of price alone 
dfx believes that the principal competitive factors for d graphics products are product performance and quality  conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces  or apis  access to customers and distribution channels  brand awareness  price  product support  and ability to bring new products to the market in a timely manner 
many of dfx s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources than dfx 
these competitors may also have greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  lower cost structures and larger customer bases than dfx 
as a result  such competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
some of dfx s principal competitors offer a single vendor solution  because they maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from some capacity  cost and technical advantages 
dfx seeks to use strategic relationships to augment its capabilities 
however  the benefits of these relationships may not be realized or sufficient to overcome the established market positions of dfx s largest competitors 
regardless of the relative qualities of dfx s products  the market power  product breadth and customer relationships of its larger competitors can be expected to provide such competitors with substantial competitive advantages 
dfx competes primarily against companies that offer a board or chip solution to the d d pc graphics market 
these companies typically have operated in the pc d graphics market and now offer d capability as an enhancement to their d solutions 
these competitors include ati technologies  inc  s incorporated  creative technology ltd 
and nvidia corporation 
dfx also faces potential competition from companies that have focused on the high end of the d market and the production of d systems targeted for the professional engineering market  including dlabs  inc  integraph corporation and sgi 
these companies are developing lower cost versions of their d technology to bring workstation like d graphics to mainstream applications 
intel corporation also competes in the d graphics market by offering an integrated core logic d d solution aimed at the mainstream pc market 
these companies may enter the interactive electronics entertainment market  and  if they do  then dfx may not be able to compete successfully against them 
dfx now also competes with graphics board manufacturers  with suppliers who sell graphics chips directly to oems  with oems who internally produce graphics chips or integrate graphics chips on the main computer processing board of their personal computers  commonly known as the motherboard  and with the makers of other personal computer components and software that are increasingly providing graphics processing capabilities 
dfx may require additional financing to meet its future capital and operational requirements and may face uncertainty in obtaining favorable financing alternatives 
if the liquidity and cash flow from dfx s operations are insufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements  then dfx may have to seek additional financing  including public or private debt or equity offerings that may be dilutive to dfx s shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  then dfx may be unable to develop or enhance its services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
dfx s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including dfx s profitability  operational cash requirements  competitive pressures  development of new services and applications  acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies and response to unanticipated requirements 
there can be no assurance that any financing alternatives sought by dfx will be available  or  if available  will be on terms or in amounts attractive to dfx 
potential year issues may expose dfx to liability or loss 
dfx has not experienced any material adverse impact from the transition to the year even though no material adverse impact from the year transition has been noted through internal investigations and inquiries with its major customers and suppliers  dfx cannot provide any assurance that its suppliers and customers have not been affected in a manner that is not yet apparent 
dfx will continue to monitor its year compliance and the year compliance of its suppliers and customers 
litigation may divert dfx s resources and reduce the market price of dfx s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been brought against the issuing company 
it is possible that similar litigation could be brought against dfx 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and would likely divert management s attention and resources 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject dfx to significant liabilities 
a securities class action lawsuit of this type was filed october  in dallas county  texas against stb  which dfx acquired by merger in may the suit was brought against stb and some of its officers and directors and the underwriters who participated in the stb secondary offering on march  the petition alleges that the registration statement for the secondary public offering contained false and misleading statements of material facts and omitted to state material facts 
the petition asserts claims under sections  a and of the securities act of  as amended  and sections a of the texas securities act on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired stb common stock in the public offering 
the petition seeks recission and or unspecified damages 
stb denies the allegations in the petition and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
on december   a similar securities class action lawsuit was also filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  against stb and three of its officers and directors 
the action asserts claims under sections and of the securities exchange act of and rule b of the securities and exchange commission 
stb denies the allegations in the petition and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
these two securities class actions have now been consolidated 
if the plaintiffs in this consolidated lawsuit prevail in connection with any of their claims  then  depending upon the magnitude of damages and expenses incurred by dfx and the extent to which such damages and expenses are covered by insurance  the lawsuit could have a negative effect on dfx s financial condition and results of operations 
the stock price of dfx has been and may continue to be extremely volatile due to many factors  which may make it more difficult for dfx shareholders to sell their shares at prices they find attractive 
several factors have caused the stock price of dfx common stock to be extremely volatile in the past and may cause the stock price of dfx common stock to be extremely volatile in the future 
the dfx stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  the ability of dfx to successfully develop  introduce and market new or enhanced products and technologies on a timely basis  unexpected changes in demand for dfx s products and services  the pricing policies of dfx s competitors  announcements of technological innovations or new products by dfx or its competitors  changes in securities analysts recommendations  changes in the market valuations of other similarly situated companies  announcements by dfx or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  and market fluctuations and performance of the pc and graphics chip and board industries 
in addition  the trading prices of technology stocks as a whole have experienced particularly extreme price and volume fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the applicable companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of technology companies or other broad market and industry factors could depress the market price of dfx common stock  regardless of its operating performance 
market fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  may also decrease the market price of dfx s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
dfx s cash equivalents are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect interest income 
as of january   cash included money market funds and commercial paper instruments 
due to the short term nature of the investment portfolio  dfx would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
dfx does not use its investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all of dfx s sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  dfx has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
dfx does not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event exposure to foreign currency risk increases  dfx may choose to hedge those exposures
