item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section includes historical information  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by us or others 
it is important that the business discussion in item of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
historical information acquisitions in march  we acquired bgs in a stock for stock merger 
we issued million shares of common stock in the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and we have restated the prior period financial results to include those of bgs for the periods presented 
in march  we acquired boole in a stock for stock merger 
we issued million shares of common stock in the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and we have restated the prior period financial results to include those of boole for the periods presented 
in april  we acquired new dimension in a cash tender offer 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method and accordingly  new dimension s post merger financial results have been included in our fiscal financial results since the acquisition date 
in april  we acquired evity for million shares of common stock and cash of million 
stock options to purchase million common shares were issued to replace outstanding evity stock options 
because the transaction closed after the end of fiscal and was accounted for as a purchase transaction  evity s financial results are not included in our financial results through march  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income bear to total revenues 
percentage of total revenues years ended march  revenues licenses maintenance and services total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses general and administrative expenses acquired research and development amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles legal settlement merger related costs operating income interest expense interest and other income  net other income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change  net of taxes net earnings earnings total revenues in fiscal were billion  a increase over fiscal total revenues of billion 
the revenue growth was the result of a increase in north american product license revenues  a increase in international product license revenues and a increase in worldwide maintenance and services revenues 
fiscal total revenues increased over fiscal revenues of million due to increases of in north american license revenues  in international license revenues and in worldwide maintenance and services revenues 
see further discussion under revenues below 
our operating expenses excluding amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles and acquired research and development  legal and merger related costs have increased from approximately and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  to approximately of total revenues in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales and marketing costs  including sales commissions and personnel costs in our growing professional services business 
net earnings were million in fiscal  a decrease from net earnings of million in fiscal the decrease was solely due to increased charges for amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles and acquired research and development  legal and merger related costs  which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the new dimension acquisition and the settlement of a lawsuit in fiscal net income excluding these charges increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal net earnings reflected a increase over fiscal net earnings of million primarily as a result of increased revenues and interest income  a lower effective tax rate and a decrease in acquired research and development write offs from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in earnings from fiscal to fiscal was also affected by the restatement of our financial results to include boole s financial results  because boole s fiscal yearend had to be conformed to ours as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
based upon the unaudited boole financial results for the twelve month period ended march   the fiscal total revenue growth would have been approximately and the growth in net earnings would have been approximately 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
earnings per share basic earnings per share was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share was  and  respectively 
excluding amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles and acquired research and development  legal and merger related costs  basic earnings per share was  and and diluted earnings per share was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the changes in earnings per share over the three years resulted from the factors discussed under earnings above and an increase in weighted average shares outstanding 
revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions licenses north america international total licenses  maintenance and services total revenues   we generate revenues from product license fees for our computer software products  product maintenance and support fees for the associated maintenance  enhancement and support of these products and professional services fees 
we generally recognize revenue from license fees upon the execution of a software license agreement by both parties  the delivery of the underlying products and the acceptance of such products by the customer 
in transactions wherein certain of the revenue recognition criteria are not met  license revenue is deferred 
the effect of such deferral is to exclude the deferred license revenues from license revenues recognized in the period of deferral and to include them in the period in which the contractual contingencies or obligations that caused deferral have been fulfilled or have expired 
net deferred license revenues in a period is the amount of license revenues deferred into future periods reduced by the amount of previously deferred license revenues recognized in that period 
absent net deferred license revenues  license revenues would have been million higher in each of fiscal and  and would have been million lower in fiscal maintenance and support fees are recognized ratably over the maintenance term as defined in the applicable software license agreement and professional services fees are recognized as the services are provided 
for further discussion of our revenue recognition policies  refer to the discussion below and to note h to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
total revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from revenues generated by our mainframe products for the ibm os operating system and the ims and db database management systems  the expansion of our distributed systems product lines and sales channels and  to a lesser extent  higher growth rates of product maintenance and services fees 
total revenue growth of in fiscal resulted from revenues generated by our mainframe products  particularly those for db  our distributed systems product lines  the addition of the new dimension incontrol products in a purchase accounting transaction and  to a lesser extent  higher growth rates of product maintenance and services fees 
excluding incremental revenues associated with new dimension  total revenue growth was approximately for fiscal in fiscal  license fees from customers licensing our mainframe products for current and future additional processing capacity generated over one half of overall growth in total license revenues 
in fiscal  almost of license revenue growth was generated by distributed systems license fees  and license fees from customers licensing our mainframe products for current and future processing capacity generated less than one quarter of license revenue growth 
the growth in product license and maintenance fees in fiscal and was derived principally from products developed prior to fiscal product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal and no single customer represented greater than of total revenues in fiscal  and this customer base is concentrated in the top  it purchasers worldwide and  by industry  in the telecommunications  financial services and other transaction intensive sectors 
we believe that sales to repeat customers accounted for the substantial majority of total license and maintenance revenues in the periods presented 
product line revenues at march   we marketed over software products designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in mainframe  distributed computing and internet environments 
our mainframe products accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
total revenues from mainframe products grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the revenues from these products are driven largely by the growth in customers future processing capacity  as discussed below 
the high performance utilities and administrative tools for ibm s ims and db database management systems comprise the largest portion of our mainframe based revenues and total revenues 
our tools and utilities for ims databases collectively contributed  and of total revenues and  and of license revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our tools and utilities for db databases collectively contributed of total revenues and of license revenues for each of the same periods 
combined total revenues for these product lines grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to the balance of our mainframe products represented  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  representing growth of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal  in part due to the addition of new dimension 
the decline in relative revenue contribution by the mainframe product lines reflects the higher growth rates of our distributed systems products in these periods 
total revenues from distributed systems products grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to distributed systems license revenues grew and for those same periods  respectively 
distributed systems product revenue growth was derived primarily from increased market acceptance of the patrol application and data management product suite  the addition of the incontrol product family  our significant and growing investment in our distributed systems direct and indirect sales channels and higher distributed systems maintenance and services fees 
the distributed systems product lines contributed  and of total revenues and  and of license revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal and  patrol was the most significant contributor to growth in total and license revenues for distributed systems products 
for fiscal  our principal distributed systems management product lines were the patrol application and data management suite  the best performance management products  the incontrol control m job scheduling products  control d output management products and control sa security administration products  the patrol db database administration products  the sql backtrack application and database recovery products and the command post  spaceview and command mq products 
the patrol application and data management products accounted for  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  reflecting a increase from fiscal to fiscal and a increase from fiscal to the remaining distributed systems products accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  reflecting a increase from fiscal to and a increase from fiscal to the revenues from our distributed systems product offerings depend upon the continued market acceptance of our existing products and our ability to successfully develop and deliver additional products for the distributed systems environment 
we have experienced rapid growth in our distributed systems product lines since their introduction in late fiscal the distributed systems market is highly competitive and dynamic and there can be no assurance that this growth will continue 
product license revenues our product license revenues consist of product license fees and license upgrade fees 
product license fees are all fees associated with a customer s licensing of a given software product for the first time 
license upgrade fees are all fees associated with a customer s purchase of the right to run a previously licensed product on a larger computer or computers 
license upgrade fees are primarily generated by our mainframe products and include fees associated both with current and future additional processing capacity 
effective april  we adopted a modified definition of product license and product upgrade fees as discussed below under the heading definitions of license revenue categories 
our north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to distributed systems product license fees were the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by increased capacity based license upgrade fees 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to increased licensing of our distributed systems products was the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by capacity based license upgrade fees 
international license revenues were slightly increased by the strengthening of the dollar against local currencies from fiscal to fiscal and were decreased by due to foreign currency exchange rate changes from fiscal to after giving effect to our foreign currency hedging program 
the sustainability and growth of our mainframe based license revenues are dependent upon capacity based license upgrade fees  particularly within our largest customer accounts 
during fiscal  license upgrade fees for current and future processing capacity accounted for of our total revenues and of our total license revenues 
most of our largest customers have entered into enterprise license agreements allowing them to install our products on any number of cpus  subject to a maximum limit on the aggregate processing power of the cpus as measured in mips 
additional license upgrade fees are due if the mips limit is exceeded 
substantially all of these transactions include license upgrade fees associated with additional processing capacity beyond the customers current usage levels  and some include product license fees for additional products 
in our typical enterprise license transactions  the fees associated with future additional mainframe processing capacity comprise from one half to substantially all of the license fees received in these transactions 
over the last several years  we experienced a strong increase in demand from our mainframe customers for the right to run our products on increased future mainframe processing capacity 
this led to larger single transactions with higher per mips discounts 
although growth in mainframe capacity based license upgrade fees slowed in fiscal  we expect that we will continue to be dependent upon these capacity related license upgrade fees 
there can be no assurance  however  that the demand for mainframe processing capacity or the perceived benefits of our core mainframe products will continue 
the slowing of this demand adversely impacts our mainframe license revenues and operating results 
see the discussion below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
definitions of license revenue categories we license our products primarily in two ways by copy and on an enterprise license basis by aggregate licensed capacity 
when products are licensed on a per copy basis  license revenues from the initial licensing of each copy of the product are product license fees 
all revenues from the customer s licensing of the right to use a previously licensed copy on a larger computer are license upgrade fees 
when products are licensed on an enterprise aggregate licensed processing capacity basis  all license revenues associated with the first time licensing of such products are product license fees 
all revenues associated with the licensing of a previously licensed product to operate on additional aggregate processing capacity are license upgrade fees 
the definition of product license fees received when a product is licensed on an aggregate licensed capacity basis became effective for fiscal and represents a change from our practices prior to acquiring boole and new dimension 
previously in aggregate licensed capacity transactions  revenues associated with the first time licensing of a product were allocated between revenues associated with the customer s current processing capacity  which were categorized as product license fees  and revenues associated with future processing capacity  which were categorized as license upgrade fees 
now all of these fees are categorized as product license fees 
the effect of this change is to increase the amount of revenues allocated to product license fees and to decrease the amount of revenues allocated to license upgrade fees 
for large enterprise license transactions that include newly licensed products  the effect of this change is significant 
this change solely impacts our internal characterization of license revenues and has no effect on license revenue recognition 
maintenance and support revenues  services revenues maintenance and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in our software maintenance  enhancement and support program  and services revenues represent fees from professional services  including implementation  education and complementary services  performed during the period 
maintenance and support enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
these fees are generally charged annually and equal to of the discounted price of the product 
in addition  customers are entitled to reduced maintenance percentages for prepayment of annual maintenance fees 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per mips basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for mainframe products 
historically  we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
to date  we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
professional services revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years  more than doubling from fiscal to fiscal  as a result of our heightened focus on this increasingly important element in the value equation for our customers 
our professional services headcount has grown steadily throughout fiscal and to meet the increasing demand for our expanding service offerings 
expenses percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in millions selling and marketing research and development cost of maintenance services and product licenses general and administrative acquired research and development amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles n a legal settlement merger related costs total operating expenses  selling and marketing our selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars  and represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
personnel costs and sales commissions were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and selling and marketing year end headcount increased by from fiscal to fiscal  and by from fiscal to the headcount increases during fiscal and were primarily attributable to significant increases in our professional services business  distributed systems sales representatives and technical sales support consultants 
the fiscal increase also included the addition of new dimension personnel 
sales commissions increased in fiscal and  as a result of the and increases  respectively  in license revenues 
in fiscal  commission plan adjustments also contributed to the increased sales commission expense 
marketing costs have continued to increase to meet the requirements of marketing a greater number of increasingly complex distributed systems solutions and to support a growing indirect distribution channel 
selling and marketing expenses were further impacted by a major re branding effort which began in the first quarter of fiscal and significantly higher levels of expenses for travel and office rent 
research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain our data processing center 
increases in our research and development expenses for fiscal and were primarily the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits and facilities costs 
we increased our headcount in the research and development organization by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to  including the addition of new dimension personnel 
research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize our software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
during fiscal  and  we capitalized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of internal software development costs 
the growth in capitalized costs is primarily due to increases in distributed systems product development and platform compatibility efforts 
cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of amortization of purchased and internally developed software  costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of our products and royalty fees 
maintenance  enhancement and support costs are increasing as a percentage of maintenance fees as our product revenue mix shifts to distributed systems  which require a higher level of support 
we amortized million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of capitalized internal software development costs pursuant to sfas no 
in these periods  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of capitalized software development costs to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
these software products were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues which would be necessary for us to realize the carrying value of the assets 
we expect our cost of maintenance services and product licenses will continue to increase as we capitalize a higher level of software development costs and as we build our distributed systems product support organization  which is less cost effective than our mainframe support organization because of the complexity and variability of the environments in which the products operate 
the distributed systems products operate in a high number of operating environments  including operating systems  database management systems and erp applications  and require greater ongoing platform support development activity relative to our os mainframe products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  product distribution  facilities management and human resources 
other expenses included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance and costs of managing our foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs  increased professional services fees and higher costs associated with the infrastructure to support our growth 
fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew by from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal acquired research and development in executing its product strategies  we employ both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and  in the case of boole  bgs and new dimension  established software companies 
we believe that time to market is critical to our success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market  where we must compete with well established companies such as ibm  and where our products must integrate with the predominate database management systems  operating systems  network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment 
accordingly  we must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into our existing product architecture 
the developers of the acquired technologies are often small  early stage software companies with minimal to no revenues  quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace 
this strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to our overall development plans 
over the last several years  some of the acquired technologies were successfully completed and integrated  while others were not 
the following table presents information concerning the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method for fiscal  and acquired goodwill total software ipr d and other price in millions fiscal datatools others fiscal nastel envive fiscal new dimension we acquired datatools in may  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
datatools owned certain database management system specific back up products that were sold as stand alone products 
its flagship product is called sql backtrack sql bt 
at the acquisition date  datatools was in the process of developing numerous products and enhanced versions of products  including next generation versions of sql bt for the informix platform sbi and the oracle platform sbo  as well as first generation products for the microsoft sql sbm and sybase idr sbs i platforms 
we allocated approximately million to in process research and development ipr d 
the four most significant development projects  which comprised million of the ipr d  pertained to the products above 
the primary remaining efforts associated with the ipr d included code completion in several key areas  such as logical extraction and piecemeal back up and recovery bu r  large database support and performance related functionality 
the following summarizes the status of the four primary projects we completed and released the sbm product in april the sbo product was released in june for both the nt and unix environments 
the ipr d was successfully completed resulting in new functionality in several areas  including back up and recovery scheduling  remote bu r  archive log management and a graphical user interface 
we abandoned the sbs i project based on concerns over market demand and the allocation of sybase resources to the core sybase product 
we released version of the sbi product in april the completion of the in process technology resulted in added functionality  including selective recovery of tables  as opposed to full back ups  which increases flexibility and efficiency 
this version also allows for incremental restart if a recovery is interrupted  eliminating the need to run the entire recovery again 
in june  we acquired technology from sento technical innovations  inc we have since abandoned the technology and expensed the entire purchase price 
in july  we acquired certain software code from software partners  inc for a total purchase price of million 
we allocated million of the purchase price to completed technology and million to ipr d 
the allocation of purchase price to completed technology reflects the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the customers using the existing technology 
this code permits file system back up and recovery  but was not competitive with the leading products in this market 
we initially planned on completing this code and integrating it into the patrol recovery manager product 
these efforts were unsuccessful and we abandoned this project 
in the latter part of fiscal  we were in the process of designing a middleware management product to assist customers with optimizing middleware performance and with handling enterprise environmental changes 
in this regard  in april  we acquired a license from nastel technologies  inc nastel for certain infrastructure source code for use in its mq management product that was under development  but had not yet reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  we allocated the entire million purchase price to ipr d 
we completed the acquired ipr d by creating an effective installation routine  developing an automated mq configuration routine  fortifying the underlying nastel database and modifying the code to work in environments with complementary management products 
upon completion of the ipr d  we completed the initial related product after developing efficient data collection  user interface and business logic code 
in june  we entered into a technology agreement with envive corporation envive primarily to strengthen our erp business management solutions to provide better diagnostic and correlation ability  service level management and end to end monitoring capability 
we also secured the rights to distribute certain products in the sap management market 
our committed costs associated with the transaction approximated million 
we allocated million of the transaction costs to software assets  prepaid royalties and interest 
the remaining million was allocated to acquired ipr d that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the transaction 
we believe the acquired ipr d was approximately complete towards development of end to end and service level management functionality across the major erp platforms at the acquisition date 
we incurred a nominal level of development costs in fiscal in fiscal  we evaluated the levels of commitment and effort required to develop the above mentioned functionality in the non sap environments and determined such development would not be pursued 
in april  we acquired through a public tender offer in excess of of the outstanding ordinary shares of new dimension 
total consideration paid approximated million  including the cost of the remaining outstanding shares acquired during fiscal and the historical cost of approximately million for shares of new dimension previously owned by boole 
unrealized gains of approximately million related to these new dimension shares included in long term investment securities and accumulated other comprehensive income at march   were eliminated when the acquisition was recorded 
we allocated million to software assets  million to goodwill and other intangibles and million to equipment  receivables and other non software assets  net of liabilities assumed 
we allocated million  or of the purchase price  to ipr d  which represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility nor had alternative future use 
new dimension grouped its product lines into five categories i enterprise production management  ii enterprise output management  iii enterprise event management  iv enterprise security management and v tandem solutions 
new dimension s primary ipr d efforts can be summarized into four categories i integrated operations architecture r for the enterprise ioa r e  ii odaiko  iii e business enablement and iv security 
the following summarizes these efforts at the time of the acquisition and the status of the development as of march  integrated operations architecture for the enterprise 
ioa e was to be the supporting infrastructure for all of the distributed systems products from new dimension  similar to the integrated operations architecture for new dimension s mainframe products 
this project  as originally intended  has been cancelled as we determined it was more appropriate to gradually extend the existing distributed systems infrastructure rather than to replace it 
odaiko 
odaiko was to be the next major release of the output management family of products focused specifically on broadening this product family from purely a mainframe output management system to an enterprise wide document and output management product family 
at the time of the acquisition  this product family supported a document archive only on the mainframe  viewing of reports on a terminal or a pc and distribution of the reports to network connected printers 
odaiko  renamed control d for distributed systems  will not only enable the end user to view the archived reports via a web browser but will also give them the ability to customize the view of the data  making it easier for the customer to create e business applications 
this requires the interpretation of a variety of document formats eg  xerox  ibm  microsoft and transformation of those formats into jpeg or html formats easily read via a web browser 
some components of this product suite were released during fiscal and the remainder are scheduled for general availability in september e business enablement 
e business enablement is the development of the infrastructure necessary to internet ize the entire new dimension product family 
each of the products that will utilize e business enablement are internet applications which not only provide a browser based front end but also are brand new applications with new and important functionality that customers require 
the beta versions of two of these products are scheduled for release in fiscal security 
at the acquisition date  the security market was new for new dimension 
customers have accepted the technology offered in current products and are asking for additional features and add on applications to enable them to make better use of these applications 
the technology at the acquisition date supported the administration of passwords and user ids of security systems eg  racf  topsecret  acf  seos  applications eg  lotus notes  sap r  microsoft exchange  databases eg  oracle  informix  ms sql server and operating systems eg  unix  microsoft windows nt 
it does this by placing an agent on each managed node along with a module  which understands how to communicate with each resident security system rss 
these agent module combinations communicate with a repository and the enterprise security station console 
customer requirements drive the porting of the agent to each new operating system and platform as well as to support new rsss 
key ipr d projects at the acquisition date involved the support of new rsss including firewalls  erp applications  and other security systems and platforms eg  tandem 
additional features within the ipr d project include the ability to have users request and create new passwords and user ids 
these passwords and user ids would then be utilized or synchronized across all of the applications and systems that a user accesses 
this technology has been completed  is web based and allows end users to enter their user id and password and automatically register it with the appropriate applications  then trigger the synchronization job  while allowing for the system to monitor access 
a significant portion of the ipr d value also relates to the i control m  ii control d  iii control sa  and iv enterprise controlstation r ecs tm products 
the following is a summary of the primary ipr d related to these products control m new two tier architecture for large sysplex environments an independent database layer one source code for all supported databases functionality allowing for the ability to perform actions on a group of projects control d repository for providing multi level  global indexing of data sysplex support control d technology for the windows nt environment control sa security for managing users of internet e commerce applications enhanced administration of control access rights ability to access and manage various enterprise applications password synchronization ecs functionality allowing for the ability to perform actions on a group of projects mass environment management on windows nt platform enhanced diagnostics and problem determination tools compatibility with oracle databases certain of these projects were completed during fiscal and the related products are generally available  others have been released as beta versions for customer testing and evaluation  and the remainder are still in process 
as of the date of the new dimension acquisition  we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential use of the technology in different products  the stage of development and life cycle of each project  resale of the software and internal use 
as such  the value of the purchased ipr d was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
we intend to continue devoting effort to developing commercially viable products from the purchased ipr d  although we may not develop such commercially viable products 
all of the foregoing estimates and projections were based on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time  but which were inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
the values assigned to acquired ipr d in the above mentioned transactions were generally determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at estimated after tax cash flows 
operating expenses were estimated based on historical results and anticipated profit margins and included cost of goods sold  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses  including estimated costs to maintain the products once they have been introduced into the market and are generating revenue 
due to purchasing power increases and general economies of scale  estimated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were  in some cases  estimated to decrease after the acquisitions 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations and venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and the developmental nature of the projects  discount rates of to were used to value the acquired ipr d 
a discount rate was used to value the new dimension acquired ipr d and a rate was used in discounting the cash flows associated with the developed new dimension technology 
we believe these discount rates are commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
if the acquired ipr d projects are not successfully completed  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles in connection with the application of the purchase accounting method to our acquisitions  portions of the purchase prices were allocated to goodwill  workforce  customer base  software and other intangible assets 
we are amortizing these intangibles over four to five year periods which reflect the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the increase in amortization expense is directly related to the acquisition of new dimension in april legal settlement in october  we settled all claims in a lawsuit styled bmc software  inc  plaintiff  vs 
peregrine bridge transfer corp  skunkware  inc  neon systems  inc  peregrine systems  inc  wayne e 
fisher and john j 
moores  defendants  vs 
bmc software  inc and max p 
watson  counter defendants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
merger related costs pursuant to the close of our merger with boole in march  management approved a formal plan of restructuring the plan which included steps to be taken to fully integrate the operations of the two companies  consolidate duplicate facilities  and eliminate redundant positions to achieve reductions in overhead expenses in future periods 
in connection with the merger and the plan  at march  we accrued approximately million in merger related costs 
this accrual included direct transaction costs  such as investment banking  legal and accounting fees and approximately million for settlement of a suit brought against boole for allegedly breaching a standstill and exclusive negotiating agreement with platinum technology international  inc the remainder of the accrual represented management s best estimate  based on available information as of march   of identifiable and quantifiable charges we would incur as a result of the actions to be taken under the plan 
the accrued restructuring charges at march  included estimates of involuntary termination benefits for domestic employees and international employees  located primarily in europe  including the executive management of boole and various redundant administrative and support personnel 
the accrual also included charges for incremental costs to exit certain office lease arrangements  for idle facilities and for asset writedowns of office furniture and fixtures and computer hardware 
during fiscal  we made certain revisions to the plan including the following the termination of approximately additional employees  primarily in the united states and europe  the accrual of other termination benefits which were contingent upon certain performance criteria  revisions to the original exit strategy for certain operating leases for office space in the united states and europe  and the accrual for termination costs for certain operating leases for computer hardware and equipment 
additionally  in conjunction with the new dimension acquisition  we accrued estimated costs to terminate certain operating leases for duplicate office space 
the activity in the accrual for merger related costs for the year ended march   was as follows paid out or balance at revision of charged against balance at march  the the related march  accrual assets in millions direct transaction costs facility costs and write down of fixed assets to be disposed of employee termination benefits other merger related costs total accrual the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of march  the remaining accruals primarily relate to severance and lease payments to be made in future periods 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and to a lesser degree  financed receivables and interest expense on short term borrowings 
other income  net increased by from fiscal to and decreased by from fiscal to the increase in fiscal is primarily due to higher interest income earned on larger invested cash and investment balances and the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to interest expense of million incurred on short term borrowings to fund the new dimension acquisition 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a non recurring benefit to our provision for income taxes to reflect a settlement with the internal revenue service 
during fiscal  the decreased effective income tax rate is the result of lower taxes associated with our european operations and the effect of tax exempt interest on certain investments 
for further discussion of the non recurring benefit in fiscal and an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
recently issued accounting pronouncements as of april  and we adopted aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as of april  we adopted aicpa sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
this sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in the fourth quarter of fiscal sfas no 
redefines derivative instruments and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value  with changes in the instruments fair value to be recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes new criteria for transactions to qualify for hedge accounting 
adoption resulted in a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  net of tax 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  was issued in june and amends certain provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for us for all fiscal quarters beginning after june   and we believe that adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
sab no 
is effective as of the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after december   and requires companies to report any changes in revenue recognition as a cumulative change in accounting principle at the time of implementation 
we do not believe that adoption of sab no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended march  and this information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all periods in fiscal have been restated to include the results of boole  as required by the pooling of interests method of accounting 
our quarterly results are subject to seasonality and can be volatile and difficult to predict accurately prior to a quarter s end as discussed under certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
historical quarterly financial results and trends may not be indicative of future results

shares used in computing diluted eps liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion  approximately even with the march  balance 
our working capital as of march   was million  reflecting a decrease from the march  balance of million due to the remaining short term borrowings of million related to the new dimension acquisition as discussed below 
we continue to invest cash in securities with maturities beyond one year 
while typically yielding greater returns  this reduces reported working capital 
our securities are investment grade and highly liquid 
stockholders equity as of march   was billion 
we continue to primarily finance our growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily related to the new dimension acquisition  the purchase of investment securities  acquisition of computers and related equipment and construction of an expansion to our corporate headquarters 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  which derived primarily from short term borrowings related to the new dimension acquisition as discussed below 
during fiscal  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
our board of directors terminated the share buy back program in march prior to consummation of the bgs merger consistent with the pooling of interests accounting provisions 
subsequent to march   the board of directors authorized us to purchase up to million in common stock 
we plan to buy stock on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
as part of our acquisition of new dimension in the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a million credit facility with a consortium of us banks 
the facility consists of a a day revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with renewal options by the lenders and with a one year option granted to us to convert the revolving loans into a one year term loan  and b a competitive bid facility that allows us to request bids from the lenders for loans on a negotiated basis up to the existing availability under the credit facility 
interest accrues on the loans under the revolving credit facility at a margin above libor based on certain of our financial ratios 
as of march   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at a weighted average annual interest rate of 
the credit facility includes  among others  covenants regarding our maintenance of at least million in cash and marketable securities and certain financial ratios 
we had no other debt as of march   other than normal trade payables  accrued liabilities and deferred tax liabilities 
we believe that our existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results our stock price is volatile our stock price has been and is highly volatile 
our stock price is highly influenced by current expectations of sustained future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
our historical financial results should not be seen as indicative of future results 
the timing and size of license contracts could cause our quarterly revenues and earnings to fluctuate our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially 
the timing and amount of our license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
we generally operate with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of our sales are closed at the end of each quarter 
our business remains dependent on closing large enterprise license transactions  which can have sales cycles of up to a year or more and require approval by a customer s upper management 
these transactions are typically difficult to manage and predict 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction or multiple expected transactions could cause our revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
we generally do not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expectations until the final days or day of a quarter 
we have a high degree of operating leverage our business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage 
a substantial portion of our operating costs and expenses consist of employee and facility related costs  which are relatively fixed over the short term 
in addition  our expense levels and hiring plans are based substantially on our projections of future revenues 
if near term demand weakens in a given quarter  there would likely be a material adverse effect on operating results and a resultant drop in our stock price 
our operating margins have declined further there is a risk that our high operating margins may not be sustainable and may continue to decline  which would adversely affect our earnings 
our operating margins  excluding amortization of goodwill  acquired technology and intangibles and one time charges  declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal and prior periods 
we do not compile margin analysis other than on an aggregated basis  however  we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are substantially higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since our mix of business continues to shift to distributed systems revenues  operating margins will experience more pressure 
in addition  we are not currently profitable in our growing professional services business 
we may be unable to increase or even maintain our current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
additionally  we have acquired businesses experiencing lower operating margins than us 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel our future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing and support personnel 
there is currently a shortage of personnel possessing the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
hiring qualified sales  marketing  administrative  research and development and customer support personnel is very competitive in our industry  particularly in some of the markets where our development teams are located  such as san jose  california  austin  texas and waltham  massachusetts 
in addition to our direct competitors  we are competing for qualified personnel with start ups and small companies  many of which are offering significant ownership interests in the form of stock options to attract employees 
in competing with start ups and other high growth companies  our recent stock price performance  with our shares trading in the same price range as a year ago and two years ago  has made it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees 
consequently  our growth rates may be limited by our ability to attract qualified personnel 
decreasing demand for mainframe processing capacity could adversely affect revenues fees from enterprise license transactions remain a fundamental component of our revenues and the primary source of mainframe license revenues 
these revenues depend on our customers planning to grow their mainframe hardware capacity and continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity in future periods 
over the past nine months  ibm has experienced a decline in shipments of new mainframe hardware capacity which it attributed primarily to year concerns 
in addition  the continued growth of distributed database management systems may have an adverse effect on growth rates for mainframe computing systems 
although we believe that businesses will continue to demand greater mainframe computing capacity and that e business will be a driver of this demand  there can be no assurance as to whether future demand for mainframe capacity will continue to grow or not 
slower growth in our customers mainframe processing capacity would adversely affect our revenues 
increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely affect our sales the market for systems management software has been increasingly competitive for the past number of years and is currently intensifying 
we compete with a variety of software vendors including ibm and ca 
we derived approximately of our total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues to focus on reducing the overall software costs associated with the os mainframe platform 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to aggressively enhance its utilities for ims and db to provide lower cost alternatives to the products provided by us and other independent software vendors 
ibm has significantly increased its level of activity in the ims and db high speed utility markets over the last two years 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with our ims  db and other products at a lower cost  our business will be materially adversely affected 
ca entered the mainframe database tools and utilities market with its acquisition of platinum db tools and utilities and idi ims tools and utilities and is competing with us in these markets 
capacity based upgrade fees associated with both current and future processing capacity contributed approximately one fourth to one third of our total revenues in each of fiscal years  and historically  these fees were not separately captured by boole  however  the addition of boole has not significantly changed the contribution of these fees to total revenues 
the charging of upgrade fees based on the capacity to which the product is licensed is standard among mainframe systems software vendors  including ibm 
while we believe our current pricing policies properly reflect the value provided by our products  the pricing of mainframe systems software and particularly the charging of capacity based upgrade fees is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
ibm continues to reduce the costs of its mainframe systems software to increase the overall cost competitiveness of its mainframe hardware and software products 
ibm also generally charges less for its software products 
these actions continue to increase pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
we have continued to reduce the cost of our mainframe tools and utilities in response to these and other competitive pressures 
maintenance revenue growth could slow maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase as the processing capacity on which the products are installed increases  consequently  we receive higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install our products on additional processing capacity 
due to increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per mips basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for our mainframe products 
historically  we have enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for our mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to our products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of our maintenance revenues 
to date  we have been successful in extending our traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
renewal rates for maintenance on our distributed systems products are lower than on our mainframe products 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect our earnings if we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
during the past year  funding for new ventures and start ups in our industry has been at an all time high with many new technological advancements and competing products entering the marketplace 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets 
our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of our existing distributed systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products 
we have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of our distributed systems products  and expect to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or distributed systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
because the market for e business solutions is new and evolving  we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate of this market or its ultimate size we are increasingly focusing our selling and marketing efforts on providing solutions for e business applications 
this is a new and evolving market  and there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for or accept our e business solutions 
in addition  our success in the e business market may ultimately depend on the success of the internet as a medium for conducting business transactions 
as the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and the complexity of web based applications increases  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it or the performance or reliability of the internet might be adversely affected 
failure of a significant market to develop for e business application solutions  failure of our e business solutions to achieve broad market acceptance  or reduced growth in the internet as a medium for business transactions could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in pricing practices could adversely affect revenues and earnings we may choose in fiscal or a future fiscal year to make changes to our product packaging  pricing or licensing programs 
if made  such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings 
our customers may not accept our product strategies historically  we have focused on selling software products to address specific customer problems associated with their applications 
we are now increasingly moving toward integrating multiple software products and offering packaged solutions for customers systems 
there can be no assurance that customers will perceive a need for such solutions 
in addition  there may be technical difficulties in integrating individual products into a combined solution that may delay the introduction of such solutions to the market or adversely affect the demand for such solutions 
risks related to business combinations as part of our overall strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and plan to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
our acquisitions of bgs in march  boole in march  new dimension in april and evity in april are the results of this strategy 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that we may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful integration of acquired businesses  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in order for us to maximize the return on our investments in acquired companies  the products of these entities must be integrated with our existing products 
these integrations can be difficult and unpredictable  especially given the complexity of software and that acquired technology is typically developed independently and designed with no regard to integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our product integration efforts or that we will realize the expected benefits 
with each of our acquisitions  we have initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products of these companies 
retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
we have implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees  nonetheless  we have lost some key employees and may lose others in the future 
risks associated with managing growth we have experienced an extended period of i significant revenue growth  ii acquisitions  iii expansion of our software product lines and supported platforms  iv significant expansion in our number of employees  v increased pressure on the viability and scope of our operating and financial systems  and vi expansion in the geographic scope of our operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and has placed a significant strain upon our management  operating and financial controls and resources  including our information systems and services and development organizations 
to accommodate recent growth  compete effectively and manage potential future growth  we must continue to implement and improve the speed and quality of our information decision support systems  management decisions  reporting systems  procedures and controls 
our personnel  procedures  systems and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
during fiscal  we realigned our product development and marketing operations along five product market oriented groups 
it is uncertain if this reorganization will yield the desired benefits and whether this organizational structure will prove effective 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary 
there can also be no assurance that our intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
possibility of infringement claims from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect that software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlap 
in addition  we expect to receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software and business methods  especially in light of recent developments in the law that extend the ability to patent software and business methods 
regardless of its merit  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
risk of year related problems through the six months following january   we have not experienced any material failures related to year  however  there remains a risk that latent year problems could affect us or our products 
we have tested the ability of our software products to process year data without interruption or errors and believe that our products are substantially year compliant 
despite these tests  there can be no assurance that undetected errors or defects do not exist that could cause these software products to fail to process year data correctly 
there is a risk that such undetected errors or defects could surface at a later date  and that customers may assert claims against us for any losses resulting from such errors or defects 
to date  we are not aware of any material claims being asserted or made against us related to year failures 
however  we cannot predict whether or to what extent any legal claims will be brought  or whether we will suffer any liability as a result of any adverse consequences to our customers related to year failures 
risks related to international operations and the euro currency we have committed  and expect to continue to commit  substantial resources and funding to build our international service and support infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including many of those in which we operate  are higher than in the united states 
in order to increase international sales in fiscal and subsequent periods  we must continue to globalize our software product lines  expand existing and establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by our international offices  particularly our european operations 
revenue growth by our european operations has been slower than revenue growth in north america 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in accelerating the revenue growth of our european operations 
our operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
generally  our foreign sales are denominated in our foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  we could have significant gains or losses 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally 
the european union s adoption of the euro single currency raises a variety of issues associated with our european operations 
although the transition will be phased in over several years  the euro became europe s single currency on january  our foreign exchange exposures to legacy sovereign currencies of the participating countries in the euro became foreign exchange exposures to the euro upon its introduction 
although we are not aware of any material adverse financial consequences of the change from legacy sovereign currencies to the euro  conversion may result in problems  which may have an adverse impact on our business since we may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy these problems 
conditions in israel our incontrol operations are conducted partially in israel and  accordingly  we are directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
israel s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors  including a period of rampant inflation in the early to mid s  low foreign exchange reserves  fluctuations in world commodity prices  military conflicts and civil unrest 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and the arab countries 
in addition  israel and companies doing business with israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the arab countries since israel s establishment 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
in addition  certain of our incontrol employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
new dimension operated effectively under these requirements since its inception 
however  we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on incontrol s operations in the future 
possible adverse impact of recent accounting pronouncements on april  and we adopted aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  respectively 
the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
based on our reading and interpretation of these sops  we believe that our current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the american institute of certified public accountants and its software revenue recognition task force will continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize our risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we utilize certain derivative financial instruments 
we primarily utilize two types of derivative financial instruments in managing our foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to achieve hedges of firm commitments that subject us to transaction risk 
the terms of these forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are typically entered into at the prevailing market rate at the end of the month 
forward exchange contracts and net purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the euro and british pound  in europe  and the japanese yen and australian dollar in the asia pacific region 
we perform comparisons  on a monthly basis  of the forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts and the forecasted sales revenues to determine hedge effectiveness 
while we actively manage our foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance our foreign currency hedging activities will offset the full impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position during fiscal years  or based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   and our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect 
we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred 
interest rate risk investments we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities approximated billion at march   and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
based on our financial position  results of operations and net cash flows for the year ended march   we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not have a material effect 
we used a value at risk model to measure potential market risk on our investment securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred
