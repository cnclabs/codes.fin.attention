item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we received our initial funding from a public issuance of ordinary shares in the united kingdom in november in may  we completed a public financing in the us resulting in the issuance of  units  each consisting of one ordinary share and one a and one b warrant for the purchase of an equivalent number of ordinary shares 
the ordinary shares were issued as american depositary shares  evidenced by american depositary receipts  and together with the a and b warrants  were traded under the nasdaq automated quotations system 
 unexercised a and  unexercised b warrants ceased trading upon the lapsing of their respective extended exercise dates in may since may  we have relied on private placements of ordinary shares  convertible debentures and warrants to add to our capital base 
our accounts set forth in part iv of this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
our financial information included in this form k is presented in us dollars 
material changes in financial condition during the year ended december   our liquid position  represented by cash and deposits at banks and liquid investments  increased by  to  this increase is attributable to the excess of net proceeds from the issue of new investment notes over operational losses  movements in net working capital and capital expenditure as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 
results of operations our operations are carried out in the areas of pharmaceuticals development and drug delivery systems development pharmaceuticals and the supply of skincare products cosmeceuticals to licensees

our product sales revenues of  for the year ended december  comprised  from the sale of named patient products   from the sale of monoclonal antibodies  and  from the sale of skincare products 
the overall sales increase of was represented by an increase of skincare sales of and a decrease in pharmaceutical sales  comprising named patient sales and monoclonal antibodies sales of the decrease in sales of named patient products is due to temporary suspensions of named patient sales of invicorp tm in the united kingdom 
this was done following a possible batch sterility problem with our contract manufacturer and possible toxicological findings on phentolamine mesylate submitted to the fda by a competitor 
this competitor is also developing an erectile dysfunction product 
the uk medicines control agency supported the resumption of named patient sales after reviewing the fda findings and our initial response 
the decrease in sales of monoclonal antibodies was mainly due to lower volumes of sales in the first quarter of sales of monoclonal antibodies  some of which are used for the early diagnosis of alzeimers disease  follow sales patterns determined by project driven research organizations and are subject to fluctuation 
the increase in sales of skincare products was mainly due to sales of kinetin products to icn pharmaceuticals inc under a licensing and supply agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of under this agreement  icn has agreed to sell and distribute a product called kinerase to the professional dermatological market in north america 
in may  exclusive rights for the worldwide distribution of mill creek r and silver fox r products were granted to united states international trading corporation usitc 
in return for the grant of the distribution rights  ccsi received a  license fee and will receive guaranteed minimum quarterly royalties based on net sales from september ccsi also sold its trading inventories to usitc for  on december   we entered into a license and supply agreement with obaji medical products for the exclusive marketing and distribution of kinetin products in the mass marketing channel of distribution in a number of major asian countries 
also  obaji receives exclusivity for kinetin in the multi level marketing channel of distribution in taiwan 
for the grant of the distribution rights the agreement calls for senetek to receive  license fees 
of this  we received  in and we expect the balance to be received in we have recorded these fees as deferred income and will recognize revenue under the terms of the agreement 
our sales revenues of  for comprised  from the sale of named patient products   from the sales of monoclonal antibodies and  from the sale of skincare products 
the overall sales decrease of  comparing to was represented by an increase in pharmaceutical sales  comprising named patient sales and monoclonal antibodies sales of and a decrease in skincare sales of 
the increase in named patient sales was due to a increase in volume and an increase in price 
the increase in sales of monoclonal antibodies was due to an increase in sales volume 
the decrease in sales of skincare products was due to the efficient streamlining of the product line by eliminating low gross margin products 
cost of sales cost of goods sold for the year ended december   which includes contract manufacturing and material costs  was  up from the year ended december  due to increased sales of high margin products  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was for the year ended december  compared to for year ended december  the cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decrease is due to increased sales of higher margin products especially kinetin products 
this follows the launch of kinerase products by icn pharmaceuticals in the dermatological sector of the skincare market towards the end of the first quarter of in the pharmaceutical sector  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  down from  from the year ended december  this is due mainly to a decrease in sales volume following the temporary suspension of invicorp tm named patient sales in the united kingdom 
in the skincare sector  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  an increase of from  for the year ended december  this is mainly due to the effect of increased sales volumes and a favorable change to high margin products in the sales mix  following the launch of the kinerase products in march research and development pharmaceutical division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared with was primarily due to o substantially reduced levels of phase clinical trials for invicorp tm as these reach completion in europe and we receive marketing authorization approvals o reduction in headcount of persons in senetek research and development us in the third quarter of and the closure of our st louis facility 
reduction in headcount of persons in senetek research and development uk in the second quarter of reduction in headcount of persons in sddt research and development in the third quarter of o one time purchase of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine mesylate for  in o reduced spending levels on reliaject tm and invicorp tm in the fourth quarter of as we developed a new drug delivery strategy for invicorp tm utilizing a cost effective  state of the art delivery system 
o reduced levels of external consultancy in the area of regulatory affairs the increase of  in compared with was primarily due to o further spending on pivotal clinical studies  toxicology studies including a transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study and regulatory affairs for our invicorp tm and adrenaject tm products o one time purchase of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine mesylate for  in skincare division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increase of  in compared with is mainly due to additional formulation work undertaken on our kinetin plus products 
the decrease of  in compared with was primarily due to the streamlining of our cosmetic product portfolio and the elimination of production development expenses following the decision to outsource manufacturing in the second quarter of general and administrative pharmaceutical division general and administrative expenses totaled  for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to was primarily due to o this decrease is mainly due to the net savings arising from the corporate consolidation and cost reduction program 
the main results of the program were the substantial reduction of our headcount and the consolidation of offices mentioned below 
we incurred one time costs in our corporate restructuring program  which was launched at the beginning of in may we closed our uk  london operations and combined those functions in our uk kettering office 
we also pared down our uk clinical monitoring and development staff and have substantially moved these functions to our napa office 
the reduction in headcount was people and the severance packages of  which included full settlement with a former director  were expensed in the second quarter of also  during the third quarter of we closed our st louis research facility and transferred their functions to napa 
there were no significant one time costs incurred  arising from the closure of the st 
louis facility 
the financial impact of the st louis closure are annualized savings of approximately  in salaries and office overheads 
furthermore  we settled our legal disputes with a former director and consultant and recognized the settlement costs of  in the second quarter of also  in the third quarter we executed release and separation agreements with our former chairman and ceo and our former president and coo both of whom left our employment towards the end of the fourth quarter in the case of the chairman and ceo there were no settlement costs and million stock options were cancelled 
in the case of the president and coo we settled outstanding expenses of  and cancelled  stock options 
we also incurred in the second quarter of expenses of  relating to the write off of expense advances for former employees 
legal costs of  relating primarily to the settlements of disputes arising from commitments made by former management to lenders  together with disputes with former employees and consultants and  to a lesser extent  the april financing arrangements  were incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters of o in we recognized a charge to stock compensation expense of  as compared to  in the expense is reconciled as follows stock compensation expense  for employee based stock option plans in accordance with accounting principle board opinion no 
apb and  for non employee based stock option plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no fas and reversal of previously recorded stock compensation expense on the cancellation of non vested options of  o offsetting the net savings mentioned above were provisions for doubtful debts of  the increase of  in compared to was primarily due to o the full year effect of retaining a public relations company in the second half of to focus on investor relations and development status of the invicorp tm and kinetin products  and o the full year effect of retaining a consulting company in the second half of to focus on product licensing opportunities for invicorp tm with potential pharmaceutical partners and the setting up of raw material supply and contract manufacturing arrangements for invicorp tm supply chain 
we recognized  of employee stock compensation expense in accordance with apb and fas in fiscal compared to  of employee stock compensation expense in fiscal skincare division general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the costs reflect stock compensation expense relating to the grant of employee stock options in  which vest in  and beyond  in accordance with apb the increase of  in compared to was mainly due to costs incurred in relation to the new license and supply arrangements and provision for bad debts 
the decrease of  in compared to was primarily due to decreased operating costs of ccsi following the outsourcing of manufacturing in marketing and promotion pharmaceutical division marketing and promotion expenses totaled  for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the  decrease in compared to is mainly due to the elimination of external consulting arrangements and non essential advertising expenditure 
the  decrease in compared to was mainly due to a reduction in corporate advertising and marketing communication costs in relation to the invicorp tm and reliaject tm developments 
skincare division marketing and promotion expenses totaled  for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to was mainly due to the implementation of a focused marketing plan  which resulted in all the skincare product lines coming under third party licensing arrangements 
the decrease of  in compared to was mainly due to one time advertising costs associated with the promotion of kinetin products in selling expenses skincare division selling expenses relating to our skincare products totaled nil for  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
no field selling expenses have been recorded during this is due to the establishment of licensing and distribution arrangements in the skincare sector and the elimination of direct selling activities 
the decrease of  in compared to was primarily due to reduced salaries and broker commissions following the streamlining of the product portfolio in impairment costs in december  the company abandoned certain fixed assets 
as a result of this abandonment  the company recorded an impairment loss of  the assets written down comprised of assets in progress associated with the reliaject development and computers and office equipment 
the pharmaceutical and skincare business segments were written down by  and  respectively 
other income and expense in april  the company received  net of  in expenses in cash and refinanced the balance owed of  under a credit agreement  in exchange for two new notes that currently bear interest at per annum and mature in april the notes require semi annual payment of interest only until maturity and are secured by all of the company s assets 
interest may be paid in cash or in ordinary shares that have been registered with the sec 
the company issued series a warrants to purchase an aggregate of  ordinary shares at per share  which were adjusted down to in accordance with certain terms of the agreement under which they were issued 
the series a warrants expire five years from the date of issuance 
series b and c warrants to purchase approximately million and million ordinary shares at and per share were issued in connection with the company s settlement and refinancing agreements are only exercisable to the extent the outstanding principal balance of  is not repaid in cash 
the series b and c warrants expire ten years from the date of issuance 
the fair value of  of the series a warrants and all of the series b warrants was determined to be million using the black scholes model 
the fair value of these warrants will be amortized over the life of the new notes because such warrants  under the terms of the financing agreement  were issued in connection with the million new financing 
on the other hand  the million fair value of the remaining  series a warrants and all of the  series c warrants was included in the loss on extinguishment of debt discussed below because these warrants were issued to refinance existing debt under the terms of the april financing agreement 
the amortization of the deferred finance costs on the million new financing amounted to  for the year 
as the outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement were refinanced by notes with substantially different terms as defined by eitf  debtors accounting for a modification or extinguishment of debt instruments  eitf  the company is required to recognize the difference between the fair value of the new notes issued to refinance the old debt and the carrying value of the old debt net of unamoritized issuance costs as a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
during  the company recognized a  loss on the extinguishment of debt 
also  in april the company entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the terms of various transactions that had been entered into by the previous management of the company 
the settlement terms required the issuance of  series a warrants and  new ordinary shares 
accordingly the company recorded  of expense in the second quarter of related to the settlement terms 
included in the  settlement expense is the fair value of the  ordinary shares issued in also  included in other expense is  of external interest expense on the company s investment notes 
refer to note to the financial statements for discussion of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by  during to  this increase is due to the excess of the proceeds of private placements of shares  convertible debt  the exercise of warrants and the exercise of employee share options for the year over our operational losses  capital expenditure and net movements in working capital 
to date we have realized only modest revenues from our operations 
we continue  as in the past  to depend upon raising equity funds from private placements 
our independent auditors report on our consolidated financial statements included in item states that senetek 
has negative working capital and has suffered recurring losses from its pharmaceutical operations and its ability to continue research activities to a stage where it has a product available for sale is dependent upon securing additional sources of financing 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about 
senetek s 
ability to continue as a going concern 
in april  we issued  in aggregate principal amount of secured promissory notes 
the notes currently bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually  and are due and payable in full in april the repayment of the notes is secured by all of the assets of senetek plc and its subsidiaries 
in exchange for the issuance of the notes  we received  in cash less expenses and refinancing of  of our previously outstanding debt 
we also issued warrants to purchase ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the notes 
although we have received no commitment for the advance of any further funds  other lenders who advance up to an additional  may share in the collateral securing the notes described above on pari passu basis with the existing note holders 
our other most significant revenue commitments are our research agreements  consulting agreements  employment agreements and property leases 
in the event of the use of kinetin as a prescription product  as opposed to a cosmeceutical product  we would have to commit considerable additional expenditure  and the speed at which this work can be undertaken will depend upon our financial resources 
we anticipate spending approximately million during on the development of our pharmaceutical and skincare products  including new auto injector projects  and on our administrative and marketing operations 
our management is of the opinion that although we will generate increased revenues from the sale of our skincare product lines  monoclonal antibodies and the invicorp tm product to named patients  these will not be sufficient to meet our short term financial requirements 
additionally  certain holders of a substantial number of warrants may exercise their right to convert their warrants into shares upon payment to us of the exercise price as the conversion dates approach 
our management is discussing the possibility of entering into licensing arrangements with several major pharmaceutical companies 
although these discussions may lead to a license agreement of a substantial nature in due course  we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing such an agreements 
government policy it is the opinion of our board of directors that there are no aspects of government policy which  as far as can be foreseen  are likely to have a material effect on the conduct of our business  except as generally described in part i  item  of this form k under the heading government regulation 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on the results of our operations to date 
year the term year issue is used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculation by computers and other machinery as the year approaches 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from those in the s 
this could result in system failure of miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in we had initiated a year assessment and remediation program 
as part of this program  we have completed an evaluation of our computer systems and significant software programs  including our network hardware and operating systems and accounting and business process software and our non information technology systems 
we also confirmed with our major vendors that they were year compliant 
our new accounting and business software was purchased with the year in mind 
this software was year compliant when purchased 
as a result of our review of all other software and hardware  we made an upgrade to our information software and no changes to our hardware 
the testing and evaluation process was completed in the fourth quarter of as of  january  through march   we have not experienced any hardware or software problems related to the millennium date change 
we do not anticipate any significant latent software or hardware problems  but we have retained the company that performed our testing and evaluation an annual maintenance contract 
foreign currencies we have operations in the united kingdon  where the functional currency is the pound sterling 
the company follows currency translation principles established by sfas no 
all assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of the uk operation are translated at period end exchange rates 
all income and expenditure items in the profit and loss account of the uk operation are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
translation gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of the uk operation are not included in determining net income but are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they occur 
we do not use any methods to hedge the effect of changes in the pound sterling exchange rate 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as hedge  the object of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk  or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  historically  we have not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
certain factors that may affect future operating results we have a history of losses 
although we were formed almost years ago in october  and are now close to realizing our commercial objectives  our business is subject to the risks inherent in the establishment of a relatively new business enterprise in the field of biopharmaceuticals 
the likelihood of the success of our business must be considered in the light of the problems  expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new products and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we are operating 
since inception  we have only produced  in gross revenues and have had cumulative losses of  including a net loss of  in fiscal 
as a result our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their report that these losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
although certain of our biopharmaceutical products may be marketed in the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurance that marketing will begin when we anticipate  if at all  or that revenues from our other products  including kinetin  will rise to a level that will allow us to operate profitably during the fiscal year ending december  our operating results may fluctuate significantly  and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price  causing investor losses 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
in particular  research and development and general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
due to fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that case  our stock price could fluctuate significantly or decline 
we may need additional financing in order to continue our operations 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient equity  cash flow or bank facilities to continue our operations during fiscal  in the event that we are unable to obtain further funding  or the costs of development and operations prove greater than anticipated  we may be required to further curtail our operations or seek alternative financing arrangements 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient funds or are unable to raise additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or cease certain of our programs 
this would materially and adversely affect our business 
we may be unable to develop commercially successful products 
our product launches to date have generated limited revenues 
we have a variety of product candidates in various stages of development and will undertake substantial additional research and development and pre clinical and clinical testing of our products 
these efforts may not result in the development of any commercially successful products 
some of our potential products are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of new biopharmaceutical products including the risks that o a product candidate fails in pre clinical studies  o a potential product is not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  o we fail to obtain regulatory approval for the product  o we fail to produce a product in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost  and o a product does not gain market acceptance 
future financings may result in the substantial dilution of shareholders interests and may result in future investors being granted rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
continued research and development efforts are required or our products may be rendered obsolete by other technological developments 
we are engaged in a field characterized by extensive research efforts 
despite our current access to leading expertise in the field  there remains a risk that the research financed by us in the future could prove unproductive 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that research and discoveries by other companies will not render our programs superfluous or obsolete 
this is true for all companies who operate in the same field 
competition in our industry is intense  and an inability to compete successfully may harm our business 
the biopharmaceutical  pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries are highly competitive 
our business and research efforts compete with drug discovery programs at biotechnology  drug delivery  biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies  as well as with internal drug discovery efforts of pharmaceutical companies acting independently or in collaboration with other companies 
in addition  academic institutions  government agencies throughout the world and public and private organizations conducting research may seek intellectual property protection  discover competing products  or establish collaborative arrangements in our area of research and development 
we face exposure to liability for our products 
during recent years  lawsuits resulting in very substantial liability have been filed against companies engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and other medical related products or devices which have subsequently proved harmful to human health 
many of these cases have exposed companies to liability long after the products have been brought to market  even though  at the time of their development  based on extensive research  there were no perceived risks of injury 
thus  notwithstanding united states food and drug administration fda or other foreign governmental approval  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to liability from the use of our products 
there is no assurance that product liability coverage will be adequate to protect against future claims 
management intends to have third parties manufacture and distribute certain of our products and believes that our exposure to liability will thereby be lessened 
however  there can be no assurance that this result will be achieved 
we rely on certain key suppliers in order to produce our products 
we contract out manufacture of all of our products and purchase raw materials from third party suppliers 
we recently established a dual supply chain for kinetin 
although we believe that other suppliers are available who can produce similar materials and products  there can be no assurance that such materials would be available to us on an immediate basis if needed  or at prices similar to those now paid by us 
we face product liability risks of cosmetics 
we are subject to the risk of product liability claims related to the use of our products which are designed for application to human hair and skin 
we carry product liability insurance which management believes will be adequate to cover risks associated with such use  however  there can be no assurance that existing or future insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any possible product liability risks or that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically feasible terms 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  we would be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology  which could impair our ability to compete in the market  and the cost of enforcing our proprietary rights may be expensive and result in increased losses 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products  both in the united states and in other countries  and our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
we rely on our issued and pending patent applications in the united states and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that any of the currently pending or future patent applications will issue as patents  or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
further  we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information or that adequate remedies would exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
the exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
further  we cannot assure you that others have not or will not independently develop substantially equivalent know how and technology 
our commercial success also depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents or proprietary rights and the breach of any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of several third party patents that may relate to our technology 
we believe that we do not infringe these patents but cannot assure you that we will not be found in the future to infringe these or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties  either with products we are currently developing or with new products that we may seek to develop in the future 
if third parties assert infringement claims against us  we may be forced to enter into license arrangements with them 
we cannot assure you that we could enter into the required licenses on commercially reasonably terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or to implement alternative approaches may prevent us from commercializing products under development and would impair our ability to be commercially competitive 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  uspto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings will result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
further  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised during the discovery process of any litigation 
during the course of any lawsuit  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
regulation by government agencies imposes significant costs and restrictions on our business activities 
the production and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated 
our ability and the ability of our partners to secure regulatory approval for our products and to continue to satisfy regulatory requirements will determine our future success 
we may not receive required regulatory approvals for our products or receive approvals in a timely manner 
in particular  fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries  including the european medicines evaluation agency and the medicine control agency mca in the uk  must approve human therapeutic and preventive products before they are marketed 
this approval process can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
while the time required to obtain approval varies  it can take several years 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of products and our ability to receive product revenues or royalties 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary approvals for clinical testing or for the manufacturing and marketing of any products that we develop 
we are also subject to ongoing regulatory review 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility or other violations of regulatory requirements may result in o fines  o suspensions of regulatory approvals  o product recalls  and o criminal prosecution 
the failure to obtain regulatory approvals  the restriction  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements or changes in the regulatory framework could materially and adversely affect our business 
for further discussion of regulations and potential penalties  see business government regulation 
professional guidelines could adversely affect our business 
private health organizations and science foundations may publish recommendations for treatments  which affect various therapies  drugs or procedures  including any products we might develop 
these recommendations may relate to o usage  o dosage  o method of administration  and o use of other therapies simultaneously 
if patients and health care providers follow recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use of our products  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the price of our ordinary shares is volatile 
the market price of our ordinary shares  like that of other biotechnology companies  has fluctuated significantly 
factors that could cause the combined company s stock price to fluctuate in the future may include o announcements by us or our competitors of clinical trial results and other product developments  o adverse developments in the protection of intellectual property or other legal matters  o announcements in the scientific and research community or by other biotechnology companies  o regulatory changes that affect our products  o fluctuations in our operating results  and o changes in third party reimbursement policies or in medical practices 
third party reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives may constrain our future revenues 
our ability to successfully market any product we develop  and particularly with respect to our invicorp tm product  will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our products and related treatments 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope 
third party payers may not reimburse patients for newly approved health care products such as those that we are developing 
increasingly  third party payers are attempting to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including o challenging the prices charged for health care products  o limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products  o denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered experimental or investigational by third party payers  and o refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance the testing  marketing and sale of our products involve significant product liability risks 
we may be held liable for damages for product failures or adverse reactions resulting from the use of our products 
this liability could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we maintain product liability insurance  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims 
furthermore  in the future  we may not be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms and any insurance we do obtain may not provide adequate coverage against any asserted claims 
united states judgments may not be enforceable against us 
judgments of united states courts  including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states  may not be enforceable in english courts 
as a result  stockholders who obtain a judgment against senetek in the united states may not be able to require senetek to pay the amount of the judgment 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows as we have limited risks related to interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations
