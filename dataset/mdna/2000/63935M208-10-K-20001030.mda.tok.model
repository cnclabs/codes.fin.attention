before this date  our corporate headquarters were shared with cmgi and several other cmgi affiliates 
cmgi allocated rent  facility maintenance and service costs among these affiliates based upon headcount within each affiliate and within each department of each affiliate 
other services provided by cmgi to us included support for enterprise services  human resources and benefits and internet marketing and business development 
actual expenses could have varied had we been operating on a stand alone basis

our contracts generally are a one to three year commitment 
our revenue from sales to related parties principally consists of sales of services to cmgi and other customers that are cmgi affiliates 
in general  in pricing the services provided to cmgi and its affiliates  we have negotiated the services and levels of service to be provided  calculated the price of the services at those service levels based on our then current  standard prices  and  in exchange for customer referrals provided to us by cmgi  discounted these prices by 
in fiscal  we sold services to cmgi and cmgi affiliates totaling approximately million  or of revenue 
three of these customers accounted for approximately  and of revenue  respectively

cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits for operations personnel  bandwidth fees and related internet connectivity charges  equipment costs and related depreciation and costs to run our four data centers  such as rent and utilities

we also expect to achieve economies of scale as a result of spreading more volume over fixed assets  increasing productivity and using new technological tools 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  commissions and marketing expenses such as advertising  product literature  trade shows  marketing and direct mail programs 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in dollar terms  but decline on a percentage of revenue basis  as we continue to invest in these areas to promote brand recognition and to acquire new customers 
we intend to accomplish this by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  opening additional sales offices and increasing spending on public relations  advertising and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of financial  leasing  human resources  it and administrative personnel  professional services and corporate overhead 
also included are intercompany charges from cmgi for facilities prior to our move to our new headquarters in january  human resource support and business development

our product development staff focuses on internet applications and network architecture

as with sales and marketing  we believe that increased investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and maintaining our competitive edge 
we expect the dollar value of product development expenses to increase significantly in future periods  but decline on a percentage of revenue basis 
we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and  as of july   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses primarily have been funded by cmgi through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and convertible debt  our initial public offering and related underwriters over allotment in october and november  respectively  and the sale leaseback of certain assets 
we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales  marketing  promotion  technology and infrastructure development as we grow 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations for at least the next fiscal year and that the rate at which such losses will be incurred may increase

customer and other receipts were remitted to cmgi and applied to reduce our obligations to cmgi 
we issued a secured convertible demand note to cmgi in exchange for the cancellation of all outstanding intercompany debt incurred by us to cmgi prior to april  this note also provided for additional advances by cmgi to us after april  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  the amount of each borrowing represented by the note was convertible from time to time into the number of shares of series b convertible preferred stock equal to one tenth of the quotient of the aggregate amount of principal and interest to be so converted  divided by the applicable conversion price for that fiscal quarter 
the conversion price applicable to advances made during the fiscal quarter in which our initial public offering occurred was determined by the offering price of the initial public offering 
under this note  cmgi converted intercompany debt in the aggregate amount of approximately million  representing funds advanced during the period subsequent to july  through october  the effective date of the registration statement relating to our initial public offering  into  shares of series b convertible preferred stock based upon a conversion price of  ten times the initial public offering price of per share 
upon the closing of our initial public offering  each issued and outstanding share of series b convertible preferred stock converted into shares of common stock  or  shares of common stock in the aggregate 
on june   we sold  shares of our common stock to cmgi for the sum of million  in a private placement transaction 
the number of shares was determined by dividing million by the average of the closing prices per share of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system on june    and   rounded up to the nearest whole share 
in june  we sold certain of our equipment and leasehold improvements in our two new data centers in a sale leaseback transaction to a bank for approximately million 
we entered into a capital lease the capital lease upon the leaseback of those assets 
the capital lease bears interest at a nominal rate of and an effective interest rate of and is payable in monthly installments ending june the capital lease contains a mandatory balloon payment  for repurchase by us  equal to of the bank s acquisition cost of the equipment 
the capital lease also contains certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of million of cash or cash equivalents and the maintenance of not less than billion of market capitalization 
we were in compliance with such covenants as of july  however  as of october   we were no longer in compliance with the market capitalization covenant 
this constitutes a breach of the market capitalization covenant and  if  due to that  the lessor chooses to notify us of a default and the market capitalization does not return to at least billion within ten days of our receipt of such a notice  then the million obligation classified as a non current liability as of july   would be immediately payable 
we are currently negotiating with the lessor to obtain a waiver of the market capitalization covenant 
should we fail to obtain a waiver or other modification  the lessor has the right to terminate the lease and require that all amounts outstanding under the lease become immediately due and payable 
while we are seeking to cure the covenant violation within the allotted time period  or obtain satisfactory waivers and or modification of the necessary lease covenants  failure to cure such violations or obtain waivers or modifications could have a material impact on our financial position and liquidity 
subsequent to july   cmgi committed to advance us  if needed by july   million for working capital and an additional million to cover any amounts that may come due and payable under our capital lease arrangement in the event of default under the lease covenants  subject to negotiation of a mutually acceptable vehicle and related terms and conditions and approval of both companies respective board of directors 
we have experienced a substantial increase in our expenditures since inception consistent with our growth in operations and staffing 
we anticipate that expenditures will continue to increase as we grow our business 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities in businesses that management believes will complement our technologies and market strategies 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources at july  combined with the cash to be received from cmgi  as described above and our ability to obtain additional lease financing credit lines  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs  barring unforeseen circumstances  for working capital and capital expenditures over the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  to fund our domestic and international expansion  to develop new  or enhance existing  services or products  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  on a long term basis  we may require additional external financing for working capital and capital expenditures through credit facilities  sales of additional equity or other financing vehicles 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience additional dilution 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents 
we invest our cash primarily in money market funds 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on capital lease obligations due to the fixed nature of such obligations 
we do not currently have any foreign operations and thus are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
