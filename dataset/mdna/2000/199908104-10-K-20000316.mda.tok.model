two of the pooled companies are considered immaterial poolings based upon criteria set forth by the securities and exchange commission and have not been restated for all periods presented 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results of the company because  among other things  the acquired companies were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
the results of the company have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the timing and magnitude of acquisitions  assimilation costs and the seasonal nature of the hvac industry may materially affect operating results

in july  the company entered into a credit agreement with bank one  texas  na the credit facility 
the credit facility was amended and restated in september primarily to provide for additional banks to lend to the company under the credit facility 
at that time  the credit facility provided the company with an unsecured revolving line of credit of million 
the credit facility was further amended in april and again in december in order to increase borrowing capacity and to provide for additional banks to lend to the company under the credit facility 
the credit facility currently provides the company with a revolving line of credit of up to million secured by accounts receivable  inventory and the shares of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the company currently has a choice of two interest rate options when borrowing under the credit facility 
under one option  the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the bank s prime rate 
an additional margin of zero to is then added to the higher of these two rates 
under the other interest rate option  borrowings bear interest based on designated short term eurodollar rates which generally approximate libor plus to 
the additional margin for both options depends on the ratio of the company s debt to ebitda

the credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends by the company without the lenders approval and requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants

subsequent to yearend  the company has purchased approximately million additional shares at a cost of approximately million through march the company anticipates that available borrowings under its credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s normal working capital and capital expenditure needs  debt service requirements and additional acquisition opportunities 
should the company accelerate or revise its acquisition program  the company may need to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities or increase its credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will secure such financing if and when it is needed  or that such financing will be available on terms that the company deems acceptable 
year computers  software  and other equipment utilizing embedded technology that use only two digits to identify a year in a date field may be unable to accurately process certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company implemented a year program and used both internal and external resources to assess and replace or reprogram computers  software and other equipment as needed 
key areas of the company s operations that were addressed included external customers  external suppliers and internal computers  software and potential back up and contingency plans 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant year issues 
the company s initial assessment identified year issues within the company s operating systems 
the total cost of year enhancements was approximately  and was funded from operating cash flows 
the majority of such costs was for the acquisition of hardware and software and were capitalized 
the remaining costs were expensed as incurred and did not have a material effect on the results of operations 
the ability of third parties with which the company transacts business to adequately address remaining year issues is outside of the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the failure of the company  or such third parties  to adequately address their respective remaining year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
accordingly  as part of the year program  contingency plans were developed to respond to any failures 
at this time  the company does not expect that any failure of the company or third parties to achieve year compliance will adversely affect the company 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  the company expects its revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  the company s volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
factors which may affect future results the company s future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating acquired businesses  a downturn in construction  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems  the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed price contract  difficulties in implementing its acquisition strategy and the availability of acquisition financing 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to integrate the companies it has acquired 
the businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results of the company because  among other things  the acquired companies were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
key elements of the company s strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability of the individual businesses and to continue to expand the revenues of such businesses 
the company s level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside the company s control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for the company s services 
the company has grown significantly through the acquisition of additional hvac and complementary businesses and intends to continue acquisition activity in the future  albeit more opportunistically 
however  the company could face difficulties in continuing to acquire select companies 
the hvac industry continues to undergo consolidation on both a national and a regional level by the company and by other companies that have acquisition objectives that are similar to the company s objectives 
additionally  hvac equipment manufacturers and certain public utilities are beginning to provide maintenance  repair and replacement services within the hvac industry 
these companies generally are better capitalized  have greater name recognition and may be able to provide these services at a lower cost 
recently acquired businesses also involve a number of special risks  including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results  diversion of management s attention and failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to their acquisition 
any of these risks  or a combination of them  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems by the company requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
in addition  the company depends on the senior management of the businesses it acquires and regional and corporate management to remain committed to the success of the company 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain and increase its productivity and profitability is also affected by its ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet the company s service requirements  and to retain senior management in acquired businesses and at the corporate and regional level 
hvac systems are also subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which the company operates will not change significantly in the future 
the company s failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the company s future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  the increasing supply of tradable stock  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events
