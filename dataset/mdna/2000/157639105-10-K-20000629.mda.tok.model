each of these factors  and other risks pertaining to the company  the premium wine industry and general business and economic conditions  are more fully discussed herein and from time to time in other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
change in fiscal year end effective with the fiscal year ending march   the company changed its fiscal year from one ending on december to one ending on march accordingly  the company reported a three month transition period ending march results of operations the following table represents financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the indicated periods year ended march  net revenues gross profit revenues from other operations  net selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense settlement income equity in net income of duhart milon minority interest net income loss wine sales net revenues for the year ended march  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was attributable to a volume increase of and a average price increase 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased million or over the prior year comparable period 
this increase was attributable to a volume increase of and a average price increase 
sales volume in the california market comprised and of the company s total sales for the year ended march  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was primarily the result of increased sales volume and increased average sales prices 
gross profit for the year ended march  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was primarily the result of increased sales volume and average sales prices  as well as  less pronounced increases in average production costs partly due to the relative success and size of the harvest 
revenue from other operations  net revenue from other operations  primarily consists of revenue obtained from third party wineries  net of related expenses  for grape crushing or wine bottling and net profit from sales of bulk wine 
this aspect of the company s operation is not significant although the company cannot predict the materiality of such operations in the future  as this source of revenue is highly unpredictable and largely contingent on other wineries demand for extra production capacity  which can and does vary significantly from year to year 
such revenue for the year ended march  decreased  from the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was attributable to less custom crush demand 
such revenue for the year end march  decreased  from the comparable period in the preceding year which was attributable to less custom crush demand driven in part by the relatively lower harvest tonnage throughout california as compared to the harvest tonnage  partly offset by increased custom bottling demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase is primarily the result of i increased selling and marketing expenditures normally associated with increased sales quantities and  ii expenditures in the company s infrastructure 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase is primarily the result of i increased selling and marketing expenditures normally associated with increased sales quantities and also related to the launching of the new echelon brand name  ii expenditures in the company s infrastructure and iii unusually high severance costs 
operating income operating income remained substantially the same for the years ended march  and although gross profits increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  this increase was offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and lower revenues from other operations as discussed above 
operating income for the year ended march  increased  or over the prior comparable year despite reduced revenue from other operations as noted above 
this increase was primarily due to higher gross profits  offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  other revenues from operations decreased to  or of operating income as compared to  or for the year ended march  interest expense for the year ended march  interest expense increased by  or as compared with the prior year 
this was a result of increased borrowings primarily to fund acquisitions that took place in the fiscal year 
also  the company borrowed million to pay holders of subordinated debentures that matured during the year 
interest expense decreased  or between the years ending march  and which primarily was driven by lower interest rates 
settlement income for the year ended march   the company recognized million of non recurring gain arising from the final settlement of litigation related to the july fire damage at the carmenet winery 
equity in net income of duhart milon the company s equity interest in the net income of duhart milon for the years ending march    and were  and  and  respectively 
these results were materially the same for and and the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to exceptionally high demand for the vintage of bordeaux wines 
the company monitors its investment in duhart milon primarily through its on going communication with domaines barons de rothschild dbr 
such communication is facilitated by the presence of the company s chairman on dbr s board of directors  and dbr s representation on the company s board of directors 
additionally  various key employees of the company make periodic visits to duhart milon s offices and productions facilities 
since the investment in duhart milon is a long term investment denominated in a foreign currency  the company records the gain or loss for currency translation in other comprehensive income or loss  which is part of shareholders equity 
the amount recorded was increased to million from million for the year ended march  as compared to the prior year due to the decrease in the relative worth of the french franc when compared to the us dollar during the period 
although the transition to the euro currency became effective as of january   the company does not anticipate that this transition will have a material impact on its investment in duhart milon minority interest the minority interest in the net income of edna valley vineyard evv and canoe ridge vineyard  llc crv for the three years ended march  consisted of the following in thousands year ended march minority venture minority owner percent edna valley vineyard paragon vineyard co  inc canoe ridge vineyard  llc various the minority interest in earnings for the year ended march  increased  or over the comparable period ended march   due to steadily improving performance at both evv and crv primarily as a result of increases in both case sales and gross margins per case 
the minority interest in earnings for the year ended march  increased  or from the prior comparable period due to improved performance at both evv and crv 
company management believes that evv and  to a lesser degree crv  will both continue to contribute significantly to the company s consolidated income statement 
net income net income for the year ended march  was million  a decrease of million  or  over the year ended march  this was primarily as a result of the non recurring gain of million after tax effect recorded in  higher selling  general and administrative expenses and increased interest expense 
net income for the year ended march  was million  an increase of million as compared to the year ended march  excluding the effects of the non recurring gain as discussed above  net income increased principally due to higher gross profits offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
seasonality the company s wine sales from quarter to quarter are highly variable due to  among other things  the timing of the release of wines for sale and changes in consumer demand 
sales are typically strongest during the fourth quarter because of heavy holiday sales and because most wines generally are released between the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarters 
liquidity and capital resources working capital working capital as of march  was million  compared to million at march  the million decrease was primarily attributable to an increase of million in borrowing under the revolving bank loan agreement and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in deferred income taxes and income tax receivable of million 
borrowings under the company s credit lines totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the company had no cash balances as of march  compared to million at march  the company has historically financed its growth through increases in borrowings and cash flow from operations 
in addition  the company received million of proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to previously issued common stock warrants 
during fiscal  the company s primary uses of its capital have been to finance a million increase in property  plant and equipment including vineyard development and the acquisition of sagelands winery and a million increase in inventory 
management expects that the company s working capital needs will grow significantly to support expected future growth in sales volume 
due to the lengthy aging and processing cycles involved in premium wine production  expenditures for inventory and fixed assets need to be made one to three years or more in advance of anticipated sales 
the company currently expects its operating and capital spending requirements will total approximately million for the year ending march  the company expects to finance these future capital needs through operations  security offerings  and additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to the company 
borrowing arrangements on march   the company entered into a credit agreement with cooperative centrale raiffeisen boerenleenbank ba  rabobank nederland  new york branch rabobank 
the rabobank credit facility provides for a total of million of unsecured financing  consisting of a seven year  million term loan and a two year  million revolving loan facility 
as of march   the company had million available under the revolving loan facility and has utilized the entire term loan 
disclosures about market risk you should read the following disclosures in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which have been drafted in compliance with regulations of the sec concerning the use of plain english 
these disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the company s business as they appear to management at this time 
however  this list is not exhaustive 
other risks may  and likely will  arise from time to time 
our revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that we will maintain our current profitability in the future 
significant factors in these quarterly fluctuations  none of which are within our control  are changes in consumer demand for our wines  the affect of weather and other natural forces on growing conditions and  in turn  the quality and quantity of grapes produced by us  interest rates and other business and economic conditions 
additionally  our sales volume tends to be affected by price increases  distributors inventory levels and the timing of releases for certain wines  among other factors 
consequently  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
a large portion of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
in quarters when revenues do not meet our expectations  our level of fixed expenses tends to exacerbate the adverse effect on net income 
in quarters when our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
our business is seasonal our business is subject to seasonal as well as quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
our sales volume tends to increase during the summer months and the holiday season and decrease after the holiday season 
as a result  our sales and earnings are typically highest during the fourth calendar quarter and lowest in the first calendar quarter 
seasonal factors also affect our level of borrowing 
for example  our borrowing levels typically are highest during winter when we have to pay for harvest costs and may have to make contractual payments to grape growers 
these and other factors may cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our profits depend largely on sales in certain states and on sales of certain varietals in the twelve months ended march   approximately of our wine sales were concentrated in states 
changes in national consumer spending or consumer spending in these states and other regions of the country could affect both the quantity and price level of wines that customers are willing to purchase 
approximately of our net revenues in the twelve months ended march  were concentrated in our top four selling varietal wines 
specifically  sales of chardonnay  pinot noir  cabernet sauvignon and merlot accounted for   and of our net revenues  respectively 
competition may harm our business the premium table wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
our wines compete in all of the premium wine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines  with imported wines coming primarily from the burgundy and bordeaux regions of france and  to a lesser extent  italy  chile  argentina  south africa and australia 
our wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and  to a lesser degree  non alcoholic beverages  for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by our independent distributors  many of which carry extensive brand portfolios 
the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
our sales may be harmed to the extent we are not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers 
bad weather  pests and plant diseases could harm our business winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
various diseases and pests and extreme weather conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to us 
this could reduce the quality or amount of wine we produce 
a deterioration in the quality of our wines could harm our brand name  and a decrease in our production could reduce our sales and profits 
future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and or reduce production 
grape growing requires adequate water supplies 
we generally supply our vineyards water needs through wells and reservoirs located on our properties 
we believe that we either have  or are currently planning to insure adequate water supplies to meet the needs of all of our vineyards 
however  a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines 
many california vineyards  including vineyards in northern california  have been infested with phylloxera  a root louse that renders a vine economically unproductive within a few years after infestation 
the current strain of phylloxera primarily affects vines of a certain type 
our vineyard properties are primarily planted to rootstocks believed to be resistant to phylloxera 
however  we cannot be certain that our existing vineyards or the rootstocks we are now using in our planting and replanting programs will not in the future become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera  plant insects or diseases  any of which could harm our business 
it is also possible that the vineyards could be infested by new strains of phylloxera  insects  fungi  viruses or similar perils 
for example  a new strain of the sharpshooter glassy winged  a flying insect that is believed to carry pierces disease and can kill vines with which it comes into contact  recently was discovered in southern california and is believed to be migrating north 
the weather phenomenon commonly referred to as el nino produced heavy rains and cooler weather during the spring of and  which resulted in colder and wetter soils than are typical during california s grape growing season 
consequently  the and harvest was postponed by approximately four to six weeks depending on the geographical location and varietals 
the unusual weather conditions resulting from el nino impacted quantity and quality of the company s estate harvest 
the size of the company s most significant crops ranged from normal sized yields to of normal yields depending on the varietal and the particular estate 
despite the foregoing reduction in the yield of certain crops  the harvested estate crops  in combination with contracted grape purchases most of which are tonnage based  are expected to permit the company to meet originally anticipated sales projections for its and vintage chardonnay  cabernet and merlot varietals which  together  have historically comprised between and of its aggregate annual production 
we may not be able to grow or acquire enough quality grapes for our wines the adequacy of our grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry wide production levels 
while we believe that we can secure sufficient supplies of grapes from a combination of our own production and from grape supply contracts with independent growers  we cannot be certain that grape supply shortages will not occur 
a shortage in the supply of wine grapes could result in an increase in the price of some or all grape varieties and a corresponding increase in our wine production costs 
current trends in the domestic and foreign wine industry point to rapid plantings of new vineyards and replanting of old vineyards to greater densities  with the expected result of significantly increasing the worldwide supply of premium wine grapes and the amount of wine which will be produced in the future 
this expected increase in grape production could result in an excess of supply over demand and force wineries to reduce  or not increase  prices 
we depend on third parties to sell our wine we sell our products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets  restaurants  hotels and private clubs across the united states and in some overseas markets 
to a lesser degree  we rely on direct sales from our wineries  our wine library and direct mail 
sales to our largest distributor and to our nineteen largest distributors combined  represented approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues during the twelve months ended march  sales to our nineteen largest distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the future 
we use a single broker in order to sell our wines within california 
such sales represent of our net revenues during the twelve month period ended march  the laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors  except under certain limited circumstances  making it difficult to terminate a distributor without reasonable cause  as defined by applicable statutes 
the resulting difficulty or inability to replace distributors  poor performance of our major distributors or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major distributors could harm our business 
new regulations or increased regulatory costs could harm our business the wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the federal bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms and various foreign agencies  state liquor authorities and local authorities 
these regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements  trade and pricing practices  permitted distribution channels  permitted and required labeling  advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers 
any expansion of our existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances  environmental restrictions and other legal requirements 
in addition  new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes  income taxes  property and sales taxes or international tariffs  could reduce our profits 
future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry  either individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business 
we will need more working capital to grow the premium wine industry is a capital intensive business  which requires substantial capital expenditures to develop and acquire vineyards and to improve or expand wine production 
further  the farming of vineyards and acquisition of grapes and bulk wine require substantial amounts of working capital 
we project the need for significant capital spending and increased working capital requirements over the next several years  which must be financed by cash from operations or additional borrowings or other financing 
adverse public opinion about alcohol may harm our business a number of research studies suggest that various health benefits may result from the moderate consumption of alcohol  but other studies suggest that alcohol consumption does not have any health benefits and may in fact increase the risk of stroke  cancer and other illnesses 
if an unfavorable report on alcohol consumption gains general support  it could harm the wine industry and our business 
we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business 
if hazardous substances are discovered on  or emanate from  any of our properties  and their release presents a threat of harm to public health or the environment  we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation 
payment of such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  and others  under various insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
contamination of our wines would harm our business we are subject to certain hazards and product liability risks  such as potential contamination  through tampering or otherwise  of ingredients or products 
contamination of any of our wines could result in the need for a product recall which could significantly damage our reputation for product quality  which we believe is one of our principle competitive advantages 
we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  and others  under various general liability and product liability insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
the loss of key employees would damage our reputation and business our success depends to some degree upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
although some key employees are under employment contracts with us for specific terms  the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could harm our business and our reputation  particularly if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company 
in such an event  despite provisions in our employment contracts  which are designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets  practices or procedures by such personnel under these circumstances  the company cannot be certain that the company would be able to enforce these provisions or prevent such disclosures 
shifts in foreign exchange rates or the imposition of adverse trade regulations could harm our business we conduct some of our import and export activity for wine and packaging supplies in foreign currencies 
we purchase foreign currency on the spot market on an as needed basis and engage in limited financial hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
there is a risk that a shift in certain foreign exchange rates or the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could adversely impact the costs of these items and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could have an adverse effect on our imported wine operations 
export sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended march  and the volume of international transactions is increasing and may increase these risks in the future 
infringement of our trademarks may damage our brand names or our business our wines are branded consumer products  and we distinguish our wines from our competitors by enforcement of our trademarks 
there can be no assurance that competitors will refrain from infringing our marks or using trademarks  tradenames or trade dress which dilute our intellectual property rights  and any such actions may require us to become involved in litigation to protect these rights 
litigation of this nature can be very expensive and tends to divert management s time and attention 
our acquisitions and potential future acquisitions involve a number of risks our acquisition of staton hills winery renamed sagelands winery and the possible construction of a new winery on the suscol ranch property we recently acquired and potential future acquisitions involve risks which include assimilating these operations into our company  integrating  retaining and motivating key personnel  integrating and managing geographically dispersed operations because staton hills is in washington state and our company is headquartered in california  integrating the technology and infrastructures of disparate entities  risks inherent in the production of wine in  and marketing of wine from  washington state  and the replanting of existing vineyards from white wine grapes to red wine grapes 
we relied on debt financing to purchase hewitt ranch  suscol ranch  staton hills winery  the jade mountain brand and other vineyard land and related assets during the fiscal year ended march  consequently our debt to equity ratio is high in relation to our historical standards 
the interest costs associated with this debt will increase our operating expenses and the risk of negative cash flow 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates all of the foregoing risks  among others not known or mentioned in this report  may have a significant effect on the market price of our shares 
stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in recent months and years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the specific company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our shares
