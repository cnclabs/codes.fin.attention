overview the basis of presentation includes management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the combined and separate registrants under the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
management of the companies believes that the combined presentation is most beneficial to the reader 
however  it should be noted that combined results of operations for the year ended december  are principally related to the activity of realty  as operating commenced operations on october  on november   meditrust  a massachusetts business trust meditrust s predecessor merged with santa anita realty enterprises  inc  with santa anita realty enterprises  inc as the surviving corporation  and meditrust acquisition company merged with santa anita operating company  with santa anita operating company as the surviving corporation hereafter referred to as the santa anita merger or santa anita mergers 
upon completion of the santa anita mergers  santa anita realty enterprises  inc changed its corporate name to meditrust corporation and santa anita operating company changed its corporate name to meditrust operating company 
the santa anita mergers were accounted for as reverse acquisitions whereby meditrust s predecessor and meditrust acquisition company were treated as the acquirers for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the financial history is that of meditrust s predecessor and meditrust acquisition company prior to the santa anita mergers 
after completing the santa anita merger  the companies began pursuing a strategy of diversifying into additional new businesses 
implementation of this strategy included the evaluation of numerous potential acquisition targets 
on january  and january   realty entered into definitive merger agreements for la quinta inns  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries and its unincorporated partnership and joint venture collectively la quinta and the la quinta merger and cobblestone holdings  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary collectively cobblestone and the cobblestone merger  respectively 
in february  legislation was proposed which limited the ability of the companies to utilize the paired share structure 
the companies consummated the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger on may  and july   respectively 
on july   the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act was enacted 
the reform act limits the companies ability to grow through use of the paired share structure 
while the companies use of the paired share structure in connection with the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger was grandfathered under the reform act  the ability to use the paired share structure to acquire additional real estate and operating businesses conducted with the real estate assets including the golf and lodging industries was substantially limited 
in addition  during the summer of  the debt and equity capital markets available to reits began to deteriorate  thus limiting the companies access to cost efficient capital 
comprehensive restructuring plan during the third and fourth quarters of the companies performed an analysis of the impact of the reform act  the companies limited ability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
this analysis included advice from outside professional advisors and presentations by management on the different alternatives available to the companies 
the analysis culminated in the development of a comprehensive restructuring plan the plan designed to strengthen the companies financial position and clarify its investment and operating strategy by focusing on the healthcare and lodging business segments 
the plan was announced on november  and included the following components pursue the separation of the companies primary businesses  healthcare and lodging  by creating two separately traded publicly listed reits 
the companies intended to spin off the healthcare financing business into a stand alone reit  continue to operate the companies healthcare and lodging businesses using the existing paired share reit structure until a healthcare spin off were to take place  sell more than billion of assets  including the portfolio of golf related real estate and operating properties cobblestone golf group  the santa anita racetrack and approximately million of healthcare properties  use the proceeds from these asset sales to achieve significant near term debt reduction  settle fully the companies forward equity issuance transaction feit with merrill lynch  reduce capital investments to reflect the current operating condition in each industry 
during the latter part of and throughout  the companies implemented the various parts of the plan including the sale of more than  of assets  including the cobblestone golf group  the santa anita racetrack and approximately  of healthcare properties  the repayment of more than  of debt  the full settlement of the feit  and the realignment of capital investments to respond to the current operating environment in the healthcare and lodging industries 
the companies also endeavored to separate its healthcare and lodging businesses 
however  the ability to separate these businesses was contingent upon the ability of each business to obtain a separate credit facility 
the ability to obtain separate credit facilities was hindered by the capital market s heightened uncertainty surrounding both the long term healthcare and mid priced lodging industries 
the companies boards of directors continued to evaluate the companies businesses and the capital market s response to these businesses 
as a result  the boards considered the companies alternatives and  after such consideration  adopted a reorganization plan that is no longer focused on the separation of the businesses and the spin off of the healthcare business 
as part of the plan  the companies classified golf and horseracing activities as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations are focused on the companies primary businesses  healthcare and lodging 
five point plan of reorganization during the latter part of  the companies continued to analyze and evaluate the impact of the companies continued inability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
this analysis included advice from outside professional advisors and presentations by management on the different alternatives available to the companies  and included a review of the current state of the companies investments in the healthcare industry and the long term prospects of both the healthcare and lodging industries 
a number of factors have negatively impacted the long term care and assisted living sectors of the healthcare industry 
these include the federal government s shift to a medicare prospective payment system pps in the skilled nursing industry  increased labor costs  fill up periods of longer duration for assisted living facilities  increased regulation and tighter and more costly capital markets for both healthcare operating and financing companies 
these factors have caused investment spreads to narrow and have caused a significant decline in the growth rate in the assisted living and nursing home industries 
therefore  a decision was made to reduce the companies investment in healthcare assets and focus its resources on its lodging division 
the mid priced lodging segment has experienced a greater increase in the supply of available rooms than in demand in much of the united states 
the relationship between supply and demand varies by region  however  the supply demand imbalance has been most significant in the west south central region of the united states  thus this imbalance has impacted la quinta to a greater extent than its competitors due to its concentration of hotels in this region 
although the mid priced lodging segment continues to be impacted by the supply demand imbalance  the companies believe that by focusing on internal growth and improving the efficiency of operations  the lodging division will be positioned to benefit from improving industry trends when the supply demand imbalance begins to moderate 
given the companies belief that there is long term upside potential in the mid priced lodging segment  when deemed appropriate  some of the funds generated from the healthcare divestitures and operating cash may be targeted for disciplined investment in the lodging division 
this analysis culminated in the development of a five point plan of reorganization the five point plan designed to improve the overall financial condition of the companies by substantially deleveraging its balance sheet 
the five point plan takes advantage of the companies demonstrated ability to sell healthcare assets and use the proceeds from these sales to repay debt obligations 
as part of the five point plan  the companies suspended realty s common share dividend to provide additional operating funds to repay debt and strengthen the companies balance sheet 
these actions will permit the companies  when appropriate  to make disciplined investments to position its lodging division to benefit from improving industry trends when the supply demand imbalance in its sector begins to moderate 
the five point plan was announced on january  and included the following components an orderly disposition of a significant portion of healthcare assets  suspension of realty s reit common share dividend  expectation of the declaration of the minimum dividend required to maintain reit status in december  substantial reduction in debt  and future disciplined investment in the lodging division 
the companies also announced that consistent with the adoption of the five point plan to reduce its emphasis on the healthcare division  david f 
benson would be leaving as chief executive officer  president  and treasurer of realty 
mr 
benson will continue to assist the companies on a consulting basis as the companies move forward to implement the five point plan 
william g 
byrnes  a member of the board of directors of operating  will act as chief executive officer of realty 
the boards of directors are also conducting a search for candidates with significant lodging industry experience to assume the role of chief executive officer in the reorganized companies

management expected that the remaining assets would be disposed of during as part of the review of the healthcare portfolio  management identified four properties where recent events or changes in circumstances  including physical plant and licensure issues  indicated that the carrying value of the assets may not have been recoverable 
management determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for these assets was below the carrying value and  accordingly  realty reduced the carrying value of these assets by  to estimated fair value 
management also identified one mortgage loan collateralized by a rehabilitation facility where continued eroding margins and an expiring guarantee indicated that the companies would likely not have been able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement

approximately  of the companies debt obligations are floating rate obligations in which interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movements in the london interbank offered rate libor 
the general fixed nature of the companies assets and the variable nature of a portion of the companies debt obligations creates interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the companies interest payments may increase resulting in decreases in net income and funds from operations 
to mitigate this risk the companies have entered into interest rate swaps to convert some of their floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations

it is the companies objective to match mortgage and lease terms with the terms of their borrowings 
the companies attempt to maintain an appropriate spread between their borrowing costs and the rate of return on their investments 
when development loans convert to sale leaseback transactions or permanent mortgage loans  the base rent or interest rate  as appropriate  is fixed at the time of such conversion

year ended december  operating has derived its revenue primarily from hotel operations since the consummation of the la quinta merger on july  hotel revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   or an increase of  revenue growth was primarily attributable to the increase in hotel operating revenues because there were twelve months of hotel operations in compared to the post acquisition period of july  through december  approximately  or of hotel revenues were derived from room rentals during the year ended december  compared to  and during the year ended december  hotel operating revenues generally are measured as a function of adr and occupancy 
the adr increased to in from in  an increase of 
or 
occupancy percentage decreased percentage points to in from in revpar  which is the product of occupancy percentage and adr  decreased when compared to the decrease in revpar is primarily due to a greater increase in the supply of available rooms than in demand in the west south central region of the united states 
the relationship between supply and demand varies by region and it has impacted la quinta to a greater extent than its competitors due to its concentration of hotels in the southwest 
the revenue impact of the oversupply of available rooms was somewhat mitigated by revenue increases resulting from a higher proportion of room rental income from the inn suites hotels as compared to the inns during the comparable periods 
inn suites hotels generally have higher room rental income per night then the inns 
other factors contributing to the decrease in revpar include the short term disruptive impact of the introduction of the new property management system  the reorganization of the operations and the sales organizations during the third quarter and certain pricing decisions which adversely impacted revpar

gosman received severance payments totaling  in cash and the continuation of certain life insurance benefits 
the companies established a special committee to evaluate mr 
gosman s employment contract and whether such severance or other payments were appropriate 
based on the results of the evaluation and recommendation of the special committee  the boards of directors concluded that the separation agreement was in the long term best interest of the shareholders of the companies and approved the separation agreement 
in conjunction with the implementation of the plan  which included a change in the focus of the lodging division to internal growth  la quinta management performed a review of the front desk system under development for its lodging facilities  and made a decision to abandon the project 
the decision was based primarily on management s intent to integrate the front desk system with new revenue management software  availability of more suitable and flexible externally developed software and a shift in information systems philosophy toward implementation of externally developed software and outsourcing of related support services 
a charge of approximately  to write off certain internal and external software development costs related to the project was recorded in the first quarter of operating also incurred approximately  associated with the reorganization of the lodging division including employee severance and other expenses 
discontinued operations pursuant to the plan  operating has classified golf and horseracing activities as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  operating has presented as discontinued operations approximately  of losses on disposal from the golf and horseracing segments during the year ended december  operating has recorded a loss of  related to the sale of the cobblestone golf group  which was sold on march  the loss includes a final accounting of working capital balances at the sale date 
the horseracing segment was sold on december  during the year ended december   a loss of  was recorded which related to an adjustment of the selling price between realty and operating

for the year ended december   realty has presented a loss from discontinued operations of  a gain on disposal of santa anita of  and a provision for loss on disposal of cobblestone golf group of  net loss the resulting net loss for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december  the net loss per common share for the year ended december  was 
compared to 
for the year ended december  the per common share amount decreased primarily due to other non recurring expenses incurred in  related to the separation agreement with mr 
gosman 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  operating derived its revenue primarily from hotel operations during the post acquisition period from july  through december  hotel revenues for this period were  approximately  or of hotel revenues were derived from room rentals 
hotel operating revenues generally are measured as a function of the adr and occupancy percentage 
the adr for the period july  through december  increased to as compared to adr in the second half of of  an increase of or 
occupancy percentage decreased percentage points to from for the same periods 
revpar  which is a product of the occupancy percentage and adr  increased in the post merger period over the second half of other sources of hotel revenues during the post merger period included guest services revenue of approximately  derived from charges to guests for long distance service  fax use and laundry service 
commission revenue of approximately  was earned on phone  movie and vending services 
at the merger date  la quinta operated hotels including inns and inn suites with approximately  rooms 
during the post merger period  new inn suites were opened adding over  rooms 
interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  prior to july   operating derived its revenue from horseracing and golf course operations  which are now classified as discontinued operations see below and thus are not included in revenue in or for the year ended december   total recurring expenses were  expenses were primarily attributable to hotel operating expenses  interest  rent and royalties paid to realty 
hotel operating costs of  and general and administrative expenses of  were incurred during the la quinta post merger period from july  to december  salaries  wages and related costs  represent approximately of operating expenses 
other major categories of lodging operating expense include utilities  supplies  advertising and administrative costs 
interest  royalty and rent expenses paid to realty of  were also incurred during the post merger period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  which was primarily related to depreciation of furniture and fixtures and other intangible assets acquired in the la quinta merger and a full year of amortization of goodwill  which resulted from the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in the santa anita merger 
goodwill associated with the santa anita merger primarily relates to the value of the paired share structure and  due to the permanent nature of the structure  is being amortized over a year period 
accordingly  the goodwill recorded as part of the santa anita merger is expected to remain even though the santa anita racetrack was sold in  as long as the companies continue to utilize the paired share structure 
other expenses on july   the reform act was enacted 
the reform act limits the companies ability to continue to grow through use of the paired share structure 
while the companies use of the paired share structure in connection with the cobblestone merger and the la quinta merger was grandfathered under the reform act  the ability to continue to use the paired share structure to acquire additional real estate and operating businesses conducted with the real estate assets including the golf and lodging industries was substantially limited 
in addition  during the summer of  the debt and equity capital markets available to reits began to deteriorate  thus limiting the companies access to cost efficient capital 
as a result of these events  the companies began an analysis of the impact of the reform act  the companies continued inability to access the capital markets  and the operating strategy of the companies existing businesses 
the analysis culminated in the development of the plan  which was announced on november   designed to strengthen the companies financial position and clarify its investment and operating strategy by focusing on the healthcare and lodging business segments 
other expenses  which arose from the plan  that were recorded on the books of operating for the year ended december   are as follows in thousands comprehensive restructuring plan employee severance  write off of capitalized pre development costs  total  pursuant to the plan  operating incurred approximately  of non recurring costs during these costs included the write off of certain costs associated with discontinuing lodging development of  and severance of  attributable to workforce reductions of approximately employees  primarily from operating s construction  marketing and acquisition departments 
discontinued operations during the latter part of and the first half of  the companies pursued a strategy of diversifying into new businesses including horseracing  golf and lodging 
during the third quarter of  the companies reassessed these business segments 
in addition  a review of investment and operating strategies for the companies was initiated 
as a result  during november  the companies approved the plan including the disposal of the horseracing and golf segments as well as the sale of certain healthcare and other non strategic assets 
accordingly  operating has classified approximately  of losses from the horseracing and golf segments as discontinued during the year ended december  and  of losses from the horseracing segment during the year ended december  the horseracing segment was sold on december   resulting in a net gain on disposal of  operating has also recorded a provision for loss on disposal  based upon the estimated proceeds to be realized upon sale  of the golf related assets and operations  of approximately  subsequent to the end of  the companies entered into a definitive agreement to sell cobblestone golf group for  and expected the transaction to close in early which would not result in a change in the estimated loss on disposal provided herein 
net loss the resulting net loss available for common shareholders for the year ended december   was  compared  for the year ended december  the net loss per common share for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the per common share amount decreased primarily due to the comprehensive restructuring charges  and additional common shares being issued to consummate mergers 
in connection with the cobblestone and la quinta mergers   and  additional common shares are now outstanding  respectively 
operating liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities the principal source of cash to be used to fund operating s future operating expenses and recurring capital expenditures will be cash flow provided by operating activities 
operating anticipates that cash flow provided by operating activities will provide the necessary funds on a short and long term basis to meet operating cash requirements 
cash flows from investing and financing activities operating provides funding for costs associated with the restructuring through a combination of long term and short term financing including  both debt and equity 
operating obtains long term financing through the issuance of common shares and unsecured notes 
operating obtains short term financing through borrowings from realty 
during february  the companies entered into the feit pursuant to which mli purchased shares of capital stock of the companies which were ultimately converted into paired shares 
the feit was designed to mature one year after issuance and provided mli the right to sell sufficient paired shares including the shares originally purchased to provide mli with a guaranteed return 
the feit also included a purchase price adjustment mechanism which  from time to time  resulted in the issuance of additional paired shares to mli as a result of declines in paired shares market price 
during december  the companies repurchased all of the paired shares issued pursuant to the purchase price adjustment mechanism  as well as some of the paired shares originally sold to mli 
on july   realty entered into a credit agreement which provided realty with up to  in credit facilities  replacing realty s then existing  revolving credit facilities 
the credit agreement provided for borrowings in four separate tranches tranche a  a  revolving loan  amounts of which if repaid may be reborrowed  which matures july   tranche b  a term loan in the amount of  amounts of which if repaid may not be reborrowed  which matured july  and which had a  mandatory principal payment on april   tranche c  a term loan in the amount of  amounts of which if repaid may not be reborrowed  which matured july  with a six month extension option which management exercised for a fee of basis points  and tranche d  a term loan in the amount of  amounts of which if repaid may not be reborrowed  which matures july  on november   realty amended its credit agreement to provide for realty s cash repayment of a portion of its feit to provide for the amendment of certain financial covenants to accommodate asset sales  to exclude the impact of non recurring charges in certain covenant calculations and to provide for future operating flexibility 
the amendment also provided for an increase to the libor pricing of the credit facility by approximately basis points  and the pledge of stock of the companies subsidiaries 
this pledge of subsidiary stock also extended on a pro rata basis to entitled bondholders 
realty also agreed to a basis point increase to the libor pricing in the event that an equity offering of at least  had not been completed by february  on february  this increase went into effect 
on march   realty reached a second agreement with its bank group to further amend the credit agreement 
the second amendment became effective upon the successful completion of the sale of cobblestone golf group and provided for a portion of the sale proceeds to be applied to the feit 
the second amendment also provided for  among other things  upon the sale of cobblestone golf group  elimination of limitations on certain healthcare related investments and a lowering of the commitment on the revolving tranche to  on march   the companies entered into an agreement with mli to use the proceeds from the sale of cobblestone golf group in excess of  to purchase all or a portion of the remaining  paired shares originally issed to mli in the feit 
on april   the companies fully settled the feit by paying mli  for the repurchase of the remaining  paired common shares 
on april   realty repaid  of its tranche b term loan and cancelled a  swap contract 
both were scheduled to mature on july  on august  realty repaid  of its notes payable which matured on that date and bore interest at 
on december   realty repaid  of its tranche c term loan which was scheduled to mature on january  operating had shareholders equity of  as of december  on january   the companies announced that the boards of directors had approved the five point plan  which provided for an orderly disposition of a significant portion of healthcare assets  suspension of realty s reit common share dividend  expectation of the declaration of the minimum dividend required to maintain reit status in december  substantial reduction in debt  and future disciplined investment in the lodging division 
the companies have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which the companies may issue  of securities including common stock  preferred stock  debt  series common stock  convertible debt and warrants to purchase shares  preferred shares  debt  series common stock and convertible debt 
operating believes that its various sources of capital available including operating cash flow and borrowings from realty are adequate to finance its operations 
recent legislative developments the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of the act  signed into law by the president of the united states on december   has modified certain provisions of federal income tax law applicable to reits 
all of the changes described below will be effective with respect to the companies beginning after the year ending december  these changes include new rules permitting a reit to own up to of the stock of a corporation a taxable reit subsidiary  taxable as a c corporation  that may provide non customary services to the reit s tenants and may engage in certain other business activities 
however  the taxable reit subsidiary cannot directly or indirectly operate or manage a lodging or healthcare facility 
although the taxable reit subsidiary may lease a lodging facility ie  a hotel from the reit provided no gambling revenues were derived from the hotel or on its premises  with the lodging facility operated by an eligible independent contractor  such eligible independent contractor must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating lodging facilities for persons or entities unrelated to the reit 
on account of the foregoing restrictions imposed on the use of taxable reit subsidiaries in the case of lodging and healthcare facilities  the opportunity for the companies to make use of taxable reit subsidiaries will be limited 
the act also replaces the former rule permitting a reit to own more than of a corporate subsidiary by value  provided its ownership of the voting power is limited to a decontrolled subsidiary  with a new rule prohibiting a reit from owning more than of a corporation by vote or value  other than a taxable reit subsidiary described above or a qualified reit subsidiary a wholly owned corporate subsidiary that is treated as part of the reit for all federal income tax purposes 
existing decontrolled subsidiaries are grandfathered  but will lose such status if they engage in a substantial new line of business or acquire any substantial new asset after july   other than pursuant to a contract binding on such date and at all times thereafter prior to acquisition 
accordingly  and taking into account the companies general inability to utilize taxable reit subsidiaries  the act severely limits the ability of realty to own substantial ownership interests in taxable corporate subsidiaries 
direct ownership by realty of assets that otherwise would be held in a decontrolled subsidiary may not be possible without disqualifying realty as a reit  and transfer of such assets to operating similarly may not be possible without causing realty to recognize taxable income or jeopardizing the companies current grandfather status under the anti paired share legislation enacted as part of the reform act 
other provisions in the act include a reduction in the annual minimum distribution requirement from to of its taxable income excluding net capital gain and a provision which allows a reit to own and operate a healthcare facility for at least two years with extensions for up to another four years possible if the facility is acquired by the termination or expiration of a lease  with net income with respect to such property subject to corporate tax but not counted as disqualifying income for purposes of qualification as a reit

year the year problem arose as a result of the fact that many existing computer programs and embedded chip technology systems were developed using only the last two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
thus  any information technology it systems with time sensitive software might recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
in addition  the companies were at risk from year failures on the part of third parties with which the companies interact 
the companies use a significant number of it systems that are essential to their operations 
for this reason  the companies developed and implemented a five phase plan to address their year issues the year plan and to insure that the companies it systems would function properly in the year and thereafter 
the companies believe that they have successfully rendered it systems year compliant 
since january   the companies have experienced no disruptions to their business operations as a result of year compliance problems or otherwise and have received no reports of any material year compliance problems with any third parties with which they have material interactions 
although the companies do not believe that they have continued exposure to the year issue  the companies cannot give assurances that they will not detect unanticipated year compliance issues in the future 
the companies budgeted  for its year plan and estimate that the costs of repairing  updating and replacing their standard it systems was approximately  additionally  the companies estimate that they spent approximately  to address other year issues 
because the companies year assessment is ongoing and additional funds may be required as a result of unexpected future findings in the first few quarters of the year  the companies are not able to estimate the final aggregate cost of the year problem 
while these efforts may involve additional costs  the companies believe  based on available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on their business  financial condition or results of operations 
the companies have funded the costs to date of addressing the year issue from cash flows resulting from operations 
the preceeding year disclosure contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements represent the companies beliefs of expectations regarding future events 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to  availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions of governmental agencies or other third parties with respect to year problems 
seasonality the lodging industry is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in revenue  profit margins and net earnings 
in addition  opening of new construction hotels and or timing of hotel acquisitions may cause variation of revenue from quarter to quarter 
certain factors you should consider unless the context otherwise requires  all references to we  us  or our refer generally to meditrust corporation and meditrust operating company  collectively  their subsidiaries and respective predecessor entities for the applicable periods  although the context may  in certain situations  require that these words refer to either meditrust corporation or meditrust operating company individually 
presented below are certain factors that you should consider with respect to an investment in our securities 
you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below  which may materially impact your investment in our securities or may in the future  and  in some cases  already do  materially affect us and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
you should carefully consider these factors 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements  you should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements discussed on page our strategic focus on lodging related properties exposes investors to risks common in that industry that may adversely affect an investment in our securities 
we have made a significant investment in lodging related facilities through our acquisition of la quinta inns  inc la quinta is operated by a subsidiary of meditrust operating company and its real estate assets are owned by meditrust corporation or a subsidiary of meditrust corporation 
the results of operations of la quinta hotels are subject to many factors  including changes in the national  regional and local general economic climate  competition from comparable hotels  the desirability of particular locations  the quality  philosophy and performance of the lodging facility managers  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation  the need to periodically repair the lodging facilities  increases in travel expenses that reduce business and leisure travel  and the relationship between supply of and demand for hotel rooms an oversupply of hotel properties or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms 
la quinta operates in a very competitive market 
la quinta hotels generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors  including a wide range of lodging facilities offering full service  limited service and all suite lodging options to the public 
the continued success of our hotels will be dependent  in large part  upon our ability to compete in such areas as affordable and competitive room rates  quality of accommodations  name recognition  service level and convenience of locations 
additionally  an increasing supply of hotel rooms in la quinta s market segment  and recent consolidations in the lodging industry generally  have resulted in the creation of several large  multi branded hotel chains with diversified operations and may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot give assurances that demographic  geographic or other changes in markets will not adversely affect the convenience or desirability of the locations of our hotels 
furthermore  we cannot give assurances that competing hotels will not provide greater competition for guests than currently exists  in the markets in which our hotels operate  and that new hotels will not enter such markets 
our lodging related properties are geographically concentrated 
la quinta s hotels are concentrated in the western and southern regions of the united states 
as a result  our lodging properties are particularly sensitive to adverse economic and competitive conditions and trends in those regions and such conditions may specifically affect our cash available for distribution to stockholders 
the concentration of properties in one region may expose us to risks of adverse economic developments which are greater than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse 
our lodging related business and operations are subject to extensive employment and other governmental regulation 
the lodging business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulatory requirements  including building and zoning requirements  all of which can prevent  delay  make uneconomical or significantly increase the cost of developing additional lodging facilities 
in addition  la quinta s hotels and meditrust operating company are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions  work permit requirements and discrimination claims 
an increase in the minimum wage rate  employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect us 
fluctuations in operating results are common in the lodging industry 
the lodging industry may be adversely affected by  among other things changes in economic conditions  changes in local market conditions  oversupply of hotel rooms  a reduction in demand for hotel space in specific areas  changes in travel patterns  weather conditions  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices or construction costs  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing for operating or capital needs and changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses 
room supply and demand historically have been sensitive to shifts in gross domestic product growth  which has resulted in cyclical changes in average daily room and occupancy rates 
due in part to the strong correlation between the lodging industry s performance and economic conditions  the lodging industry is subject to cyclical changes in revenues 
in that regard  we cannot give assurances that the recent strength in the lodging industry generally  or in the segment of the industry in which we operate  will not decline in the future 
furthermore  the lodging industry is seasonal in nature  with revenues typically higher in summer periods than in winter periods 
fluctuations in and difficulty with lodging construction may have an adverse affect on us 
if la quinta resumes its historical strategy of growing through new construction  we may from time to time experience shortages of materials or qualified tradespeople or volatile increases in the cost of certain construction materials or labor  resulting in longer than normal construction and remodeling periods  loss of revenue and increased costs 
we will rely heavily on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized or understaffed 
the inability or failure of one or more local contractors to perform may result in construction or remodeling delays  increased cost and loss of revenue 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect la quinta s operations which  in turn  could materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
the seasonality of the lodging industry may affect the ability of meditrust corporation s lessees and operators to make timely rent payments 
the seasonality of the lodging industry causes fluctuations in hotel revenues and may  from time to time  affect either the amount of rent that accrues under meditrust corporation s hotel leases or the ability of meditrust corporation s lessees and operators to make timely rent payments under the leases 
a lessee s or operator s inability to make timely rent payments to meditrust corporation could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
meditrust corporation s ownership of healthcare related properties exposes investors to risks common in that industry that may adversely affect an investment in our securities 
there are a number of operating risks that could have an adverse affect on meditrust corporation s healthcare related business 
one of meditrust corporation s primary businesses is that of buying  selling  financing and leasing healthcare related properties 
operating risks in this business include  among other things competition for tenants  competition from other healthcare financing providers  a number of which may have greater marketing  financial and other resources and experience than us  changes in government regulation of healthcare  changes in the availability and cost of insurance coverage  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing  and adverse effects on general and local economic conditions 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the skilled nursing industry may adversely affect the ability of third party operators of meditrust corporation s healthcare properties to make their payments 
the skilled nursing businesses of the third party operators of meditrust corporation s healthcare related real estate  and the healthcare industry generally  are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation governing the licensing and conduct of operations at healthcare facilities  certain capital expenditures  the quality of services provided  the manner in which the services are provided  financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers and reimbursement for services rendered 
the failure of any third party operator to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect its effectiveness in operating the facility or facilities 
any such ineffectiveness could impair such operator s ability to make payments to meditrust corporation and thereby adversely affect us 
a high concentration of investment in the skilled nursing industry compounds the risks associated with this industry 
as of september   skilled nursing facilities comprised of meditrust corporation s real estate investments 
for the reasons mentioned in the risk factor above  such a concentration in this type of facility could have a material adverse effect on us 
we rely heavily on third party operators associated with many of our properties 
third party operators manage skilled nursing facilities on each of our properties 
our financial position may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any such operators  including the bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn in the business of any such operator  or in the event any such operator does not renew its leases as they expire and meditrust corporation cannot lease these facilities to other operators on comparable terms 
in particular  meditrust corporation s investments in the facilities operated by its two largest healthcare operators at september  amounts to approximately of its total real estate investments 
such a concentration in these operators could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have no control over increased government regulation in the healthcare industry generally 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic  regulatory and demographic influences that may affect the operations of healthcare facilities and providers 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to changes in government regulation of many aspects of the industry for example  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
some elected officials have announced that they intend to examine certain aspects of the united states healthcare system  including proposals which may further increase governmental involvement in healthcare 
for example  the president and congress have in the past  and may in the future  propose healthcare reforms which could impose additional regulations on meditrust corporation and its operators or limit the amounts that operators may charge for services 
meditrust corporation s healthcare facility operators are  and will continue to be  subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by health or social service agencies and other regulatory authorities in the various states and localities in which they operate or in which they will operate 
recent significant healthcare reform has  and likely will continue to  adversely affect our operations in the healthcare industry 
the balanced budget act of  which was signed by the president on august   enacted significant changes to the medicare and medicaid programs designed to modernize payment and healthcare delivery systems while achieving substantial budgetary savings 
in seeking to limit medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing services  the balanced budget act of mandated the establishment of a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities to replace the current cost based reimbursement system 
the cost based system reimburses skilled nursing facilities for reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in providing routine services as well as capital costs and ancillary costs  subject to limits fixed for the particular geographic area served by the skilled nursing facility 
under the prospective payment system  skilled nursing facilities will be paid a federal per diem rate for covered services 
the per diem payment will cover routine service  ancillary  and capital related costs 
the prospective payment system is being phased in over a four year period beginning on or after july  under provisions of the balanced budget act of  states will be provided additional flexibility in managing their medicaid program 
among other things  the balanced budget act of repealed a federal payment standard  which had required states to pay reasonable and adequate payments to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated hospitals  nursing facilities and certain intermediate care facilities 
we have no control over these federal reimbursement rates  which may change periodically 
additionally  these healthcare reforms may reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care  which could adversely affect the revenues of meditrust corporation s third party borrowers and lessees 
such adverse effects on meditrust corporation s third party borrowers may negatively impact those borrowers and lessees abilities to make their loan or lease payments to meditrust corporation 
in fact  three of meditrust corporation s third party operators have cited these healthcare reforms as the precipitating factor in filing for bankruptcy protection 
failure of the borrowers or lessees to make their loan or lease payments would have a direct and material adverse effect on us 
we cannot give assurances that third party reimbursement for meditrust corporation s operators will continue to be available 
the cost of many of the services offered by the current operators of meditrust corporation s healthcare facilities are reimbursed or paid for by third party payers such as medicare and medicaid programs for elderly  low income and disabled patients and state medicaid programs for managed care organizations 
no assurance can be given that such third party reimbursement to meditrust corporation s operators will continue to be available or when reimbursement will be offered or that reimbursement rates will not be reduced 
the increase in the number of providers contracting to provide per person fixed cost healthcare to a patient population has increased pressure on third party payers to lower costs 
a significant portion of the revenue from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from meditrust corporation is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
these programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
in recent years  there have been fundamental changes in the medicare program which have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of healthcare services  which meditrust corporation has no control over 
moreover  healthcare facilities have experienced increasing pressures from private payers such as health maintenance organizations attempting to control healthcare costs 
reimbursement from private payers has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payers 
concern regarding healthcare costs may result in significant reductions in payment to healthcare facilities  and there can be no assurance that future payment rates from either governmental or private healthcare plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are already insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect revenues from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from meditrust corporation and thereby adversely affect those entities ability to make their lease or loan payments to meditrust corporation 
failure of these entities to make their lease or loan payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us 
a failure to comply with the more prevalent fraud and abuse laws and governmental program integrity regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 
in the past several years  due to rising healthcare costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
federal and state statutes generally prohibit payment of any remuneration to induce the referral of medicare and medicaid patients 
both federal and state self referral statutes severely restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
the balanced budget act of provided the federal government with expanded enforcement powers to combat waste  fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services 
in addition  the office of inspector general and the healthcare financing administration have increased investigation and enforcement activity of fraud and abuse  specifically targeting nursing homes  home health providers and medical equipment suppliers 
failure to comply with the foregoing fraud and abuse laws or government program integrity regulations may result in sanctions  including the loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs including medicare and medicaid  asset forfeitures and civil and criminal penalties 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and informant activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
in the event that any borrower or lessee of meditrust corporation were to be found in violation of the applicable laws regarding fraud  abuse or self referral  that borrower s or lessee s license or certification to participate in government reimbursement programs could be jeopardized  or that borrower or lessee could be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties 
either of these occurrences could have a material adverse affect on us by adversely affecting the borrower s or lessee s ability to make debt or lease payments to meditrust corporation 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect the ability of the operators of meditrust corporation s healthcare facilities to generate revenues and make payments to it 
this  in turn  could materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
it is difficult to be continuously up to date with current information regarding third party operators of meditrust corporation s healthcare properties 
as of december   our healthcare portfolio comprised approximately of meditrust corporation s total real estate investments 
a private healthcare company and sun healthcare currently operate approximately of the total real estate investments and of the healthcare portfolio 
approximately of meditrust corporation s total real estate investments approximately of the healthcare portfolio are operated by companies in the skilled nursing sector of the healthcare industry and of meditrust corporation s total real estate investments approximately of the healthcare portfolio are operated by companies in the assisted living sector of the healthcare industry 
meditrust corporation monitors credit risk for our healthcare portfolio by evaluating a combination of publicly available financial information  information provided by the operators themselves and information otherwise available to us 
the financial condition and ability of these healthcare operators to meet their rental and other obligations will  among other things  have an impact on meditrust corporation s revenues  net income or loss  funds available from operations and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the operations of the skilled nursing companies have been negatively impacted by changes in medicare reimbursement rates  increases in labor costs  increases in their leverage and various other factors 
in addition  any failure by these operators to effectively conduct their operations could have a material adverse effect on their business reputation or on their ability to enlist and maintain patients in their facilities 
operators of assisted living and skilled nursing facilities are experiencing fill up periods of a longer duration  and are being impacted by concerns regarding the potential of over building  increased regulation and the use of certain accounting practices 
accordingly  many of these operators have pre announced anticipated earnings shortfalls and have experienced a significant decline in their stock prices 
these factors have had a detrimental impact on the liquidity of some assisted living operators  which has caused their growth plans to decelerate and may have a negative effect on their operating cash flows 
three of meditrust corporation s healthcare facility operators have filed for bankruptcy 
citing the effects of changes in government regulation relating to medicare reimbursement as the precipitating factor  sun healthcare filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on october  as of december   meditrust corporation had a portfolio of properties operated by sun healthcare  which consisted of owned properties with net assets of approximately million and mortgages with net assets of approximately million 
during the year ended december   income derived from these properties included rental income of million from owned properties and interest income of million from mortgages 
no mortgage interest payments were received after october  sun healthcare has not formally indicated whether it will accept or reject any of meditrust corporation s leases 
sun healthcare has indicated  however  that they will continue to make lease payments to meditrust corporation unless and until such leases are rejected 
if necessary  meditrust corporation has a plan in place to transition and to continue operating any of such rejected sun healthcare properties 
since october  meditrust corporation has not received interest payments related to the mortgages 
accordingly  such mortgages have been put on non accrual status 
should sun healthcare reject certain leases and revise lease terms for the respective facilities  meditrust corporation s cash flows  revenues and results of operations may be impacted and these amounts may be material 
management is not currently able to predict the outcome of the sun healthcare bankruptcy or the related impact on meditrust corporation s cash flows  revenues or results of operations 
citing reasons similar to sun healthcare  mariner health group  inc and integrated health services  inc also filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on january  and february   respectively 
as of december   meditrust corporation had a portfolio of two properties operated by mariner  which consisted of one owned property with net assets of approximately million and one mortgage with net assets of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we derived interest and rental income from the mariner properties of approximately million 
if we do not receive interest payments related to the mortgage we will not continue to record interest income 
as of december   integrated health services operated of meditrust corporation s owned properties that had a book value of approximately million in the aggregate 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately million in rental income from the integrated health services properties 
our substantial debt  as well as the various other risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing  could result in adverse consequences for us 
we are dependent on external sources of capital 
to qualify as a real estate investment trust  meditrust corporation must distribute to its stockholders each year at least of meditrust corporation s net taxable income commencing in  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that meditrust corporation will be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital required for potential acquisitions  from income from operations 
meditrust corporation  therefore  will have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
meditrust corporation s access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors  including general market conditions  the market s perception of meditrust corporation s growth potential  meditrust corporation s current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of meditrust corporation s common stock 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests  and additional debt financing may substantially further leverage meditrust corporation 
meditrust corporation is substantially leveraged 
meditrust corporation s debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately as of september  meditrust operating company  as a guarantor under meditrust corporation s credit facility  is also substantially leveraged 
this degree of debt could have important consequences for investors and for us  some of which include our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired  both currently and in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on this indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal  interest or dividends  we may be substantially more leveraged than our competitors  putting us at a competitive disadvantage  and our flexibility to adjust to market conditions is limited  leaving us vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
despite our plan to decrease the amount of our debt as announced on january  in our plan of reorganization  we cannot make assurances that we will be able to repay enough debt to successfully deleverage 
meditrust corporation may not be able to renew  repay or refinance when due the indebtedness on our properties or unsecured indebtedness or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of such original indebtedness 
if meditrust corporation were unable to refinance the indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses  which losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on such indebtedness 
meditrust corporation has million in term debt that will mature in july and an additional billion in debt that matures in if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and meditrust corporation is unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of revenues and asset value to us 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering meditrust corporation s ability to meet the real estate investment trust distribution requirements of the internal revenue code 
we are subject to the risks associated with indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
we have incurred  and expect in the future to incur  indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs to the extent that the related indebtedness was not protected by interest rate protection arrangements  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead our stockholders to demand a higher yield on their paired shares from our distributions  which could adversely affect the market price for the paired shares and could also adversely affect the market price of any preferred stock issued by either or both of the meditrust companies 
meditrust corporation s real property investments are subject to the many varying types and degrees of risk inherent in owning real estate and that may affect the value of our assets and our ability to generate revenue  net income and cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
the illiquidity of real estate as an investment limits meditrust corporation s ability to sell properties quickly in response to market conditions 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore cannot be purchased or sold rapidly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
buyers may not be identified quickly or such buyers may not be able to secure suitable financing to consummate a transaction 
in addition  the internal revenue code limits meditrust corporation s ability as a real estate investment trust to make sales of properties held for fewer than four years 
furthermore  sales of certain appreciated property could generate material adverse tax consequences  which may affect meditrust corporation s ability to sell properties in response to market conditions and adversely affect returns to stockholders 
consequently  there can be no assurances that we will be able to accomplish an orderly disposition of a significant portion of the healthcare assets as announced on january  meditrust corporation depends and relies on the ability and success of those who operate  manage  lease and maintain our properties 
federal income tax law restricts real estate investment trusts from deriving revenues directly from operating their properties 
thus  the underlying value of meditrust corporation s real estate investments  results of operations and ability to make distributions to stockholders and pay amounts due on indebtedness depends on the ability of the operators  managers  lessees and meditrust operating company to operate meditrust corporation s properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient revenues in excess of operating expenses to make rent payments under their leases or loan payments in respect of their loans from meditrust corporation 
the results of operations of meditrust corporation s properties may be adversely affected by many factors outside of meditrust corporation s control 
results of operations of meditrust corporation s properties may also be adversely affected by  among other things changes in national economic conditions  changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of financing  the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws and other regulatory requirements  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in real estate tax rates and assessments and other operating expenses  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  adverse changes in zoning and other land use laws  and civil unrest  earthquakes and other natural disasters which may result in uninsured losses and other factors which are beyond our control 
meditrust corporation depends on the rental income from our real property 
meditrust corporation s cash flow  results of operations and the value of our assets would be adversely affected if a significant number of third party operators of our properties failed to meet their lease obligations 
these lease payments are one of meditrust corporation s principal sources of revenue 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major operator may have an adverse effect on a property 
at any time  an operator also may seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of such operator s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash flow from the property 
we have no control over such reduction and cannot assure investors that any of our third party operators will have sufficient assets  income  and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their obligations under any such lease 
if an operator rejects its lease  the owner s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim be treated as a general unsecured claim 
generally  the amount of the claim would be capped at the amount owed for unpaid pre petition lease payments unrelated to the rejection  plus the greater of one year s lease payments or of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease but not to exceed the amount of three years lease payments 
meditrust corporation s operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on or under the property 
environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not such substances originated from the property 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate such property properly  may adversely affect our ability to use such real property as collateral in borrowing 
persons who arrange for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials  into the environment 
in addition  third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos containing materials or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the use or transfer of property  and these restrictions may require various expenditures by meditrust corporation 
in connection with the ownership and operation of any of meditrust corporation s properties  we and the other lessees or operators of these properties may be liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
our failure to comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act of would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness  our business and our results of operations 
under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the americans with disabilities act could result in the imposition of fines and or an award of damages to private litigants 
if we were required to make modifications to comply with the americans with disabilities act  there could be a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
meditrust corporation s failure to obtain and maintain proper insurance on our properties would have a material adverse effect on us 
meditrust corporation is directly responsible for insuring our lodging related properties 
additionally  each of meditrust corporation s leases and mortgage loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance is to be maintained on each of the applicable properties  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
leases and loan documents for new investments including those leased to meditrust operating company typically contain similar provisions 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes and floods  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
we will use our discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
this may result in insurance coverage that  in the event of a substantial loss  would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the lost investment and also may result in certain losses being totally uninsured 
inflation  changes in building codes  zoning or other land use ordinances  environmental considerations  lender imposed restrictions and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds  if any  received by meditrust corporation might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property 
an investment in our securities may have adverse tax consequences to the investor 
meditrust corporation s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust could have serious adverse financial consequences 
meditrust corporation operates  and intends to continue to operate in the future  so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes 
meditrust corporation believes that it has operated in a manner that permits it to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the internal revenue code 
qualification as a real estate investment trust  however  involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions is greater in the case of a paired share real estate investment trust 
in addition  real estate investment trust qualification involves the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust  meditrust corporation must derive at least of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources and meditrust corporation must distribute annually to stockholders commencing in of its real estate investment trust taxable income  excluding net taxable gains 
as a result  although we believe meditrust corporation is organized and operating in a manner that permits it to remain qualified as a real estate investment trust  we cannot guarantee that meditrust corporation will be able to continue to operate in such a manner 
in addition  if we are ever audited by the internal revenue service with respect to any past year  the internal revenue service may challenge meditrust corporation s qualification as a real estate investment trust for such year 
if meditrust corporation were to fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust  it would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
such failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would result in additional tax liability for the year or years involved 
this additional tax could significantly reduce  or possibly eliminate  the amount of cash meditrust corporation would have available for investment or distribution to stockholders 
in addition  the failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would also constitute a default under certain of our debt obligations  which would generally allow the holders thereof to demand the immediate repayment of such indebtedness  and significantly reduce the market value of our stock 
each of these possible outcomes could have a material adverse effect on us 
recent legislation has curbed the use of the paired share structure 
meditrust corporation s ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust is further dependent upon its continued exemption from the anti pairing rules of section b a of the code  which would ordinarily prevent it from qualifying as a real estate investment trust 
subject to the discussion below regarding recent legislation  the grandfathering rules governing section b generally provide that section b a does not apply to a paired share real estate investment trust if the real estate investment trust and its paired operating company were paired on june  on june   meditrust corporation then known as santa anita enterprises  inc was paired with the meditrust operating company which was then known as santa anita operating company 
there are  however  no judicial or administrative authorities interpreting this grandfathering rule 
moreover  if for any reason meditrust corporation failed to qualify as a real estate investment trust in  the benefit of the grandfathering rule would not be available to it  in which case meditrust corporation would not qualify as a real estate investment trust for any taxable year from and after such failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
on july   the president signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of included in the reform act is a freeze on the grandfathered status of paired share real estate investment trusts 
under this legislation  the anti pairing rules provided in the internal revenue code apply to real property interests we acquired after march   or acquired by a subsidiary or partnership in which a or greater interest we own  unless the real property interests are acquired pursuant to a written agreement that was binding on march  and at all times thereafter  or the acquisition of such real property interests was described in a public announcement or in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on or before march  these restrictions on the activities of a grandfathered paired share real estate investment trust provided for in the reform act may in the future make it impractical or undesirable for us to continue to maintain our paired share structure 
restructuring our operations to comply with the rules provided by the reform act could cause us to incur tax liabilities  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill assets  or otherwise materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
we have no control over changes in legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions 
we can give no assurances that new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax law with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust and the federal income tax consequence of such qualification 
such legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
in addition  this type of legislation could prevent us from growing as originally intended 
meditrust corporation is subject to some taxes even if it qualifies as a real estate investment trust 
even if meditrust corporation qualifies as a real estate investment trust  it is subject to some federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
for example  meditrust corporation pays taxes on certain income it does not distribute 
also  meditrust corporation s income derived from properties located in some states are subject to local taxes and  if meditrust corporation enters into transactions which the internal revenue code labels as prohibited transactions  meditrust corporation s net income from such transactions would be subject to a tax 
the real estate investment trust minimum distribution requirements may result in adverse consequences to investors 
meditrust corporation may be subject to taxes in connection with the distribution of assets acquired in acquisitions 
in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust  meditrust corporation is generally required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least commencing in of its taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  if meditrust corporation was to dispose of assets acquired in certain acquisitions during the ten year period following the acquisition  it would be required to distribute at least commencing in of the amount of any built in gain attributable to such assets that meditrust corporation recognizes in the disposition  less the amount of any tax paid with respect to such recognized built in gain 
meditrust corporation generally is subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions paid by meditrust corporation with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of meditrust corporation s ordinary income for that year  of meditrust corporation s capital gain net income for that year  and of meditrust corporation s undistributed income from prior years 
meditrust corporation may need to borrow money to meet its minimum distribution requirements and to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust 
meditrust corporation s ability to make distributions to stockholders could be adversely affected by increased debt service obligations if it needs to borrow money in order to maintain its real estate investment trust qualification 
for example  differences in timing between when meditrust corporation receives income and when it has to pay expenses could require meditrust corporation to borrow money to meet the requirement that meditrust corporation distributes to its stockholders at least commencing in of its net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains 
the incurrence of large expenses also could cause meditrust corporation to need to borrow money to meet this requirement 
meditrust corporation might need to borrow money for these purposes even if we believe that market conditions are not favorable for such borrowings and  therefore  we may borrow money on unfavorable terms 
meditrust corporation s funds from operations and cash distributions may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
we believe that the market value of a real estate investment trust s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the real estate investment trust s growth potential  including its prospects for accretive acquisitions and development and its current and potential future cash distributions  and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent meditrust corporation retains operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock 
meditrust corporation s failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future funds from operations and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our publicly traded securities 
one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a real estate investment trust is the distribution rate on such shares  as a percentage of the price of such shares relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of our equity securities may expect a higher dividend yield 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for meditrust corporation to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease cash available for distribution to the extent that our indebtedness has floating interest rates 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our publicly traded securities to go down 
provisions of our charters and bylaws could inhibit changes in control that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide our stockholders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of their paired shares or which might otherwise be in their best interests 
these include a staggered board of directors as well as the ownership limitations in each of our respective amended and restated certificates of incorporation 
we depend on our key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
we cannot give assurances that no further risks remain with respect to the year although at this point we have not identified any specific business functions that have suffered any material disruptions as a result of year events  we cannot give assurances that there is not risk of year related disruptions in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on us
