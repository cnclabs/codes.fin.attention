overview sunrise is a provider of assisted living services for seniors 
sunrise currently operates facilities in states and in the united kingdom  with a resident capacity of more than  residents  including facilities owned by sunrise or in which it has ownership interests  facilities owned by sunrise and held for sale following the acquisition of karrington health  inc and facilities managed for third parties 
sunrise provides assistance with the activities of daily living and other personalized support services in a residential setting for elderly residents who cannot live independently but who do not need the level of medical care provided in a skilled nursing facility 
sunrise also provides additional specialized care and services to residents with certain low acuity medical needs and residents with alzheimer s disease or other forms of dementia 
by offering this full range of services  sunrise is able to accommodate the changing needs of residents as they age and develop further physical or cognitive frailties 
sunrise has continued to experience growth in operations over the months ended december  and continued to capitalize on its brand awareness by accepting third party management and development contracts 
during this period  sunrise began operating an additional facilities in which it has an ownership interest including facilities held for sale following the acquisition of karrington and managing an additional three facilities for independent third parties 
sunrise also entered into several third party management and development contracts during as a result  total operating revenue increased substantially to million for from million for  and correspondingly  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased to million for from million for average resident occupancy for stabilized facilities increased to for from for  and the average daily resident fee for these stabilized facilities increased to for from for net income  however  decreased to million for  or per share diluted  from million for  or per share diluted 
the decrease in net income between and was due in part to an million increase in general and administrative expenses  recognition of non recurring charges of million  million in development and pre rental expenses resulting from termination of a development project in the southeast and the recognition of million of income taxes in in prior years  income tax expense was offset by recognizing tax benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
sunrise s growth objectives include developing new sunrise model assisted living facilities and selectively acquiring existing facilities 
sunrise currently has facilities under construction with a resident capacity of approximately  sunrise has also entered into contracts to purchase additional development sites  of which are zoned  and to lease one additional site 
sunrise is pursuing additional development opportunities and also plans to acquire additional facilities as market conditions warrant 
in connection with the implementation of its growth plans  in prior years sunrise made significant investments in its infrastructure through the addition of information technology  as well as additions to headquarters and regional staff 
during  sunrise continued to invest in these areas to support both the growth of sunrise and to provide expansion and enhancement to some of its existing computer and communication systems  and completed efforts to ensure these systems were year compliant 
sunrise has expanded its previously announced plan of selling selected real estate assets  subject to market conditions  as a normal part of its operations while retaining long term management through operating agreements  to include the potential sale of approximately properties each year 
this strategy of selling selected real estate assets as a normal part of operations should enable sunrise to reduce debt  redeploy its capital into new development projects and realize gains on appreciated real estate 
in june  sunrise completed the sale of two assisted living facilities located in columbia  maryland and norwood  massachusetts for an aggregate sales price of million in cash 
the transaction will result in the realization of up to an million gain over quarters following the sale 
as of december   sunrise recognized million of the gain 
previously  in september  sunrise completed the sale of two assisted living facilities located in maryland for an aggregate sales price of million in cash that will result in the realization of up to a million gain over a maximum of quarters following the sale 
as of december   sunrise has recognized million of the gain 
the remaining gain is deferred  the recognition of which is contingent upon future events 
for tax purposes  the transactions were set up as tax free exchanges 
sunrise continues to operate the facilities under long term operating agreements 
on may   sunrise completed its acquisition of karrington health  inc through a tax free  stock for stock transaction in which it issued million common shares in exchange for all the outstanding shares of karrington and karrington became a wholly owned subsidiary of sunrise 
the total transaction was valued at million  including merger and stock issuance costs of million and the fair value of assumed employee stock options of million 
karrington operates assisted living facilities providing services to the elderly 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations of karrington for the period from may  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  which are subject to adjustment when additional information concerning asset and liability valuations is finalized 
the million of costs in excess of assets acquired are being amortized on a straight line basis over years  which represents the weighted average useful lives of the assets purchased 
the carrying amounts of all intangibles  which represented of total assets and of stockholders equity as of december   are reviewed for impairment annually 
if the review indicates that the intangible assets are not expected to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows of the acquired assets over the remaining amortization periods  the carrying value of the intangible assets will be adjusted 
sunrise intends to sell karrington operating properties  four zoned development sites and one non operating property  which were inconsistent with sunrise s product and market strategy 
most of the facilities are karrington cottage prototype models  which consist of units or less 
these properties are classified as assets held for sale on the accompanying balance sheet 
sunrise anticipates completing the sale of substantially all of the assets held for sale by the third quarter of due to market conditions in the areas where the assets held for sale are located  sunrise elected in december to adjust downward the value assigned to certain of these assets  which resulted in an adjustment to the original purchase price allocation of the karrington acquisition 
as a result of the adjustment  the carrying value of assets held for sale decreased by million from sunrise s original estimated assigned fair value 
the valuation adjustments are reflected as a change in goodwill and the deferred tax accounts that are associated with the karrington acquisition 
sunrise has continued its efforts to explore international development and acquisition possibilities 
to date  sunrise has entered into a joint venture arrangement with a third party that is providing up to million of the equity capital to develop up to projects in the united kingdom and canada 
a director of sunrise is a managing director in the third party that is providing such equity capital and a former director is a general partner in the third party 
currently  the joint venture has one property operating in the united kingdom  six properties under development in canada  a purchase commitment for a property in canada and a purchase commitment for a property in the united kingdom 
sunrise provides management and development services to the joint venture on a contract fee basis with rights to acquire the assets in the future and has agreed to invest up to million of equity capital in the joint venture 
as of december   the third party has provided approximately million and sunrise has provided million of equity capital to the joint venture 
sunrise s board of directors has authorized sunrise to repurchase outstanding shares of sunrise common stock up to an aggregate purchase price of million 
sunrise expects to fund the stock repurchases from available funds and the expansion of its asset sale manage back program 
under the stock repurchase program  sunrise is authorized to repurchase sunrise common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time over the next months  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
the stock repurchase program does not obligate sunrise to repurchase any specific number of shares  and repurchases pursuant to the program may be suspended or resumed at any time or from time to time without further notice or announcement 
results of operations the following table sets forth data expressed as a percentage of operating revenue year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses facility operating facility contract services facility development and pre rental general and administrative depreciation and amortization facility lease non recurring charges total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures minority interests provision for income taxes net income sunrise derives its revenues from two primary sources resident fees for the delivery of assisted living services and management services income for management and development of facilities owned by third parties 
historically  most of sunrise s operating revenue has come from resident fees  which in  and comprised  and of total operating revenues  respectively 
residents  their families or other responsible parties typically pay resident fees monthly 
in  and approximately of sunrise s revenue was derived from private pay sources 
resident fees include revenue derived from basic care  community fees  plus care  reminiscence tm and other resident related services 
community fees are one time fees generally equal to to times the daily resident fee payable by a resident upon admission 
plus care and reminiscence tm fees are paid by residents who require personal care in excess of services provided under the basic care program 
management services income represents fees from long term contracts for facilities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures and other third party owners 
management services income includes management fees  which are generally in the range of to of a managed facility s total operating revenue for homes in operation  and development fees for site acquisition  development services  facility design and construction management services 
management services income accounted for  and of operating revenue in    respectively 
sunrise classifies its operating expenses into the following categories facility operating  which include labor  food  marketing and other direct facility expenses  facility contract services  which include operating expenses reimbursable to sunrise facility development and pre rental  which include non capitalized development expenses and pre rental labor and marketing expenses  general and administrative  which primarily include headquarters and regional staff expenses and other overhead costs  depreciation and amortization  and facility lease  which represent rental expenses for facilities and property not owned by sunrise 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenue 
operating revenue for increased to million from million for due primarily to the growth in resident fees 
resident fees  including community fees  for increased million  or  to million from million for this increase was due primarily to the inclusion  for the year ended december   of approximately million from the karrington properties acquired in may and million of resident fees generated from the operations of new sunrise developed assisted living facilities open in that were not open during another million of the increase in resident fees was from facilities operated for a full year in versus a partial period in this increase was partially offset by an million decrease in resident fees due to the sale of properties in and the remaining increase in resident fees was primarily due to an increase in the average daily resident fee excluding community fees for owned facilities operated by sunrise for at least twelve months or that have achieved occupancy percentages of or above stabilized facilities 
average resident occupancy for stabilized facilities increased to for from for the occupancy rate excludes facilities with temporary vacancies and resident relocations generally of between three to six months due to renovations 
sunrise increased its owned and operated stabilized facilities by percent over to stabilized facilities for from stabilized facilities in the average daily resident fee  excluding community fees  for these stabilized facilities increased to for from for the increase is due to the inclusion of additional stabilized prototype facilities which have higher basic care rates  a general increase in the basic care rate at other facilities and an increase in the number of residents receiving plus care and reminiscence tm care services 
for the communities currently owned  which were stabilized in both periods  occupancy increased to for from for the average resident occupancy of the properties acquired from karrington in may increased from for the third quarter of to for the fourth quarter of management services income for increased to million from million for this million increase resulted primarily from additional development contracts entered into in with unconsolidated joint ventures and third party owners 
the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in development fees to million for from million for relating to the development of facilities for unconsolidated joint ventures and third party owners 
this increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of development contracts entered into during facility contract services revenue for increased to million from million for of the million increase  was primarily due to the addition of two facilities under long term operating agreements in the remaining million increase in facility contract services revenue was from operating two facilities sold in for a full year in versus a partial period in in  sunrise recognized gains of million on the sale of assisted living communities compared to million in operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased by to million from million for the increase in operating expenses for was attributable to increases in all of the following expenses facility operating  facility development and pre rental  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization and facility lease 
sunrise also incurred significant non recurring charges in facility operating expense for increased by to million from million for as a percentage of resident fees  facility operating expense for increased to from for of the million increase  million was attributable to expenses from operations at the karrington properties and million from operations at new sunrise developed assisted living facilities open in that were not open in another million of the increase in facility operating expenses was from facilities operating for a full year in versus a partial period in this increase was partially offset by a million decrease due to sale of properties in and the remaining balance of the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and general and administrative expense at facilities that were operational for a full year in both periods 
facility contract services expense for increased to million from million for of the million increase  was primarily due to the addition of two facilities under long term operating agreements in the remaining million increase in facility contract services expense was from operating two facilities sold in for a full year in versus a partial period in facility development and pre rental expenses for increased to million from million for the million increase in facility development and pre rental expenses for was primarily related to an increase in development costs related to third party development activity 
general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in as a percentage of operating revenue  general and administrative expenses for increased to compared to in the million increase in general and administrative expenses for was primarily related to labor costs  consisting of hiring and training additional staff at the headquarters and regional offices 
the additional staffing is due  in part  to the new facilities operated in  including three managed facilities and the facilities acquired from karrington in depreciation and amortization expenses for compared to increased million  or  to million from million for primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense  partially offset by a million decrease in amortization expense 
of the increase in depreciation expense  million related to the acquisition of the karrington properties and million related to new sunrise developed facilities that were not open in another million of the increase in depreciation expense was from facilities operating for a full year in versus a partial year in this increase was partially offset by million due to the sale of properties in and facility lease expense increased million to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to the operation of additional karrington leased properties assumed in the acquisition 
sunrise recorded non recurring charges of million during  of which million related to the consolidation and integration of the acquired operations and development pipeline of karrington and million related to the termination of a property acquisition agreement 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million for compared to million for this increase in interest income is primarily due to interest income from notes receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased for to million from million for of this increase  million was due to interest on additional borrowings under one of sunrise s existing credit facilities and million was due to additional borrowings under new credit facilities 
another million was due to the debt assumed through the acquisition of karrington 
interest expense was offset  in part  by a million increase in capitalized interest during equity in losses earnings of unconsolidated assisted living facilities 
equity in losses of unconsolidated assisted living facilities for was million compared to earnings of approximately zero for the million increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated assisted living facilities is primarily due to startup losses of the joint venture properties that opened in  in which sunrise has ownership interests ranging from to provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and zero for and  respectively 
the difference between the tax provision calculated at the statutory federal income tax rate and the actual tax provision recorded for each year are as follows year ended december  statutory rate state taxes  net valuation allowance and other realization of the deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
sunrise expects to fully utilize the loss carryforwards prior to expiration 
therefore  the valuation allowance at december  of million was released in  of which  was credited directly to equity see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenue 
operating revenue for increased to million from million for due primarily to the growth in resident fees 
resident fees  including community fees  for increased million  or  to million from million for this increase was due primarily to the inclusion for the year ended december  of approximately million of resident fees generated from the operations of additional facilities opened in and a million increase in resident fees from facilities operated for a full year in that were initially opened in the remaining increase in resident fees was primarily due to an increase in the average daily resident fee  excluding community fees  for owned facilities operated by sunrise for at least twelve months 
average resident occupancy for stabilized facilities remained unchanged at for both and the occupancy rate excludes facilities with temporary vacancies and resident relocations generally of between three to six months due to renovations 
the average daily resident fee  excluding community fees for stabilized facilities increased to for from for the increase is due to the inclusion of additional stabilized prototype facilities which have higher basic care rates  a general increase in the basic care rate at other facilities  and an increase in the number of residents receiving plus care and reminiscence tm care services 
average resident occupancy for owned facilities in initial resident lease up increased to for from for the average daily resident fee  excluding community fees  for these facilities increased to for from for management services income for increased to million from million for the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in development and management fees to million for from million for relating to the development of facilities for unconsolidated joint ventures and third party owners 
this increase is primarily due to the increase in the number of development and management contracts entered into from the fourth quarter of through sunrise had development and management contracts as of december  and development and management contracts as of december  in  sunrise recognized a gain of million on the sale of two assisted living communities and a million gain on the sale of its minority interest in a tenancy in common that owned one facility 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased by to million from million for the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increases in all of the following areas facility operating  facility contract services  general and administrative  depreciation and amortization and facility lease expenses 
facility operating expense for increased to million from million for as a percentage of resident fees  facility operating expense for decreased to from for of the million increase  million was attributable to expenses from the operations of additional assisted living facilities operated by sunrise in as compared to and million was attributable to facilities operated for a full year in that were initially opened in the remaining balance of the increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and general and administrative expense at facilities that were operational for a full year in both periods 
general and administrative expense for increased to million from million for as a percentage of operating revenue  general and administrative expense for decreased to from for  which is a reflection of higher operating revenue in the period 
the million increase in general and administrative expense for was primarily related to labor costs  consisting of hiring and training additional staff at the headquarters and regional offices 
depreciation and amortization expense for compared to increased million  or  to million from million 
of the increase  million related to homes opened during and million related to homes operated for a full year in that were initially opened in facility lease expense increased million primarily due to the opening of two facilities developed and leased by sunrise in and two facilities operated for a full year in initially opened in other income expense 
interest income decreased to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased funds available for investment  offset  in part  by an increase in interest income from notes receivable 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased for to million from million for of this increase  million was due to a full year of interest on sunrise s million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due issued in june and million was due to interest on additional borrowings under one of sunrise s credit facilities 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest in versus due to a reduction in the average balance of funded project costs 
income tax 
sunrise generated taxable income for the year ended december  for the first time since its formation 
income tax expense for the year was offset by a million reduction in sunrise s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the change in the valuation allowance reflects the reduction of the combined net difference in net book and tax bases of property and equipment  the expected tax benefit of various timing differences and the anticipated utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
of the remaining million unrecognized deferred tax assets  approximately million related to the remaining difference between the net book and tax bases of property and equipment and approximately million related to the tax benefit of nonqualified stock options that have not been recognized for tax purposes 
when the valuation allowance related to the nonqualified stock options was released  the tax benefit was credited directly to equity in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
realization of the tax benefits associated with the long term deferred tax assets is dependent on sunrise generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforward and reversals of the timing differences 
based on this uncertainty  sunrise maintained a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax asset at december  liquidity and capital resources to date  the sunrise has financed its operations from long term borrowings  equity offerings and cash generated from operations 
at december   sunrise had million of outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
of the amount of outstanding debt  sunrise had million of fixed rate debt  excluding a million loan discount  at a weighted average interest rate of  and million of variable rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
increases in prevailing interest rates could increase sunrise s interest payment obligations relating to variable rate debt 
for example  a one percent increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
at december   sunrise had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including million in high quality short term investments a p rated and currently has million of unused lines of credit 
at december   a subsidiary of sunrise had a syndicated revolving credit facility for million 
sunrise guarantees the repayment of all amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by cross collateralized first mortgages on the real property and improvements and first liens on all other assets of the subsidiary 
advances under the facility bear interest at libor plus 
there were million of advances outstanding under this credit facility as of december  the credit facility expires in july other subsidiaries have revolving credit facilities totaling million 
the repayments of the amounts outstanding under these credit facilities are also guaranteed by sunrise 
the credit facilities are secured by real property and first liens on other assets 
advances under these facilities totaled million as of december  and bear interest at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
sunrise has outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes bear interest at per annum payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the conversion price is  which is equivalent to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are redeemable at the option of sunrise commencing june   at specified premiums 
the holders of the convertible notes may require sunrise to repurchase the notes upon a change of control of sunrise  as defined in the convertible notes 
in may  sunrise entered into a multi property first mortgage loan agreement for million secured by eight properties 
the loan accrues interest at and matures on june  the proceeds were used to reduce the balance of one of sunrise s credit facilities and  as a result  convert a portion of sunrise s variable rate debt into debt with a fixed rate 
at december   million was outstanding 
sunrise has an million excluding a million discount multi property mortgage  collateralized by a blanket first mortgage on all assets of a subsidiary of sunrise  consisting of facilities 
the multi property mortgage consists of two separate debt classes class a in the amount of million bears a fixed interest rate of and is interest only until the maturity date of may   and class b in the amount of million bears a variable interest rate of libor plus and is payable in installments through may as of december   sunrise had various other debt outstanding totaling approximately million  including million of debt assumed through the acquisition of karrington  with interest rates ranging from to sunrise has entered into a swap transaction whereby  effective during the period june  through june   outstanding advances of up to million libor floating rate debt bear interest at a fixed rate based on a fixed libor base rate of 
sunrise has entered into another swap transaction whereby  effective during the period august  through april outstanding advances of up to million under libor floating rate debt bear interest at a fixed libor base rate of 
in november  sunrise settled the million swap transaction 
there was no gain or loss on the settlement 
sunrise recorded net interest expense in  and in the amounts of   and  respectively  for swap transactions 
there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in sunrise s debt instruments  including provisions which require it to meet specified financial tests 
for example  sunrise s million multi property mortgage  which is secured by of its facilities  requires that these facilities maintain a cash flow to interest expense coverage ratio of at least to sunrise s million credit facility requires sunrise to have a consolidated tangible net worth of at least million  to maintain a consolidated minimum cash liquidity balance of at least million and to meet other financial ratios 
these tests are administered on a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the covenant  require consent for changes in management or control of sunrise 
for example  sunrise s million revolving credit facility requires the lender s consent for any merger where paul klaassen or teresa klaassen does not remain chairman of the board and chief executive officer of sunrise  restrict the ability of sunrise subsidiaries to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or engage in mergers or other business combinations without lender consent  and require that sunrise maintain minimum occupancy levels at its facilities to maintain designated levels of borrowings 
for example  sunrise s million credit facility requires that occupancy be achieved after months for a newly opened facility and  following this month period  be maintained at or above that level 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due from net borrowings during the year ended december   an increase in receivables related to management and development contracts from unrelated and related parties and  in conjunction with the karrington acquisition  operating properties  four zoned development sites and one non operating property that are held for sale 
receivables from related parties are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the increase was offset  in part  by sunrise s continued investment in the development and ownership of assisted living facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for and was approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for reflects an increase in sunrise s activities related to the development of unconsolidated joint venture properties 
during and  sunrise used million and million  respectively  for investing activities 
investing activities included investment in property and equipment in the amounts of million and million  respectively  related to the construction of assisted living facilities 
in  sunrise also invested million to facilitate the development of assisted living facilities with third parties  compared to million in these investing activities were offset  in part  by proceeds from the sale of two assisted living facilities in june amounting to million plus million of proceeds from investments and notes receivable 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
financing activities in and included additional borrowings of million and million  respectively  offset  in part  by debt repayments of million and million  respectively 
additional borrowings during included the million loan entered into in may and one of sunrise s credit facilities 
the additional borrowings under sunrise s credit facility during and were used to fund sunrise s continued development of assisted living facilities 
debt repayments during included the use of the proceeds from the million loan to reduce the outstanding balance on one of sunrise s credit facilities 
sunrise currently estimates that the existing credit facilities  together with existing working capital  proceeds from sales of selected real estate assets as a normal part of its operations  financing commitments and financing expected to be available  will be sufficient to fund facilities currently under construction 
additional financing will  however  be required to complete additional development and to refinance existing indebtedness 
sunrise estimates that it will cost between million and million to complete the facilities sunrise currently has under construction 
sunrise has entered into contracts to purchase and lease additional sites 
the total contracted purchase price of these sites is million 
sunrise estimates that it will cost between million and million to develop these properties 
sunrise expects that the cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund the development sites for these additional properties for at least the next six months 
sunrise expects from time to time to seek additional funding through public or private financing sources  including equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing and refinancing will be available on acceptable terms 
the ability of sunrise to achieve its development plans will depend upon a variety of factors  many of which will be outside the control of sunrise 
these factors include obtaining zoning  land use  building  occupancy  licensing and other required governmental permits for the construction of new facilities without experiencing significant delays  completing construction of new facilities on budget and on schedule  the ability to work with third party contractors and subcontractors who construct the facilities  shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive  adverse weather conditions that could delay projects  finding suitable sites for future development activities at acceptable prices  and addressing changes in laws and regulations or how existing laws and regulations are applied 
sunrise cannot assure that it will not experience delays in completing facilities under construction or in development or that it will be able to identify suitable sites at acceptable prices for future development activities 
if it fails to achieve its development plans  its growth could slow  which would adversely impact its revenues and results of operations 
sunrise s growth plan includes the acquisition of assisted living facilities or companies operating assisted living facilities such as karrington 
the success of sunrise s acquisitions will be determined by numerous factors  including the sunrise s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  competition for such acquisitions  the purchase price  the financial performance of the facilities after acquisition and the ability of sunrise to integrate or operate acquired facilities effectively 
any failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on sunrise s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the long term care industry is highly competitive and the assisted living segment is becoming increasingly competitive 
sunrise competes with numerous other companies that provide similar long term care alternatives  such as home health care agencies  facility based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other assisted living providers 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the assisted living industry are not substantial 
in pursuing its growth strategies  sunrise has experienced and expects to continue to experience increased competition in its efforts to develop and acquire assisted living facilities 
some of the present and potential competitors of sunrise are significantly larger and have  or may obtain  greater financial resources than sunrise 
consequently  sunrise cannot assure that it will not encounter increased competition that could limit its ability to attract residents or expand its business  which could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and earnings 
sunrise expects that the number of owned and operated facilities will continue to increase substantially as it pursues its development and acquisition programs for new assisted living facilities 
this rapid growth will place significant demands on sunrise s management resources 
sunrise s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and management information systems and to continue to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
if sunrise is unable to manage its growth effectively  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
sunrise believes that some assisted living markets have become or are on the verge of becoming overbuilt 
as described above  regulation and other barriers to entry into the assisted living industry are not substantial 
consequently  the development of new assisted living facilities could outpace demand 
overbuilding in sunrise market areas could  therefore  cause sunrise to experience decreased occupancy  depressed margins or lower operating results 
sunrise believes that each local market is different and sunrise is and will continue to react in a variety of ways  including selective price discounting  to the specific competitive environment that exists in each market 
market risk sunrise is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its notes receivable  investments and debt 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  sunrise has investments in notes receivable and bonds 
investments in notes receivable are primarily with joint venture arrangements in which sunrise has equity ownership percentages ranging from to 
investments in bonds are secured by the operating properties subject to the debt and are with properties that are managed by sunrise 
the majority of the investments have fixed rates 
one of the notes has an adjustable rate 
sunrise utilizes a combination of debt and equity financing to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
sunrise seeks the financing at the most favorable terms available at the time 
when seeking debt financing  sunrise uses a combination of variable and fixed rate debt  whichever is more favorable in management s judgment at the time of financing 
sunrise has used interest rate swaps to manage the interest rates on some of its long term borrowings 
as of december   sunrise had one interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes fixed rates of on up to million of long term debt until june sunrise does not utilize forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
sunrise generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity without penalty 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until sunrise would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance of million at december  constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the table below details by category the principal amount  the average interest rates and the estimated fair market value 
some of the mortgage loans receivable and some items in the various categories of debt  excluding the convertible debentures  require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to sunrise for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
the fair market value estimate of the convertible notes is based on the market value at december  dollars in thousands estimated maturity date fair market thereafter value assets notes receivable fixed rate      average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate investments bonds   average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate        average interest rate variable rate        average interest rate convertible notes   average interest rate impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sop provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs

sunrise participates in interest rate swap transactions  which would be considered derivatives under statement no 
sunrise has not entered into any other derivative transactions 
to date  the net effect of the interest rate swaps to sunrise s results of operations has not been material 
therefore  statement no 
is not anticipated to affect results of operations or the financial position of sunrise 
impact of inflation resident fees from owned assisted living facilities and management services income from facilities operated by sunrise for third parties are the primary sources of revenue 
these revenues are affected by daily resident fee rates and facility occupancy rates 
the rates charged for the delivery of assisted living services are highly dependent upon local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the facilities operate 
in addition  employee compensation expense is the principal cost element of property operations 
employee compensation  including salary increases and the hiring of additional staff to support sunrise s growth initiatives  have previously had a negative impact on operating margins and may again do so in the foreseeable future 
substantially all of sunrise s resident agreements are for terms of one year  but are terminable by the resident at any time upon days notice  and allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the daily fees payable  and thus may enable sunrise to seek increases in daily fees due to inflation or other factors 
any increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy of sunrise s facilities 
sunrise believes  however  that the short term nature of its resident agreements generally serves to reduce the risk to sunrise of the adverse effect of inflation 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
year issues in prior years  sunrise discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  sunrise experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
sunrise expenditures were approximately million during in connection with upgrading and remediating its systems 
sunrise is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with embedded systems in facilities operated  its internal financial systems  or the products and services of third parties 
sunrise will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
