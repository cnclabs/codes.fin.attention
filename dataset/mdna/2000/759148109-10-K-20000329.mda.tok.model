item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the growth in the company s operating revenue and net earnings during was primarily the result of an increase in staffing weeks worked from  to  the increase in staffing weeks worked was the result of the acquisition of allstaff  new staffing office openings and increased market demand for staffing services 
additionally  an increase in the average number of outpatient clinics from to  plus reduced therapy costs in managed inpatient units contributed to the growth 
the growth for was the result of an increase in the number of acute  subacute and outpatient clinics  and growth from acquisitions 
the results reflect an increase in the average number of inpatient units from to  an increase in the average number of outpatient clinics managed by the company from to  an increase in contract therapy locations from to  and increased nursing weeks worked due to the acquisition of starmed 
the growth for was primarily attributable to an increase in acute and subacute programs plus increased therapy weeks worked at hssi 
in the normal course of business  new programs are opened and some existing programs are closed each year 
during the first year of operation  a new acute rehabilitation program will typically be subject to limitations in reimbursement from medicare considerably below the hospital s operating cost 
as a consequence  during this period the company agrees with the client hospital to bear certain costs on the hospital s behalf and to waive a portion of its fees until the program qualifies for an exemption from medicare limitations 
the company assists the hospital in qualifying the program for the exemption and in minimizing the unreimbursed costs during this non exempt period 
the company s average operating losses during the qualifying period can range to as high as  to  per program 
if the company does not obtain an exemption for the program  the contract may be terminated and  in the event of termination  losses would generally not be recoverable 
upon completion of the qualifying year and obtaining the exemption  the hospital is currently eligible to recover all of its costs related to the operation of the program  including the company s fees under the management contract 
once a program becomes exempt  the program experiences accelerated growth in operating revenues and profitability as the patient population is expanded in response to the more favorable reimbursement terms 
there is no current guidance with respect to the impact of the implementation of rehab pps on this process 
subacute programs and outpatient clinics are not subject to the same qualifying year limitations in reimbursement from medicare as acute rehabilitation programs and  therefore  should result in significantly reduced start up losses per program or clinic

systems were then prioritized from critical to noncritical based upon the potential adverse effect on the financial condition of the company in the event of loss or interruption in the use of each system 
most of the company s systems were purchased from industry known vendors and were generally used in their standard configuration 
other systems were replaced by or converted to year compatible systems
