item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview 
this analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of southern security life should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and financial statements and notes to the financial statements included in this report 
in recent years  the company has primarily issued two types of insurance products universal life and final expense products 
universal life provides insurance coverage with flexible premiums  within limits  which allow policyholders to accumulate cash values 
the accumulated cash values are credited with tax deferred interest  as adjusted by the company on a periodic basis 
deducted from the cash accumulations are administrative charges and mortality costs 
should a policy surrender in its early years  the company assesses a surrender fee against the cash value accumulations based on a graded formula 
final expense products are traditional endowment type insurance policies written for the senior market 
because the products are written to a senior market they are designed to accommodate adverse health conditions 
because of the size of the policies  the products are usually issued with only limited underwriting 
the coverage size of the policy is roughly equivalent to the insured s anticipated funeral costs 
an additional source of income to the company is investment income 
the company invests those funds deposited by policyholders of universal life and annuity products in debt and equity securities in order to earn interest and dividend income  a portion of which is credited back to the policyholders 
interest rates and maturities of the company s investment portfolio play an important part in determining the interest rates credited to policyholders 
product profitability is affected by several different factors  such as mortality experience actual versus expected  interest rate spreads excess interest earned over interest credited to policyholders and controlling policy acquisition costs and other costs of operation 
the results of any one reporting period may be significantly affected by the level of death claims or other policyholder benefits incurred due to the company s relatively small size
