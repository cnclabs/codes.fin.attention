in addition  the company produces and sells sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generant used in automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron tm  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
the perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron tm facilities are located on the company s property in southern utah and the chemicals produced and sold at these facilities collectively represent the company s specialty chemicals operating segment 
the company s other lines of business include the development of real estate in nevada and the production of environmental protection equipment  including waste water and seawater treatment systems 
in  the company entered into the purchase agreement with kerr mcgee 
upon consummation of the acquisition  the company effectively became the sole north american producer of ap 
sales and operating revenues 
sales of the company s perchlorate chemical products  consisting almost entirely of ap sales  accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in general  demand for ap is driven by a relatively small number of dod and nasa contractors 
as a result  any one individual ap customer usually accounts for a significant portion of the revenues of the company 
for example  thiokol accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in addition  alliant accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
sodium azide sales accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
autoliv  the company s principal sodium azide customer  accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of halotron tm amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
halotron tm is designed to replace halon based fire extinguishing systems 
accordingly  demand for halotron tm depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of consumers to switch from halon based systems  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations 
real estate and related sales amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that the company is unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales or recognition of the equity in earnings of real estate ventures 
environmental protection equipment sales accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
cost of sales 
the principal elements comprising the company s cost of sales are raw materials  electric power  labor  manufacturing overhead and the book basis of real estate sold 
the major raw materials used by the company in its production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  nitrous oxide and hcfc significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if the company is unable to pass along such increases to its customers 
prices paid by the company for raw materials have historically been relatively stable  although the company has recently experienced cost increases on certain raw materials  particularly on hcfc and those requiring substantial energy costs to produce 
all the raw materials used in the company s manufacturing processes have been available in commercial quantities  and the company has had no difficulty obtaining necessary raw materials 
a substantial portion of the total costs of operating the company s specialty chemical plants  consisting mostly of labor and overhead  are largely fixed in nature 
the company is in the process of negotiating for its expected power requirements beyond april see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
operating expenses in each of the fiscal years  and include approximately million in costs related to the investigation and evaluation of the trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company is unable to determine the extent to which similar costs will be incurred in the future 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates were approximately during the fiscal years ended september  and  as a result of the establishment of a deferred tax valuation allowance 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in fiscal the company released its deferred tax valuation allowance and recognized the benefits of its net deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
net income loss 
although the company s net income loss and diluted net income loss per common share have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others i as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company  the company may incur material legal and other costs associated with certain litigation and contingencies  ii the timing of real estate and related sales and equity in the earnings of real estate ventures is not predictable  iii the recognition of revenues from environmental protection equipment orders not accounted for as long term contracts depends upon orders generated and the timing of shipment of the equipment  iv weighted average common and common equivalent shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income loss per common share are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the market price of the company s common stock due to outstanding warrants and options  v the results of periodic reviews of impairment issues  and vi the magnitude  pricing and timing of ap  sodium azide  halotron tm  and environmental protection equipment sales in the future is uncertain 
see forward looking statements risk factors below 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  sales and operating revenues 
sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was attributable to decreased specialty chemical and real estate sales 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in environmental protection equipment sales 
specialty chemical sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in perchlorate sales of million and a decrease in sodium azide sales of million 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in halotron tm sales 
halotron sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in halotron tm sales results principally from the company s increased penetration into the clean gas fire extinguishing agent market  particularly the domestic market 
in march  the company received notification from thiokol of a change in the fiscal purchase order for ap that resulted in a decrease of approximately million pounds of ap from million pounds of ap 
the company submitted a price adjustment claim under the change order and  in september  negotiated and settled the claim which resulted in a million payment from thiokol 
the payment has been recognized in revenues of the company s specialty chemical segment which mitigated the impact of the lower ap volumes resulting from the change order 
however  sales volume levels for ap declined from approximately million pounds in fiscal to approximately million pounds in fiscal the company expects sales volumes for ap in fiscal to decrease further to between million and million pounds 
the recent weakness in sales volumes is primarily attributable to lower requirements for applications in certain commercial space launch vehicles used primarily in satellite launches  particularly telecommunication satellites 
in addition  purchases of ap for use in the solid rocket motors for the space shuttle  as evidenced by the change order referred to above  have declined as a result of existing excess inventory levels 
the company believes that such excess should be reduced over the next few years considering the number of shuttle flights planned for the construction and servicing of the international space station 
the company also understands that existing plans call for significant ap requirements over the next several years for use in the minuteman program 
accordingly  the company believes that the estimated future ap requirements for these two programs should bring north american demand for ap back to an annual level of between million and million pounds over the next few years  although there can be no assurance given with respect to these estimates 
the company has no ability to influence north american demand for ap 
the company experienced a decrease in sodium azide sales volumes in fiscal as compared to fiscal although the company expects the worldwide demand for airbag systems to increase  the level of demand for sodium azide will depend upon the penetration of competing inflator technologies that are not based upon the use of sodium azide 
based principally upon market information received from inflator manufacturers  the company expects sodium azide use to continue to decline and that inflators using sodium azide will be phased out over some period of time 
as a result of these market conditions  in fiscal the company recognized an impairment charge of approximately million relating to fixed assets used in the production of sodium azide 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
real estate sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal due to a decrease in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as of october   the company has a backlog of approximately million for deliveries of environmental protection equipment in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to lower specialty chemical sales volumes perchlorates and sodium azide 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of the company s operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the decrease in operating income of the specialty chemicals segment was attributable to the decrease in perchlorate and sodium azide sales and the impairment charge of million discussed above 
the increase in operating income of the environmental protection equipment segment was primarily due to an increase in sales and an unusual charge recognized in fiscal in the amount of approximately million associated with certain warranty items 
the decrease in operating income of the real estate segment was attributable to a decrease in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in the increase was principally due to higher average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the company s repurchase of approximately million in principal amount of notes during fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  sales and operating revenues 
sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to increased specialty chemical and real estate sales 
specialty chemical sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was principally attributable to an increase in perchlorate sales of million 
the increase in perchlorate sales was attributable to a full year of additional ap sales volume resulting from the acquisition 
in addition  sodium azide sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal real estate sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal due to an increase in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales were million in both fiscal and cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies resulting from an increase in specialty chemical sales volumes perchlorates and sodium azide 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in net periodic pension cost of approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company and approximately million in fiscal costs incurred related to the arbitration of the halotron tm agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of the company s operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals   environmental protection equipment   real estate   total   the increase in operating income of the specialty chemicals segment was attributable to the increase in perchlorate sales and operating performance as a result of the acquisition 
the increase in operating loss of the environmental protection equipment segment was primarily due to an unusual charge in the amount of approximately million associated with certain warranty items 
the increase in operating income of the real estate segment was attributable to an increase in revenues from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in the increase was principally due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the issuance of the notes 
inflation inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  as discussed above  the company has recently experienced cost increases on certain of its raw materials and inflation may have an effect on gross profit in the future as a result of potential further increases  and the fact that certain of the company s agreements with ap and sodium azide customers require fixed prices 
however  certain of such agreements contain escalation features that should somewhat mitigate the risks associated with inflation 
liquidity and capital resources as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements of the company  in march  the company sold notes in the principal amount of million  acquired certain assets from kerr mcgee for a cash purchase price of million and paid million to repurchase the remaining million principal amount outstanding of the azide notes 
the company incurred approximately million in costs associated with the issuance of the notes 
in connection with the azide notes repurchase  the company recognized an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million 
since the original issuance of the notes  the company has repurchased and retired approximately million in principal amount of notes and incurred extraordinary losses on these debt extinguishments of approximately million 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal resulted from increased sales and margins in the company s specialty chemical and real estate operations 
the company believes that its cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of its operations  including debt related payments 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for ap  sodium azide and halotron tm  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
capital expenditures were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate principally to specialty chemicals segment capital improvement projects 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and operating cash flow 
during the three year period ended september   the company made debt related payments of approximately million  repurchased million in common stock and issued million in common stock as a result of the exercise of outstanding stock options 
during the three year period ended september   the company received net cash of approximately million from its ventana canyon joint venture 
the company currently anticipates that cash returns of invested capital and equity in earnings will continue through the conclusion of the project currently projected to be near the end of calendar as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company  the company has incurred legal and other costs  and it may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
any such costs  to the extent borne by the company and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect the company s liquidity 
the company is currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs or the period of time over which such costs will be incurred
