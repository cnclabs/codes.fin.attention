item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative expense 
operating income interest expense net income net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to approximately  compared with  in this decrease is the result of several offsetting factors 
first  the company closed the transaction with caterpillar in january the company spent much of transitioning from its mostly independent dealer network to the caterpillar dealer network 
based on the success the company had selling to caterpillar dealers in prior years  it was felt the transition to additional caterpillar dealers would be a relatively simple process 
however  the degree to which these additional caterpillar dealers embraced new products  such as asv s posi track  varied greatly 
this required increased training and market development activity by both the company and the dealers to get the necessary marketing programs and other support in place 
during this time period  sales decreased 
second  in  the company introduced a new model posi track  the  that incorporated many caterpillar components 
the initial production of the was later than anticipated due to delays encountered during the initial production process  leading to decreased sales during primarily the third quarter of offsetting these two factors was in an increase in sales of approximately million relating to posi track machines sold under military contracts 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to approximately  compared with  in the increase can be attributed to a combination of several factors 
first  the company expanded its network of posi track dealers in prior to the announcement of the transaction with caterpillar in october  the company had approximately dealer locations able to distribute its posi track products compared with at march second  was the first full year of sales for the company s hd series posi track which accounted for approximately of all units shipped in sales of the hd series began in the third quarter of third  the company introduced the md series in the third quarter of  which accounted for approximately of all units shipped in the company believes the two additional model posi tracks available for sale in and the maintenance free undercarriage found on these models were responsible for the sales decrease of the md posi track in fourth  the posi track model dx was available for the full year in sales of the posi track dx increased approximately over conversely  sales of the company s track truck decreased approximately as customers purchased the dx instead of the track truck 
lastly  sales of service parts increased in as the number of machines in service continues to increase 
also  sales of used equipment increased in as the company has been able to increase its used equipment offerings and devote additional marketing efforts towards its sale 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  for this decrease is a result of decreased sales in as discussed above and a decrease in the company s gross profit percentage from in to in the decreased gross profit percentage is due to several factors 
first  as discussed above  the company experienced delays resulting in production inefficiencies during its initial start up of production for the during the third quarter of second  the military contract discussed above had a significantly lower gross profit percentage than the company s typical sales to its dealers 
this was due to the high subcontract costs on this military contract 
also  the company experienced increased warranty costs as a percentage of net sales  mainly from earlier model machines  which were not fully recovered from its vendors 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately  or of net sales  compared with approximately  or of net sales in the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in the company s net sales for the gross profit percentage change was due to an increase resulting from the sale of models with higher gross margins more than offset by an increase in warranty expense and two additional factors 
first  the company incurred initial start up production costs related to its model series posi track  primarily during the fourth quarter  as manufacturing changes were made to improve the overall product 
second  the company experienced less retail sales as a percentage of its total net sales in  thereby reducing its overall gross profit margin  as more of its product was sold through its dealer network in compared with selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased from of net sales in to of net sales in the increased level of expenses was due to several factors 
first  the company began paying a commission to caterpillar for sales to its dealers in  which accounted for approximately of the increase 
second  the company increased its marketing efforts to assist in the transition of selling to caterpillar dealers 
these marketing efforts included increased start up  training and market development costs  as well as additional sales and support personnel hired to service the dealers added in in addition  the company integrated its computer system with caterpillar s to allow caterpillar dealers to place orders for whole machines and parts and process warranty claims in a similar fashion as they do with caterpillar 
the increased expenses combined with the decreased sales caused an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses when expressed as a percentage of net sales 
the company anticipates its selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as the company s net sales increase 
for the twelve months ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  however  these expenses decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in the increase in the expenses is due to increased sales and marketing efforts and increased administrative costs from increased employment levels 
the increased sales and marketing costs are primarily from additional sales personnel hired in and increased advertising and promotion expenditures to expand the company s dealer network 
the decreased percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses is due to the company closely managing its costs as sales volume increases 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately  to  the increase is due primarily to the introduction of the model posi track  continued work on the company s new smaller machine and enhancements to the existing posi track models 
for the twelve months ended december   research and development expenses increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase is due primarily to the introduction of the series posi track in and enhancements to existing posi track models 
in order to maintain its competitive advantage over other manufacturers of similar products  the company believes it will increase the level of spending on research and development activities 
it is expected the main thrust of these activities will be directed towards extensions of the company s current product lines and improvements of existing products 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  or of net sales  in compared with  or of net sales  in and  or of net sales  in the decrease in is the combination of two offsetting factors 
interest expense decreased in as the company s convertible debentures were exchanged for common stock in offsetting this decrease was an increase in borrowings under the company s line of credit during the increased interest expense in was due to the expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities and the related debt thereon 
in addition  in connection with the exchange by the holders of the company s convertible debentures in the fourth quarter of  the company paid one additional quarter of interest to those who exchanged their debentures for common stock 
this amount represented approximately  of additional interest expense in net income 
for the year ended december   net income decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  in this decrease was due to decreased sales with a lower gross profit and increased operating expenses  offset in part by lower interest expense 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase was due to increased sales and profitability on those sales  offset  in part  by increased operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s working capital increased  to approximately  the primary reason for the increase was the company s transaction with caterpillar  which resulted in an immediate increase in working capital of million 
the company utilized the proceeds from the transaction initially to pay off advances under its line of credit and to fund current operations 
inventory levels increased compared with december  due to several reasons 
during the transition to caterpillar dealers  the company chose not to reduce its production levels  but instead  increased its finished goods  primarily its series posi tracks 
the company is in the process of marketing these finished units to its current dealers  as well as additional international caterpillar dealers 
other reasons for the inventory increase include the general increase in inventory needed to begin production of the new model posi track  the long lead times to purchase certain inventory items  and the need to inventory service parts for older model machines that are in the field 
in addition  as the company transitioned from independent dealers to caterpillar dealers  the company chose to repurchase the inventory held by the independent dealers 
to the extent possible  this inventory was transferred to the new caterpillar dealer 
any inventory not transferred was brought to the company s facilities and accounted for the majority of the million increase in used equipment held for resale 
the company anticipates it will be able to reduce its inventory levels in current liabilities decreased slightly from  with the company s line of credit borrowings increasing to fund current operations and accounts payable decreasing as the company reduced its purchasing volume in the fourth quarter of accrued commission increased in with the closing of the transaction with caterpillar 
at december   the company s working capital increased to approximately  from approximately  at december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels  offset  in part  by increases in accounts payable and borrowings on the company s line of credit 
the company s sales during the fourth quarter of were approximately  less than the third quarter of  due to dealer transition matters related to the caterpillar transaction 
during the fourth quarter  the company chose not to reduce its production levels  but instead  increased its finished goods 
this decision  along with the overall increase in the company s business activity  caused inventory levels to increase from accounts receivable increased as more of the company s sales occurred in december in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter with the decrease in fourth quarter sales  the company began drawing on its line of credit  with the outstanding advances under the line totaling  at december  with the increase in the company s overall volume  accounts payable increased approximately  or  at december  due to the exercise of certain stock options in the latter half of  the company had no liability for income taxes at december  in addition  the current portion of long term liabilities increased approximately  due to the additional debt incurred for the company s facility expansion and the acquisition of land and buildings for storage and to house the company s research and development activities since the closing of the transaction with caterpillar on january   the company has been working closely with caterpillar and its dealers to introduce the company s products to those caterpillar dealers not currently selling and servicing the posi track product line 
the company spent much of meeting with potential caterpillar dealers and educating them on the benefits of a rubber tracked machine 
the company also put in place many systems that it believes will help caterpillar dealers interface with the company 
in september  the company s computer systems were integrated with caterpillar s computer systems 
this allows caterpillar dealers to order machines  attachments  parts and process warranty claims on line in a manner similar to how they perform these tasks with caterpillar factories 
as of march   caterpillar dealers and independent dealers representing over locations in the united states  canada and australia sell and service the company s machines 
the company anticipates it will expand further into australia  canada and central and south america in in june  the company introduced a new smaller concept machine  intended for the landscape and homeowner markets 
weighing approximately  pounds  this machine is significantly smaller than any of the company s previous models 
the company intends to build its first production run of this machine in the second quarter of at its grand rapids facility 
the raw materials for this machine will be purchased from many of the same suppliers the company is currently using for its other products 
the machine is expected to be sold through multiple distribution channels and will have a retail price of approximately  on september   the company s warranty policy changed with respect to all machines sold after that date 
this was accomplished at the same time as the integration of the company s computer system with caterpillar s computer system to allow caterpillar dealers to process warranty claims on line  eliminating the need to file paper warranty claims 
the changes in the company s warranty policy include the elimination of reimbursing dealers labor relating to warranty repairs  eliminating travel costs relating to warranty repairs and the elimination of the warranty discount provided on parts used in warranty repairs 
in addition  should a caterpillar manufactured part  such as an engine  fail during the warranty period  caterpillar is responsible for providing the warranty on that part 
the company believes the change to its warranty policy will reduce its warranty expense in the future 
as a result of the transaction  the company s near term revenues  profitability and other financial results are expected to be lower than if the transaction were not announced or entered into 
the decline is related to a number of factors  including i the commission to be paid to caterpillar for sales made to caterpillar dealers  ii transition issues affecting orders from the preexisting non caterpillar affiliated dealers  and iii certain other costs of implementing the transaction and the agreements contemplated by the commercial alliance agreement 
over the longer term  however  management believes that the company will be able to achieve improved financial results due to the transaction and the commercial alliance agreement 
the company believes its existing cash and marketable securities  together with cash expected to be provided by operations and available  unused credit lines  will satisfy the company s projected working capital needs and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months
