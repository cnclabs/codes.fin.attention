prospective and current investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements as well as the future prospects of the company generally  such investors should specifically consider various factors identified in this report on form k  including the matters set forth therein under the caption factors that may affect operating results  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may affect the company s results of operations include but are not limited to the company s limited operating history and cumulative losses  anticipated fluctuations in operating results and seasonal sales  dependence on limited products  uncertain market acceptance of planned products  uncertainty regarding our ability to enter into oem agreements  rapid technological change  dependence on new product introductions  competition  dependence on a limited number of customers  dependence on contract manufacturing and sole or limited source suppliers  substantial influence of principal stockholder  dependence on key personnel  management of growth  anticipated fluctuations in operating results  dependence on proprietary technology  success in defending significant litigation  shares eligible for future sale  possible volatility of stock price  factors inhibiting takeover  potential year problems and government regulations 
the company participates in a highly concentrated industry  and has limited visibility with regard to customer orders and the timing of such orders 
the company may also encounter difficulty obtaining sufficient supplies to staff and meet production schedules 
as a result  quarter to quarter and year to year financial performance is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of orders from its customers during fiscal periods 
overview digital lightwave designs  develops  markets and supports diagnostic products that monitor  maintain and manage fiber optic based networks 
the company s products provide telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers with capabilities to cost effectively deploy and manage fiber optic networks to address the rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth 
from inception in through  the company focused its primary activities on developing the necessary technology and infrastructure required to launch its first product  the network information computer 
the company had no sales until february  when it began shipping the network information computer 
as of december   the company had sold approximately  network information computers to approximately customers such as mci worldcom  ameritech corporation  tellabs  qwest  gte and level communications 
in  the company commenced limited sales of the network access agent 
net sales for the company were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products  less an estimate for customer returns 
net sales are recognized when products are shipped to a customer 
the average sales price asp of the network information computer gross of the return accrual was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average sales price asp of the network access agent gross of the return accrual was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects that the asp of its network information computers and network access agents will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the asp may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company sells its products through a direct sales force to telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers 
the sales cycle for new customers tends to be long 
in addition  the telecommunications industry historically has had a limited number of competitors 
given long sales cycles and few industry participants  sales of the company s products have tended to be concentrated  and the company expects that sales will continue to be concentrated in the future 
for the year ended december   the company s two largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues  with telogy and technology rental services trs  formerly  newcourt financial accounting for approximately and of total sales  respectively 
the company believes that a significant portion of the equipment purchased by telogy and trs is deployed at nortel networks 
for the year ended december   sales to the company s four largest customers comprised of its total revenues  with qwest  mci worldcom  tellabs  and gte accounting for approximately   and of total sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company s five largest customers comprised of total revenues  with worldcom  inc prior to its acquisition of mci communications corporation and its subsidiaries accounting for of total sales 
no other customers accounted for sales of or more during such periods 
many of the customers highlighted in years prior to as accounting for more than continued to purchase at similar dollar levels in although they did not surpass the threshold for this year 
there can be no assurance regarding the amount or timing of purchases by any customer in any future period 
see factors that may affect operating results we are dependent on a limited number of major customers 
in may  the company signed an original equipment manufacturer contract to provide integrated performance monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for a product marketed by lucent technologies  inc lucent s placement of orders for product is conditional upon the company achieving certain milestone events defined in the contract 
in january  the company announced that it had received an order for four waveagents from lucent for the initiation of customer lab trails 
to date  the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products  but generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment and other cancelable purchase commitments 
as a result  the company does not expect to carry substantial quarterly backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s sales during a particular quarter are  therefore  highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during the quarter 
consequently  sales may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and amount of orders from customers  among other factors 
because most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced in response to decreased revenues  quarterly fluctuations in sales have a significant effect on net income 
since inception the company had incurred substantial net operating losses as a result of significant investment in research and development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses until the quarter ended june  when the company showed its first profitable quarter 
profitability was sustained through the end of with earnings of approximately million on a year to date basis 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for tax purposes 
the company intends to continue to build its organization in anticipation of growth and believes that its operating expenses will continue to increase accordingly due to a variety of factors including increased research and development expenses associated with the completion of the products in development and the continued enhancement of existing products  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses associated with continued expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  product advertising and promotion 
there can be no assurance that the company will sustain profitability

a committee consisting of the outside members of the company s board of directors was established to review the policies  procedures and circumstances which may have been factors in the restatement of revenue and made recommendations regarding the adoption of appropriate revenue recognition policies and procedures 
in april  class action lawsuits which were subsequently consolidated into a single action were filed against the company arising out of such restatement and alleged violations of the federal securities laws 
the company settled the class action and recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of as a result of the settlement

during february  the company entered into a stock purchase option the option with a former stockholder to repurchase the  shares of the then outstanding class of common stock held by the former stockholder for a purchase price of million

we believe that we have fulfilled our obligations under the settlement agreement and that the claims made by the plaintiff against us in this action are without merit 
accordingly  in response to this action  we filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim against digital lightwave 
however  there can be no assurance that our motion will be granted  or if the motion is denied  that we will succeed in defending or settling this action
