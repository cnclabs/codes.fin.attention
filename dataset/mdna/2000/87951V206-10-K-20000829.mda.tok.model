the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview teletouch is a leading provider of wireless telecommunications services  primarily paging services  in non major metropolitan areas and communities in the southeast united states 
as of may   the company had approximately  pagers in service 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic fees  not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
as long as a subscriber remains on service  operating results benefit from the recurring payments of the fixed  periodic fees without incurring additional selling expenses or other fixed costs 
due to the growth from the completion of acquisitions in previous years  teletouch s results of operations for prior periods may not be indicative of future performance 
acquisitions and disposals on march   teletouch acquired substantially all the assets of eastex communications  inc for consideration of approximately  an initial payment of approximately  was paid in cash  and the remaining consideration will be paid in equal monthly installments over the next two years 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the total purchase price was allocated as follows  to property  plant  and equipment   to inventory   to fcc licenses   to subscriber bases   to a non compete agreement  and the remaining amount to goodwill 
the results of operations of the acquisition  which are immaterial to consolidated operations  are included with that of the company from the date of closing 
on december   teletouch concluded its purchase of certain fcc licenses from gte for consideration of million 
total purchase price was million 
on january   teletouch sold substantially all of its communications towers for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
concurrent with the sale  the company leased space on the towers sold for a period of ten years for approximately million per year 
teletouch recognized a million gain related to the sale of the towers in fiscal and deferred the remaining million gain  which is being amortized into income over the period of the lease 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended may    and total revenue teletouch s total revenue increased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the fiscal year total revenue increase was due to approximately million additional revenues from cellular products and an increase in paging service revenue resulting from internal growth 
the fiscal year increase over fiscal was a combination of approximately million in additional revenues from cellular products  million in additional revenues from one time two way radio contracts  and the remainder from an increase in pagers in service resulting from internal growth 
pagers in service increased to  at may  as compared to  and  at may  and  respectively 
the positive impact on total revenue of the increase in pagers in service is partially offset by the decline in average revenue per unit arpu 
arpu for the year ended may  was as compared to and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
the decrease in arpu is primarily due to increased competition in the company s markets and an increase in the percentage of the company s subscriber base represented by resellers 
resellers are businesses that buy airtime at wholesale prices from teletouch and sell the service to end users 
while the wholesale price to a reseller is lower than the price the company charges to its other customers  a reseller bears the cost of acquiring  billing  collecting and servicing its subscribers 
at may  approximately of the company s subscriber base was represented by resellers as opposed to at may  and at may  as competitors continue to pursue its customers in the marketplace and as the percentage of its subscriber base represented by resellers increases  arpu will continue to decline 
nevertheless  teletouch expects that the growth of paging units in service and the introduction of new products and services will increase sufficiently to offset any decline in arpu and not result in a decrease in total revenue 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  were million  of total revenue  for fiscal year as compared to million  of total revenue  and million  of total revenue  for the fiscal years and  respectively 
costs increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily because of new retail store openings  particularly in the areas of payroll  rent  and advertising expenses 
these costs are expected to decrease as a percentage of sales as the new stores begin to experience positive operating results 
however  as long as the company continues to open new stores  operating expenses may increase slightly as a percent of sales 
additionally  due to the restructure of certain administrative collection functions in may  bad debt losses for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal however  the company has implemented new procedures that have lowered bad debt losses for the last half of fiscal costs increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily because of new retail store openings  tower lease expenses related to the sale of previously owned towers  and the cost of restructuring that occurred in may  resulting in million of non recurring costs 
payroll expenses  sales commissions  office and tower leases  and network costs represented the most significant line item increases in fiscal operating costs as a percentage of total revenue have either decreased or remained flat as the company s customer base has grown sufficiently to generate revenues at rates that have absorbed the increased costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in fiscal year from million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
a decrease in amortization expense in fiscal of approximately million due to the expiration of amortization on certain acquired intangible assets and a decrease in additional depreciation recorded on returned lease pagers of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in depreciation on other assets of million  accounted for the decrease from fiscal additional depreciation recorded on returned lease pagers accounted for most of the increase in fiscal over fiscal teletouch s emphasis on selling rather than leasing pagers has stabilized this expense 
interest expense net interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal  which decreased from million in fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest charges associated with the junior subordinated notes discussed below under financial condition  partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of debt issue costs 
the decrease in long term debt under the credit agreement also discussed below under financial condition combined with lower interest rates were the primary factors contributing to lower interest costs in fiscal over fiscal these factors  however  were partially offset by increased amortization of financing costs associated with the credit agreement 
income tax benefit at may  teletouch had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that will begin to expire in fiscal for fiscal year the company estimates that no tax benefit will be recorded 
a valuation allowance has been recorded against deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized 
specifically  the company s carryforwards expire at specific future dates  and utilization of certain carryforwards is limited to specific amounts each year 
however  due to the uncertain nature of their ultimate realization  teletouch has established a valuation allowance against these carryforward benefits and will recognize benefits only as reassessment demonstrates they are realizable 
realization is entirely dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions 
while the need for this valuation allowance is subject to periodic review  if the allowance is reduced  the tax benefit of the carryforwards will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of the company s income tax expense 
ebitda ebitda decreased to million  of total revenue in fiscal year as compared to million  of total revenue million  of total revenue  including the million of costs associated with the restructuring  in fiscal year and million  of total revenue million  of total revenue  including the million of costs associated with a terminated acquisition  in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal ebitda as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal is primarily due to new retail store openings and increased bad debt losses  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of total revenue  ebitda did not increase in fiscal because new retail store openings  increased tower lease expenses due to the sale leaseback transaction  and restructuring costs caused expenses to grow slightly faster than revenues 
financial condition teletouch s cash balance was million at may  as compared to million at may  cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal  which increased from million in fiscal year the company expects that cash flow provided from operations will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs in the near term 
teletouch may  however  use funds available under the credit agreement discussed below to fund future acquisitions  if any 
on january   teletouch sold substantially all of its communications towers for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
concurrent with the sale  the company leased space on the towers sold for a period of ten years for approximately million per year 
teletouch recognized a million gain related to the sale of the towers in fiscal and deferred the remaining million gain  which is being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease 
teletouch s operations require capital investment to purchase pagers for lease to customers and to acquire paging infrastructure equipment to support the company s growth 
net capital expenditures  including pagers  amounted to million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in both fiscal years were primarily in capital investments in new retail stores  leased pagers  and the addition of new transmitter sites 
teletouch anticipates capital expenditures will be flat in fiscal as the company continues to open new retail stores  improve its infrastructure  and meet its subscribers pager needs 
teletouch will pay for these expenditures with cash generated from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the unused portion of the credit agreement discussed below 
the company s credit agreement provides for loans in an amount not to exceed million 
as of may    of the credit agreement was funded  and million is available for future funding 
direct costs incurred in connection with obtaining the credit agreement of approximately million have been deferred and are being amortized  using the effective interest rate method  over the term of the existing loans 
the credit agreement bears interest  at the company s designation  at a floating rate of the prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
these rates vary depending on the leverage ratio of the company 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of teletouch and its subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit agreement require the principal be repaid in escalating quarterly installments beginning in august and ending in november for fiscal  the weighted average interest rate on the credit agreement was 
the credit agreement also requires the maintenance of specified financial and operating covenants  with which teletouch is in compliance at may   and prohibits any payments on the junior subordinated notes and the payment of dividends 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting guidelines for derivatives and requires companies to record all derivatives as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
additionally  this statement establishes accounting treatment for three types of hedges hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments  hedges of the variable cash flows of forecasted transactions  and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
any derivative that qualifies as a hedge  depending upon the nature of that hedge  will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after june  teletouch is currently analyzing the implementation requirements and does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab provides additional guidance on the accounting for revenue recognition  including both broad conceptual discussions as well as certain industry specific guidance 
the guidance is effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal while teletouch does not expect sab no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations upon adoption  the sec is expected to issue further guidance regarding the implementation of sab no 
which could affect the company s estimates of its expected impact 
impact of year teletouch has experienced no significant issues with respect to year however  the company is continuing to monitor its systems to insure that any issues that might arise are addressed immediately 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in teletouch s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of its total long term obligations as of may  if interest rates average one percent more in fiscal than they did during fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate long term obligations as of may  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not  however  consider the effects that such changes in interest rates may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions the company may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ from the above analysis
