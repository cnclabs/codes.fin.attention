we intend to continue to expand the number of company owned and franchised restaurants

additionally  we began a share repurchase program in capital expenditures of million  acquisitions of million  loans to franchisees of million and share repurchases of million for  were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  cash generated from the exercise of stock options and the liquidation of available cash and investments 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  primarily for the development or relocation of restaurants  construction of commissary facilities  and the completion of the louisville corporate offices 
during  we plan to open approximately new company owned restaurants and relocate an additional to restaurants 
in addition to restaurant development and potential acquisitions  significant capital projects for the next months are expected to include the completion of the  square foot commissary and corporate office facility in louisville  kentucky 
in mid  the louisville commissary operations and the majority of the team members in the corporate offices were relocated to the new facility  which is expected to be completed in early a full service commissary was opened in pittsburgh  pennsylvania in january  and we expect to complete the expansion and relocation of the phoenix  arizona distribution center to a full service commissary in mid subsequent to year end  we acquired an additional million of common stock under our share repurchase program 
these purchases have primarily been funded with short term bank financing 
the board of directors has authorized up to million for the share repurchase program through year end  and million remains available under this authorization 
also subsequent to year end  we acquired pjnj foods  inc  a franchisee of papa john s restaurants in new jersey  for million million in cash and million of assumed net liabilities 
through december  we earned approximately million of an expected million in incentives under the kentucky jobs development act in connection with the relocation of the corporate offices

approximately million was outstanding under this program as of december  at this time  we do not expect to significantly expand the program beyond existing commitments 
substantially all capital resources available at december  were expended in connection with the million share repurchase subsequent to year end 
total bank financing of approximately million has been utilized to complete these subsequent repurchases 
we expect to fund repayment of short term bank financing  planned capital expenditures  acquisitions of franchised restaurants  disbursements under the franchise loan program and additional share repurchases for the next twelve months from operating cash flows and the million remaining borrowing capacity under a million  three year  unsecured revolving line of credit agreement entered into in march impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed testing of our systems and made modifications as deemed necessary 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in business critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe these systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the costs incurred during in connection with necessary modifications of our systems were not material to our financial position 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues regarding our internal systems  the products and services of third parties  or the businesses operated by our franchisees 
we will continue to monitor our business critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and franchisees throughout the year to ensure that any year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly labor  benefits  food and fuel costs  could have a significant impact on us 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  our ability and the ability of our franchisees to obtain suitable locations and financing for new restaurant development  the hiring  training  and retention of management and other personnel  competition in the industry with respect to price  service  location  and food quality  an increase in food cost due to seasonal fluctuations  weather  and demand  changes in consumer tastes and demographic trends  changes in federal and state laws  such as increases in minimum wage  and risks inherent to international development  including operational or market risks associated with the planned conversion of perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s in the united kingdom 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no significant holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  our principal exposure to financial market risks in the past has been the impact that interest rate changes could have on the income from our investment portfolio 
going forward  our principal exposure is the impact that interest rate changes could have on the interest expense incurred on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all such borrowings none at december  bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate libor  or certain alternative short term rates 
a change in interest rates of basis points would not significantly affect our net income 
furthermore  in connection with our million  three year revolving credit agreement  we entered into a million  three year interest rate collar effective march  the collar establishes a floor and ceiling on the libor base rate on a no fee basis 
substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on us  and are not expected to during cheese  representing approximately of our food cost  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
effective december   the commissary entered into a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity formed at the direction of the franchise advisory council for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility 
under this arrangement  the commissary will purchase cheese at a fixed quarterly price based  in part  on historical average cheese prices 
gains and losses incurred by the selling entity will be passed to the commissary via adjustments to the selling price over time 
ultimately the commissary will purchase cheese at a price approximating the actual average market price  but with more predictability and less volatility than the previous purchasing method
