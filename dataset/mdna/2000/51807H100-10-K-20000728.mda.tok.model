item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information  statements relating to laservision s plan  objectives and future performance are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations 
because of various risks and uncertainties discussed below  actual strategies and results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected 
the discussion set forth below analyzes certain factors and trends related to the financial results for each of the three years ended april   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table breaks out revenue by source 
this table also includes net revenue contribution 
net revenue contribution is revenue less license fees paid to laser manufacturers and amounts paid to eye surgeons and optometrists for professional medical services rendered at our fixed laser sites 
management believes that net revenue contribution provides relevant and useful information to investors because it reflects the dollars available to cover laservision s fixed and variable costs after excluding variable costs which laservision pays to third parties 
net revenue contribution should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit  operating income and net income as a measure of profitability 
finally  the table includes certain profitability amounts as a percentage of total revenue and net revenue contribution

selling stockholders sold an additional  shares of which  shares were sold pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants 
 of the shares sold by selling stockholders were sold pursuant to the underwriter s exercise of their overallotment option 
the exercise of these warrants and options resulted in additional proceeds to laservision of million 
on february   visx  the manufacturer of most of the lasers owned by laservision  announced a new program for its customers  including laservision  that included a change in the royalty fee charged by visx from per procedure to per procedure 
most other laser manufacturers  except for nidek  have similar royalties 
along with this pricing change visx announced that it will no longer provide procedure cards for enhancements at no charge  nor will they provide credits for procedure cards used for past enhancements or ambassadors 
an enhancement is a procedure subsequent to the initial treatment that is performed to improve the surgical result 
an ambassador is a patient who is treated at no charge and is frequently a celebrity or a member of a surgeon s practice 
in addition  visx will not exchange the inventory of procedure cards held by laservision at a cost of per procedure card for procedure cards at the reduced cost of accordingly  laservision has recorded a one time charge of approximately million in the year ended april  for actual and estimated expenses related to enhancements and ambassadors and reductions in inventory value  which will not be reimbursed by visx and which laservision does not expect to collect from its customers without legal assistance 
approximately of this million expense was related to enhancement and ambassador procedures which were performed before visx reduced its royalty 
visx has refused to credit laservision for the prepaid royalty and card costs associated with these procedures 
documentation for enhancements was accumulated each month in order for credits to be processed more efficiently in bulk rather than individually as enhancements were performed 
because of the logistics involved with collecting the documentation required by visx for each enhancement from more than surgeons performing procedures on more than lasers at more than locations  there could be a lag time of about five months between the time an enhancement procedure was performed and the time credit was received from visx 
the balance of this expense relates to several inventory issues associated with procedure cards and spare parts 
future revenue and gross profit after march  the visx program change will reduce laservision s domestic refractive revenue per procedure and the royalty cost of revenue per procedure 
other aspects of this new program reduce volume related incentives to laservision and will increase cost of revenue  other than royalty fees  above the levels recorded in calendar  as described in following sections 
although the net effect of this program change upon gross profit per procedure is expected to be unfavorable  any global fee decreases for patients are expected to have a favorable effect upon volume due to price elasticity 
the effect upon total gross profit in future periods will be dependent upon  among other things volume changes  the mix between mobile and fixed sites  and the number and type of new contractual relationships with ophthalmic surgeons 
future operating expenses future contractual relationships with ophthalmic surgeons are expected to increase laservision s portion of both the global fee paid by patients and the total operating costs associated with providing the procedure 
after a start up period of up to four months  management expects the additional benefits to exceed the additional expenses 
rsr revenues for september through april are included in north american refractive revenues 
mss revenues for december through april are shown as cataract revenues 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  laservision has continued to provide excimer laser access to additional sites throughout the us we are focused on establishing long term relationships with our customers and providing value added services through our partnership and market development models 
the acquisition of rsr on september  has enabled us to provide microkeratome access and the acquisition of mss on december  has allowed us to provide mobile cataract services 
revenue 
total revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  total laser procedures increased by to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the increase in revenue was attributable to a million increase in north american refractive revenue  a million increase in other refractive revenue and million in cataract revenue 
the increase in north american revenue was attributable to an increase both in the number of us lasers in operation and the number of procedures performed by our eye surgeon customers in the us the increase in cataract revenue was attributable to having an entire year of revenue in the year ended april  compared to five months of revenue in the year ended april  as well as an increase of more than  procedures performed during the five months ended april  compared to the five months ended april  these procedures were performed on five incremental mobile cataract units during the year ended april costs of revenue gross profit 
costs of revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to an increase of million in total domestic royalties  an increase of million in mobile laser engineer salaries and travel costs  an increase of million in professional medical services costs  an increase of million in depreciation  an increase of million in gases  medical supplies and maintenance  and million of costs related to the cataract business for which a full year of results are reflected in fiscal versus only five months in fiscal the increases in royalty expenses  salaries and travel  professional medical services  depreciation and gasses  medical supplies and maintenance are primarily due to increased refractive procedure volume utilizing an increased number of lasers 
total gross profit increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the variable gross profit  excluding depreciation  increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to higher volumes of procedures performed with our equipment at an increased number of sites 
as a percentage of total revenue  total gross profit decreased to from for the years ended april  and  respectively 
this decline is primarily due to lower average sales prices of about per procedure for the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the increase was attributed to increased operating expenses of million related to a full year of activity for the cataract business  an increase in salaries and related expenses of million  increased general and administrative expenses of million  and increased selling and marketing expenses of million 
the million increase in salaries and related expenses was attributed to more employees  annual raises and variable compensation based on operating results 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was attributed to increased professional fees of million  and increased office expenses of million and increased travel and related costs of million 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses was attributed to supporting more eye surgeons in their marketing programs 
vendor program change expense 
as previously described  a million vendor program change expense was recorded during the year ended april  income from operations 
the income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended april  from million during the year ended april   which reflects the factors discussed above 
other income expense 
higher minority interest in net income of subsidiaries offset by higher interest income caused a million increase to a net million in other income during the year ended april  from a net  in other expense during the year ended april  this was primarily due to interest income on the proceeds from the secondary stock offering in may which were invested in commercial paper and short term government debt instruments during fiscal year income taxes 
income tax benefit increased by million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this increase is attributable to releasing the majority of the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets generated from operations 
in the future we expect income tax expense to be approximately of net income before taxes 
net income 
net income increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  which reflects the factors discussed above 
earnings per share basic increased by per share to per share for the year ended april  from per share for the year ended april  earnings per share diluted increased by per share to per share for the year ended april  from per share for the year ended april  fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
total revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  total laser procedures increased by to  for the year ended april  from  for the year ended april  the increase in revenue was attributable to a million increase in domestic refractive revenue  a million increase in marketing and training revenue and million in cataract revenue 
the increase in north american revenue was attributable to an increase both in the number of us lasers in operation and the number of procedures performed by our eye surgeon customers on each laser in the us costs of revenue gross profit 
costs of revenue increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to an increase of million in total domestic royalties  an increase of million in mobile laser engineer salaries and travel costs  an increase of million in professional medical services costs  an increase of million in gasses  medical supplies and maintenance  and million of costs related to the cataract business 
the increases in royalty expenses  salaries and travel  professional medical services  and gasses  medical supplies and maintenance are primarily due to increased refractive procedure volume 
the increase in costs related to the cataract business was attributed to the acquisition of mss in december total gross profit increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the variable gross profit  excluding depreciation  increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  this was primarily due to higher volumes of procedures performed with our equipment at an increased number of sites 
as a percentage of total revenue  total gross profit increased to from for the years ended april  and  respectively 
this improvement is due to performing more procedures per laser  thus improving utilization of our fixed assets 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  new operating expenses related to the cataract business of million along with increases in salaries and related expenses of million were partially offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses of million 
the million increase in salaries and related expenses was attributed to more employees  annual raises and variable compensation based on operating results 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses was attributed to decreased insurance of  and decreased professional fees of  income loss from operations 
the income loss from operations increased by million to million for the year ended april  from a loss of million during the year ended april   which reflects the factors discussed above 
other income expense 
higher interest expense and minority interest in net income of subsidiary partially offset by higher interest income caused a or  increase to a net  in other expense during the year ended april  from a net  in other expense during the year ended april  this was primarily due to interest expense from the rsr and mss acquisitions 
income taxes 
a million income tax benefit was recorded for the first time during the year ended april  this benefit was attributable to releasing a portion of the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets generated from operations 
net income loss 
net income for the year ended april  was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended april  which reflects the factors discussed above 
earnings per share basic increased by per share to per share for the year ended april  from a loss of per share for the year ended april  earnings per share diluted increased by per share to per share for the year ended april  from a loss of per share for the year ended april  inflation laservision s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources laservision s primary sources of liquidity for the next year are expected to consist of cash generated by operations  vendor financing  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  and proceeds from the secondary stock offering completed on may  we believe this will be sufficient to fund our expected cash needs as described below for the forseeable future  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we have generated positive cash flow from operations for every quarter since the quarter ended april  we expect that normal ongoing liquidity needs  other than investment spending  will continue to be covered substantially from the operations of the business 
laservision has access to vendor financing on one brand of laser 
we expect to continue to have access to this financing option for at least the next nine months 
other equipment vendors do not provide equipment financing 
laservision expects that option and warrant holders will exercise options and warrants prior to their expiration  but we cannot predict when such exercises will occur 
our principal cash needs include normal operating expenses  the purchase of additional equipment  the payments of contingent consideration for mss  and any cash needs for any future acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  laservision repurchased or million shares of the outstanding common stock for approximately million 
in may  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional of the common stock 
treasury stock  which is carried at cost  has been repurchased to meet laservision s obligations under its stock option plans and other stock based plans  while minimizing dilution to shareholders 
our normal operating expenses include procedure royalty fees  salaries  travel and lodging  medical supplies  equipment maintenance  professional fees  rent and utilities 
we expect to purchase about million of new equipment in fiscal year as noted above  we have available vendor financing for the purchase price of one brand of excimer laser 
lasers purchased from other manufacturers will be paid in cash or financed through third parties 
we believe we would be able to obtain third party financing for excimer lasers  although we do not know the specific terms on which such financing may be available 
market considerations will dictate the actual levels of our equipment purchases 
the mss acquisition requires additional consideration for meeting certain operating income targets 
for the twelve month period ending april   mss met the operating income targets and laservision has recorded additional goodwill and accrued million for contingent consideration to be paid july  additional consideration of up to million is contingent upon operating results for the quarter ending july  up to of the contingent consideration may be paid in laservision common stock valued at the market rate  with the balance to be paid in cash 
the amount of contingent consideration paid in common stock is at the sole discretion of laservision 
laservision intends to pay the million earned in the period ended april  in cash 
until april laservision offered a program for patient financing  the funds for which are provided primarily by a third party lender 
we guarantee these notes payable to the third party lender 
the amount of such financing currently is million 
since march laservision has provided our eye surgeon customers with a patient financing program that required no guarantee of the patients notes payable 
in june laservision acquired southeast medical  inc southeast medical of mandeville  louisiana for million of cash and future contingent consideration which is dependent upon achieving certain levels of revenue 
southeast medical is a provider of mobile cataract services in louisiana and mississippi 
if cash generated from our operations is significantly less than anticipated  we have several strategies to deal with it 
first  we can use the maximum amount of financing available for the purchase of new equipment 
second  we can slow down the purchase of new equipment 
third  we can choose the option of funding of the contingent consideration for the mss acquisition with common stock 
fourth  we can delay any potential acquisitions  or attempt to fund such acquisitions with stock or cash raised from third party sources 
finally  laservision believes it would be able to raise additional money through the borrowing of funds or the sale of debt or additional equity securities 
working capital cash and cash equivalents increased by or million to million at april  from million at april  at april   working capital had increased by or million to million from million at april  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at april  was to one  compared to to one at april short term investments increased million to million at april  from at april  the short term investments have been purchased with cash generated from the underwritten public stock offering completed on may  accounts receivable increased million from april  to april  and million from april  to april  primarily due to increased procedures performed in the us  an increased number of customers being invoiced monthly instead of weekly  and the acquisitions of mss and rsr 
cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  the cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended april  primarily represent the net income in the period plus depreciation and amortization and a net increase in current liabilities  plus decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets less increases in accounts receivable  deferred taxes and inventory 
the cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended april  primarily represent the net income in the period plus depreciation and amortization and a net increase in current liabilities  less increases in accounts receivable  inventory  deferred taxes  and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory are a result of increased procedure volumes 
the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to the accrual for contingent consideration of million for the mss purchase 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal primarily represent the net loss incurred in this period plus depreciation and amortization and an increase in current liabilities  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory  and reflect the continuity of the business cash flows investing activities net cash used for investing activities increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  cash used for investing during the year ended april  was primarily used to acquire short term investments with proceeds of the may secondary stock offering  equipment for the expanding us market  to pay contingent consideration for the acquisition of mss  and to invest in refractive partnerships with eye surgeons and ophthalmic practices 
cash used for investing during the year ended april  was primarily used to acquire equipment for the expanding us market and for the acquisitions of mss and rsr 
net cash used in investing activities increased by or million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  these changes were primarily due to the acquisition of equipment and the acquisition of mss and rsr 
cash flows financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended april  from million for the year ended april  net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended april  was primarily due to the proceeds from the underwritten public stock offering of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  and the return of restricted cash of million partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock of million and by the repayment of certain notes payable and capitalized lease obligations of million 
net cash provided by financing during fiscal was primarily provided by the exercise of stock options and warrants of million  offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable of million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million during fiscal from cash provided of million during fiscal net cash provided by financing for fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from a private offering of preferred stock of million  notes payable of million and exercise of stock options and warrants of million offset by the repayment of notes payable and capitalized lease payments of million 
the series b convertible preferred stock has a beneficial conversion and mandatory redemption features 
under some circumstances  as defined in the preferred stock agreement  the holders of the series b shares may be able to require us to redeem their shares for cash 
these circumstances include the delisting of the common stock by nasdaq  bankruptcy or change of control of laservision  and the decline in the price of the common stock to less than approximately per share 
while there can be no assurance that these circumstances will not arise  laservision believes the likelihood of redemption occurring is remote 
accordingly  the redemption features of the series b shares are not expected to adversely impact our cash flows or liquidity 
at april   this preferred stock was convertible into approximately  shares of common stock 
income taxes at april   laservision had aggregate net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million for income tax purposes available to offset future regular federal taxable income which expire in various amounts through during the year ended april   the company utilized approximately million in nol carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the valuation allowance  provision for income taxes reflects the tax benefit which will be reflected in the statement of operations upon release 
management has determined that based on expected future operating plans  the net deferred tax assets generated by operations at april  will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxes 
therefore  no valuation allowance related to such deferred tax assets has been recorded at april  however  as nols may not all be utilized to offset taxable income in all states where laservision operates  a valuation allowance has been recorded to reflect the potential non realization of state nol carryforwards 
the valuation allowance  equity reflects the tax benefit that will be reflected directly to stockholders equity upon release 
this tax benefit relates to certain equity transactions that did not impact operating results  such as those arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options and warrants 
the deferred tax asset generated by the employees exercise of non qualified options and warrants will serve to reduce future taxes to be paid by laservision 
during the year ended april   the tax benefit generated by the exercise of non qualified options and warrants of approximately million was recorded as an increase in stockholders equity 
as management is uncertain that total tax benefits generated by the exercise of non qualified options and warrants will be utilized to offset future taxes  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded at april  management will continue to review and assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
if laservision s profitability continues  additional reductions in the valuation allowance  equity may be recognized which will be recorded directly to equity and not affect net income 
regardless of when the reduction in the valuation allowance  equity is released  the utilization of the remaining nol s will substantially reduce laservision s cash obligations for the payment of any income taxes otherwise due over the next few years 
risk factors risk factors associated with the successful implementation of our business strategy include i the loss of or changes in key personnel  management or directors  ii our inability to close on market development and partnership agreements in the number and or time frames projected  iii changes in state and or federal governmental regulations which could materially affect our ability to operate  iv any adverse governmental or regulatory changes or actions  including any healthcare regulations and related enforcement actions  v competition from new and existing centers which use lasers to correct vision and or manufacturers  vi changes in commercial prices for our services due to new developments in our markets  vii incorrect assumptions about the number of procedures which doctors will perform on our lasers  viii new methods of vision correction which could make our services less competitive or obsolete  ix litigation claims that may arise  x unanticipated changes in vendor relationships  and xi other factors including those identified in our filings from time to time with the sec 
year year compliance we have experienced no adverse impact related to the onset of the year our services  operations  customers  suppliers and service providers have all continued to operate as usual 
we do not anticipate any future problems with respect to the onset of the year new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas 
statement on financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas provides standards on accounting and disclosure for derivative instruments  and requires that all derivatives be measured at fair value and reported as either assets or liabilities in laservision s consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with issuance of sfas no 
 laservision will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas no later than the beginning of fiscal year based upon preliminary reviews of the provisions of this standard  laservision believes that it will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations or have a material effect on its financial reporting 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin provides specific guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue and related accounting policies in financial statements 
the provisions of sab must be applied by laservision beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal based upon preliminary reviews of the four criteria of revenue recognition specified within sab no 
 we believe that our revenue recognition policies comply with the bulletin 
market risk in the ordinary course of business  laservision is exposed to interest rate risks and foreign currency risks  which we do not currently consider to be material 
these exposures primarily relate to having short term investments earning short term interest rates and to having fixed rate debt 
laservision views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long term commitment  and does not hedge any translation exposures 
marketable equity security prices marketable equity securities at april  which were recorded at a fair value of  have exposure to price risk 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the security s quoted market price  and amounted to  at april
