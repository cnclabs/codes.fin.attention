comparison of year ended december  with year ended december  revenue our revenue was million in and million in this percent increase reflects an increase in concrete and related products revenue  partially offset by decreases in contracting revenue and in other revenue 
our concrete and related products revenue increased percent to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased demand for this division s products on certain caribbean islands  partially offset by decreased demand on other caribbean islands  particularly due to disruptions from hurricanes georges and lenny 
at this time  we cannot predict concrete and related products revenue levels in however  the total volume will be decreased due to the separate sale of our concrete business in st 
thomas and dominica  our business in tortola and our cement terminals

liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the contracting business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our contracting services 
accounts receivable for concrete and related products are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital  and funds available from lines of credit will be adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
after the closing of the large sales transactions in the first quarter of  we paid off a large portion of our debt  approximately million  and our cash and cash equivalents have improved substantially 
see additional information under item subsequent events 
included in working capital is million of equipment and real estate held for sale 
although management intends to sell these assets during  there can be no assurance that they will be sold 
as of december   total outstanding liabilities of million compared to million as of december  as of december   available lines of credit totaled million 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was deposits on sale of assets of million  increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of  and a  reduction in inventories 
the primary use of cash for operating activities was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in purchases of property  plant  and equipment were million 
the purchases were financed to a large extent through equipment financing 
we turned our fiscal year end accounts receivable  excluding notes and employee receivables  approximately times in compared to times in the reduction resulted from large contracting invoicing at the end of the year and an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the concrete division accounts receivable turnover rate did not change 
on november   we extended a million note to the venture in the bahamas  secured by equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  we had trade receivables  net of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  from the venture of approximately  our president has personally guaranteed million of the outstanding trade receivables from the venture

the company entered into a credit agreement with a caribbean bank in november for a total credit of million 
one part of the credit agreement is a term loan for million repayable in monthly installments through november we had million of borrowings outstanding on this loan at december  this balance was paid off in january the second part is a revolving line of credit of million 
the credit line has a review and re approval process in july of each year until we had  outstanding under this line of credit at december  the interest rate on amounts borrowed under both loans varies with the prime rate 
we have a  unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the caribbean 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at percent per annum 
at december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under this line 
we have unsecured notes payable totaling  to a commercial bank in the caribbean 
the note expires in january  and was partially rolled over to new notes expiring in july the notes were paid in february at december  we had borrowed approximately million and million from the company president and a director of our board and his wife  respectively 
the note to the president is unsecured and bears interest at a rate variable with the prime rate 
one million is due on demand and million is due on april  the notes to the director and his wife are secured by equipment and are payable monthly over five years 
we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
we are currently replacing or upgrading some equipment used by the concrete and related products division  principally concrete trucks and quarry equipment 
this should result in a net cash expenditure of approximately million 
at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during  we sold equipment with an original cost basis of approximately million and a net book value of  the net proceeds were approximately  we believe we have available funds or can obtain sufficient financing for our contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   amounts outstanding to these lenders totaled million 
these loans are typically repaid over a three to five year term in monthly principal and interest installments 
a large portion of these loans were paid in full during the first quarter of a significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates 
a substantial increase in interest rates could negatively impact us 
our notes receivable and accrued interest at december  include million in promissory notes from the government of antigua with million classified as a current receivable 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if not addressed  such computer systems  software products and embedded technology may be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause system failures or miscalculations and lead to disruptions in our activities and operations 
during we assessed our computer information systems 
the majority of our systems are purchased from outside vendors 
we experienced very minimal downtime from the systems at the beginning of year and all software is today fully functional 
we took an inventory of all computers and software and we made the changes needed for these systems to become year compliant 
we implemented a new information system for our financial reporting  and we are installing new distribution systems for the island subsidiaries 
we contacted suppliers and customers regarding their year compliance status 
we have not been affected by any of the suppliers or customers year problems 
we estimated to spend around  on our year project 
this consisted of pcs  software and other related costs 
most of these monies have been spent

the agreement has stipulations so that we will be able to enjoy the best price available in the local market from any cement supplier
