the company s commissary system is a significant competitive advantage for the company 
while requiring a major commitment of capital  the commissaries assure both consistent quality and supply of fresh dough products to both company owned and franchised bakery cafes 
in order to develop a specific market with our concept  a commissary must be available to service the market 
a commissary may begin operations by serving one bakery cafe  however  as our target markets are developed and built out over time  the commissary becomes more efficient 
in addition  the commissary system allows the company to control product quality for both company owned and franchised bakery cafes thereby increasing product consistency and enhancing brand identity 
it is the intention of the company to focus its immediate growth in areas that allow it to continue to gain efficiencies within its current commissary structure by focusing in areas that geographically complement markets already served by an existing commissary unit 
the company s revenues are derived from restaurant sales  commissary sales to franchisees and franchise and other revenues 
commissary sales to franchisees are the sales of commissary fresh dough products to our franchisees

the primary reason for the decline was that the au bon pain units historically ran at a higher food cost percentage than the panera bread units 
with the sale of the au bon pain division in may   the full year results were more heavily weighted to the panera bread units 
the costs associated with the sale of fresh dough products to franchises are included in commissary cost of sales  and include the cost of sales  salaries  benefits  and other operating expenses  excluding depreciation associated with the sale of fresh dough products to our franchisees 
in  commissary cost of sales as a percentage of commissary sales to franchisees declined to from in the decline is due to the commissaries becoming more efficient as they service more bakery cafes 
only one new commissary was opened in while panera bread added new bakery cafes on a system wide basis 
the cost of labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased to in from in the overall increase in labor for the year is primarily due to an increase in the average hourly wage rate driven by low unemployment and a highly competitive labor market 
the cost of occupancy as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased to in from in the decrease is due primarily to increased sales volumes at company operated bakery cafes and the sale of the au bon pain division  which had historically run higher occupancy costs due to their locations in the downtown areas of larger cities 
other restaurant operating expenses increased as a percentage of restaurant revenues to in from in the increase is primarily due to increases in the fixed costs associated with the opening of new bakery cafes in and a small increase in advertising at the panera bread bakery cafes during the year

operating income in was favorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the suspension of depreciation and amortization of the au bon pain division assets held for sale as of august   the date of the agreement to sell that business 
before the non recurring charges and suspension of depreciation and amortization  operating income increased by in to million in from million in interest expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in this reduction is due primarily to the repayment of the company s outstanding debt with the proceeds of the sale of the au bon pain division

the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the potential for the non deductibility of capital losses related to the taxable loss on the sale of the au bon pain division and the expectation that certain deferred state tax assets will be unrealizable following the sale 
the company reevaluates the positive and negative evidence impacting the realization of its deferred tax assets on an annual basis

year issue the year issue relates to how dates are stored and used in computer systems  applications  and embedded systems 
as the century date change occurred  certain date sensitive systems had to recognize the year as  not as this inability to recognize and properly treat the year as could have caused these systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
in prior years  we discussed our plans and progress to be year ready 
we completed the installation  implementation  and testing of our systems in late  and made modifications as deemed necessary 
as a result of our planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in business critical information technology and non information technology systems  and the company believes these systems responded successfully to the year date change 
in addressing the year issue  the company incurred internal labor costs as well as consulting and other expenses 
as of december   the company expended approximately  in external costs consulting fees and related costs 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues regarding our internal systems  the products and services of third parties  or the businesses operated by our franchisees 
the company will continue to monitor date sensitive systems as certain key dates occur throughout the year to ensure that any year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
impact of inflation in the past  the company has been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases through increased menu prices 
there have been and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit the company s ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on the company s net income have not been materially adverse 
a majority of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although the company has and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  the company has not experienced to date a significant reduction in gross profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins 
forward looking statements matters discussed in this report which relate to events or developments that are expected to occur in the future  including any discussion of growth or anticipated operating results are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of and section e of the securities exchange act of identified by the words estimate  project  anticipates  expects  intends  believes  future  and similar expressions 
these are statements which express management s belief  expectations or intentions regarding the company s future performance 
moreover  a number of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements due to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
the company s operating results may be negatively affected by many factors  included but not limited to the lack of availability of sufficient capital to it and the developers party to franchise development agreements with the company  variations in the number and timing of bakery cafe openings  public acceptance of new bakery cafes  consumer preferences  competition  commodity costs  and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
recent accounting pronouncements none which will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  the company s unsecured revolving line of credit bears an interest rate using the commercial bank s prime rate or libor as the basis  and therefore is subject to additional expense should there be an increase in prime or libor interest rates 
panera bread has no foreign operations and accordingly  no foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk 
the au bon pain division did have foreign operations  however  these were sold with the au bon pain division on may
