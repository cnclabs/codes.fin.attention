total assets at december   and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
this growth was a result of a strong local economy  the addition of new loan officers  aggressive marketing  and the company s overall growth strategy 
loans were billion at december   an increase of million or from billion at the end of  marking the second consecutive year that loan growth exceeded million 
loans were billion at year end deposits increased to billion at year end from billion at year end and billion at year end net income available for common shareholders was million  million  and million and diluted earnings per common share was   and for the years ended  and  respectively 
this increase in net income was primarily the result of strong loan growth  maintaining strong asset quality and expense control and resulted in returns on average assets roa of   and and returns on average common equity roe of   and for the years ended  and  respectively 
results for include the impact of the special charge taken in the second quarter 
on an operating basis  excluding this special charge  the company s net income was million or per diluted common share  resulting in an roa of  roe of  and an efficiency ratio of 
results of operations net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income is the principal source of the company s earnings 
in  net interest income provided of the company s net revenues  compared with in and in interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
versus net interest margin increased six basis points in to 
the principal factor contributing to the increase was lower cost of funds partially offset by lower yielding earning assets resulting in higher interest rate spreads 
total net interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
growth in average earning assets was million or while yields decreased seven basis points to 
during the first six months of the year yields remained relatively flat and then increased during the final six months of the year as the bank s prime lending rate increased 
the yield on earning assets during the fourth quarter was the highest for the year  resulting in increased yields on a weighted average basis 
net interest margin risk is typically related to a narrowing of the prime rate and cost of funds 
the company reduced this risk with a modestly asset sensitive balance sheet during on june  the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate and discount rate by basis points 
this was followed by two additional basis point increases on august  and november  due to the bank s asset sensitivity the net interest margin gradually increased during the second half of the year 
this resulted in net interest margins of and and net interest spreads of and for and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income was due primarily to a million or increase in average earning assets 
average loans grew million or during while average securities grew million or during the same period 
the yield earned on average loans outstanding decreased basis points to in overall  the yield earned on average earning assets decreased seven basis points to in compared to a basis point decrease in the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities

the increase in net interest income was due primarily to a million or increase in average interest earning assets 
average loans grew million or during while average securities grew million or during the same period 
the increase in net interest income caused by this increase in average interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase in average interest earning liabilities of million or

the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made and all average balances are daily average balances 
nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield

this increase approximates a reserve of provided for new loans recorded 
although no assurance can be given  management believes that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate considering loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
management constantly reviews the company s loan loss allowance policy as its loan portfolio grows and diversifies

noninterest income noninterest income grew to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from noninterest income totaled million in  an increase of million or from year ended december  dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts    investment services    factoring fee income   loan fee income    bank owned life insurance income  letters of credit fee income gain loss on sale of securities  net other income    the largest component of noninterest income is service charges  which were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and for these were increases of and  respectively for and several factors are attributable for this growth 
first  during this three year period the company introduced several new products to their existing retail product line 
secondly  in august  the company initiated a deposit campaign encompassing all of their existing market areas and redesigned the consumer banking area which has experienced strong growth since its inception 
additionally  the number of deposit accounts grew from  at december  to  at december  and to  at december  additional areas of increased growth included investment services and factoring fee income 
factoring fee income is derived from the acquisition of first republic capital corp 
and city financial services  inc in february of this acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and due to immateriallity  prior years financial statements were not restated 
investment services income grew to million  or from the period 
during the past several years  the international department and the foreign exchange division have experienced strong growth  including the addition of seven new officers 
this addition adds to the high quality of personal service and responsiveness to customer needs 
secondly the company introduced new services such as confirmation of letters of credit for a variety of countries and banks 
the international department also has a registered broker for non us citizens which allows the company to offer investment products in that market as well 
noninterest expenses for the year ended december   noninterest expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million during  which had increased from million during the increase in noninterest expenses during these periods was due primarily to salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses  fdic insurance and merger related expenses 
the efficiency ratio was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in efficiency ratio during resulted primarily from expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of fort bend holding corp 
excluding the special charge incurred  the efficiency ratio would have improved to 
additionally  less than of the estimated cost savings projected from the merger were realized during full cost savings are expected to be achieved in salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended december  increased million or from the same period in this increase was due primarily to hiring of additional personnel required to accommodate the company s growth 
total full time equivalent employees for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
occupancy expense rose million from the prior year in both and major categories included within occupancy expense are building lease expense  depreciation expense  and maintenance contract expense 
building lease expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of  or 
the company continues to increase the rentable square feet of the galleria location to accommodate the increases in personnel 
depreciation expense increased  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to depreciation on equipment provided to new employees and expense related to technology upgrades throughout the company 
maintenance contract expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or compared to million in and  in the company has purchased maintenance contracts for major operating systems throughout the organization 
fdic insurance expense increased  to  during this increase was the result of a three basis point increase in rates as a result of the bank s capital classification changing from well capitalized to adequately capitalized and due to a million increase in deposits from which the fdic assessment is calculated 
during the second quarter of  the company expensed approximately million pretax in merger related expenses and other charges including investment banking fees  other professional fees and severance expense associated with the merger of fort bend holding corp 
income taxes income tax expense includes the regular federal income tax at the statutory rate  plus the income tax component of the texas franchise tax 
the amount of federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income  the amount of nondeductible interest expense  and the amount of other nondeductible expenses 
taxable income for the income tax component of the texas franchise tax is the federal pre tax income  plus certain officers salaries  less interest income from federal securities 
in income tax expense was million  an increase of million or from the million of income tax expense in in income tax expense was million  an increase of million or from the million of income tax expense in impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company tries to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
see financial condition interest rate sensitivity and liquidity below 
financial condition loans held for investment loans were billion at december   an increase of million  or from december  loans were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from billion at december  during the past years loans have grown at an annualized rate of 
this growth is consistent with the bank s strategy of targeting corporate middle market and private banking customers and providing innovative products with superior customer service 
this plan also includes establishing new branches in areas that demographically complement existing or targeted customer base  pursuing selected mergers acquisitions which will add new markets  delivery systems and talent to the bank and leveraging new or existing technology to improve the profitability of the bank and its customers 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio of the company by major category as of the dates indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate construction land development     family residential     commercial owner occupied     farmland     other     consumer     loans held for investment     amount percent commercial and industrial  real estate construction land development  family residential  commercial owner occupied  farmland  other  consumer  loans held for investment  the primary lending focus of the company is on small and medium sized commercial  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans  lines of credit and equipment financing 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both collateralized and uncollateralized  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
generally  the company s commercial loans are underwritten in the company s primary market area on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from cash flow 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment or other assets 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
a substantial portion of the company s real estate loans consists of loans collateralized by real estate and other assets of commercial customers 
additionally  a portion of the company s lending activity consists of the origination of single family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner occupied properties located in the company s primary market area 
the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products which generally are amortized over five to years 
loans collateralized by single family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value 
the company requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
although the contractual loan payment periods for single family residential real estate loans are generally for a three to five year period  such loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms 
the bank is engaged in the mortgage banking business and originates and purchases residential and commercial mortgage loans to sell to investors with servicing rights retained 
the bank also provides residential and commercial construction financing to builders and developers and acts as a broker in the origination of multi family and commercial real estate loans 
consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and real estate construction loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with fixed interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized in the following table december  after one after one year through five or less five years years total commercial and industrial     real estate construction     total     loans with a fixed interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     loans held for sale loans held for sale of million at december  increased from million at december  these loans are typically sold to investors within one month of origination 
the increase during is due to a reclassification from the loan portfolio 
it is expected that these loans will ultimately be sold after restrictions have expired relating to pooling of interests merger 
loan review and allowance for loan losses the company s loan review procedures include a credit quality assurance process that begins with approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  an independent loan review department staffed with occ experienced personnel  low individual lending limits for officers  senior loan committee approval for large credit relationships and quality loan documentation procedures 
the company also maintains a well developed monitoring process for credit extensions in excess of  the company performs monthly and quarterly concentration analyses based on various factors such as industries  collateral types  business lines  large credit sizes  international investments and officer portfolio loads 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers 
the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions 
historically  the houston metropolitan area has been affected by the state of the energy business  but since the mid s the economic impact has been reduced by a combination of increased industry diversification and less reliance on debt to finance expansion 
when energy prices drop  as they did in  it is the company s practice to review and adjust underwriting standards with respect to companies affected by oil and gas price volatility  and to continuously monitor existing credit exposure to companies which are impacted by this price volatility 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluation  management considers growth in the loan portfolio  the diversification by industry of the company s commercial loan portfolio  the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the results of recent regulatory examinations  the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers  the amount of charge offs for the period  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security and the evaluation of its loan portfolio by the loan review function 
charge offs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers the risk classification or delinquency status of loans and other factors  such as collateral value  portfolio composition  trends in economic conditions and the financial strength of borrowers 
management establishes specific allowances for loans which management believes require reserves greater than those allocated according to their classification or delinquent status 
the allocated component of the allowance is supplemented by an unallocated component 
the unallocated portion of the allowance includes management s judgmental determination of the amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and concentration risks 
the company then charges to operations a provision for loan losses determined on an annualized basis to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level determined according to the foregoing methodology 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of such date 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses  beginning balance      provision charged against operations      charge offs     recoveries increase from acquisition adjustment to conform reporting periods allowance for loan losses  ending balance      allowance to period end loans net charge offs to average loans allowance to period end nonperforming loans the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information for the dates indicated 
portions of the allowance for loan losses are allocated to cover the estimated losses inherent in particular risk categories of loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is based upon the company s loss experience over a period of years and is adjusted for subjective factors such as economic trends  performance trends  portfolio age and concentrations of credit 
prior year allocations have been restated to conform to this methodology 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future loan losses may occur

all loans past due days  however  are placed on nonaccrual status  unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection 
cash payments received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual are recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to collection 
the company is sometimes required to revise a loan s interest rate or repayment terms in a troubled debt restructuring 
nonperforming assets were million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  this resulted in a ratio of nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate of   and for the years ended   and  respectively

in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible writedowns or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the company s impaired loans were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the largest component of impaired loans at december  and is a commercial energy related loan of approximately million and million  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during and was million and million  respectively 
the total required allowance for loan losses related to these loans was for each reported period 
interest income on impaired loans of million and  was recognized for cash payments received in and  respectively 
the bank is not committed to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans have been modified 
securities at the date of purchase  the company classifies debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost  increased by accretion of discounts and reduced by amortization of premiums  both computed by the interest method 
management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized 
gains and losses on sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
the company has classified all securities as available for sale at december  this allows the company to manage its investment portfolio more effectively and to enhance the average yield on the portfolio 
the amortized cost of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity is as follows december  dollars in thousands available for sale us government us      mortgage backed securities      federal reserve bank stock    federal home loan bank stock      other securities      total securities available for sale      held to maturity us government us     mortgage backed securities     total securities held to maturity     the following table presents the amortized cost of securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale and their approximate fair values as of the dates shown december  december  gross gross gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair amortized unrealized unrealized cost gain loss value cost gain loss dollars in thousands available for sale us government us      mortgage backed securities      federal reserve bank stock    federal home loan bank stock    other securities    total securities available for sale      held to maturity us government us  mortgage backed securities  total securities held to maturity  december  gross gross fair amortized unrealized unrealized fair value cost gain loss value available for sale us government us    mortgage backed securities     federal reserve bank stock    federal home loan bank stock    other securities    total securities available for sale     held to maturity us government us    mortgage backed securities    total securities held to maturity    in connection with the fort bend merger  the company transferred all of fort bend s held to maturity debt securities to the available for sale category 
the amortized cost of these securities at the time of transfer was million and the unrealized gain was   net of income taxes 
the company does not intend to sell these securities in the near term 
securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  during  securities increased million from million at december  the yield on the securities portfolio for was while the yield was in the company has no mortgage backed securities that have been issued by non agency entities 
included in the company s mortgage backed securities at december  were agency issued collateral mortgage obligations with a book value of million and a fair market value of million 
at december   million of the mortgage backed securities held by the company had final maturities of more than years 
at december   approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities earned interest at floating rates and repriced within one year  and accordingly  were less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investments and their weighted average yields at december  the yield on the securities portfolio is based on average historical cost balances and does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a separate component of other comprehensive income

cash value of bank owned life insurance policies was approximately million at december  compared with a balance of million at december  this increase primarily resulted from insurance purchased for new officers  including those from the merger with fort bend 
factored receivables result from providing operating funds to businesses by converting their accounts receivable to cash 
during factored receivables increased million to million 
this increase was due to several factors including new officers hired and aggressive marketing  both internally and externally 
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and their financial reporting amounts give rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
at december  deferred tax assets totaled million compared with million for the same period in this increase was caused by a decline in the market value of the securities portfolio and an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposits consist of demand  savings  now accounts  money market and time accounts 
the company relies primarily on customer service  advertising  and competitive pricing policies to attract and retain these deposits 
as of december   the company had less than two percent of its deposits classified as brokered funds and does not anticipate any significant increase 
deposits provide the majority of the funding for the company s lending and investment activities  and the interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
the company s ratio of average demand deposits to average total deposits for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
average total deposits during increased to billion from billion in  an increase of million or 
average noninterest bearing deposits increased to million in from million in due to the increase of approximately  deposit accounts

interest rate sensitivity and liquidity asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company adjusts its interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities and may use interest rate products such as interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the company did not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk during the years ended december  and the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior officers of the bank and three outside directors  in accordance with policies approved by the bank s board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to the bank s overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews the bank s liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  retail and institutional deposit activity  current market conditions  and interest rates on both a local and national level 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends  and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
the interest rate scenarios presented in the table include interest rates at december  and and as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the twelve month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
changes in interest rates impact on net interest income december  december  impact on market value of portfolio equity december  december  the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
while the gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company s one year cumulative gap position at december  was negative million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis the company uses a simulation model to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
based on the company s december  simulation analysis  the company estimates that it s one year cumulative gap position  adjusted for the calculated correlation between changes in the prime rate and interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is a positive 
this results primarily from the behavior of demand  money market and savings deposits 
the company has found that historically  interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in prime rate

for the year ended december   the company s liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits  and increases in short term borrowings  primarily from the federal home loan bank 
the cash and federal funds sold position  supplemented by amortizing securities and loan portfolios  have generally created an adequate liquidity position 
subject to certain limitations  the bank may borrow funds from the federal home loan bank fhlb in the form of advances 
credit availability from the fhlb to the bank is based on the bank s financial and operating condition 
borrowings from the fhlb to the bank was approximately million at december  in addition to creditworthiness  the bank must own a minimum amount of fhlb capital stock 
this minimum is of outstanding fhlb advances 
unused borrowing capacity at december  was approximately million 
the bank uses fhlb advances for both long term and short term liquidity needs 
other than normal banking operations  the bank has no long term liquidity needs 
the bank has never been involved with highly leveraged transactions that may cause unusual potential long term liquidity needs 
capital resources shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of million  or 
capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the occ 
both the federal reserve board and the occ have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
bank regulatory authorities in the united states have issued risk based capital standards by which all bank holding companies and banks are evaluated in terms of capital adequacy 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve board apply to the company  and the occ guidelines apply to the bank 
these guidelines relate a financial institution s capital to the risk profile of its assets 
the risk based capital standards require all financial organizations to have tier capital of at least of risk adjusted assets and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of risk adjusted assets 
tier capital includes  generally  common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the agencies have also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets

also pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
under the federal reserve board s regulations  the bank is classified as adequately capitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action
