special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see forward looking information may prove inaccurate on page for additional factors relating to such statements 
overview teletech generates its revenues primarily by providing customer management solutions  both from teletech leased customer interaction centers fully outsourced and client owned customer interaction centers facilities management 
the company s fully outsourced customer interaction centers are utilized to serve either multiple clients shared centers or one dedicated client dedicated centers 
the company currently has dedicated centers only in the united states 
the company bills for its services based primarily on the amount of time teletech representatives devote to a client s program  and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the company also derives revenues from consulting services  including the sale of customer interaction center and customer management technology  automated customer support  database management  systems integration  web based applications and distance based learning and education 
these consulting and technology revenues historically have not been a significant component of the company s revenues 
the company seeks to enter into multiyear contracts with its clients that cannot be terminated for convenience except upon the payment of a contractually agreed amount 
the majority of the company s revenues are  and the company anticipates that the majority of its future revenues will continue to be  from multiyear contracts 
however  the company does provide some programs on a short term basis 
teletech s profitability is significantly influenced by its customer interaction center capacity utilization 
the company seeks to optimize new and existing capacity utilization during both peak weekday and off peak night and weekend periods to achieve maximum fixed cost absorption 
historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been generated during peak periods 
teletech may be adversely impacted by excess capacity in its fully outsourced centers if prior to the opening or expansion of a customer interaction center  the company has not contracted for the provision of services or if a client program does not reach its intended level of operations on a timely basis 
in addition  the company can also be adversely impacted by excess capacity in its facilities management contracts 
in a facilities management contract  the company does not incur the costs of the facilities and equipment  however  the costs of the management team supporting the customer interaction center are semifixed in nature  and absorption of these costs will be negatively impacted if the customer interaction center has idle capacity 
the company attempts to plan the development and opening of new customer interaction centers to minimize the financial impact resulting from excess capacity 
in planning the opening of new centers or the expansion of existing centers  management considers numerous factors that affect its capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations or expansions of existing programs  and the size and timing of new client contracts that the company expects to obtain 
the company continues to concentrate its marketing efforts toward obtaining larger  more complex  strategic customer management programs 
as a result  the time required to negotiate and execute an agreement with the client can be significant 
to enable the company to respond rapidly to changing market demands  implement new programs and expand existing programs  teletech may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in excess capacity 
teletech targets capacity utilization in its fully outsourced centers at of its available workstations during the weekday period 
the company was adversely impacted by excess capacity in its fully outsourced centers during late  and that has resulted in a decline in operating margins from those achieved during during and  the company experienced excess capacity in newly constructed shared centers in moundsville  west virginia  uniontown  pennsylvania  and mexico city  which were completed prior to the contracting of minimum targeted revenue 
capacity utilization was also adversely affected in the second half of and throughout when one of the company s telecommunications clients significantly reduced the number of customer interactions managed by the company for this client 
the company also has incurred reduced operating margins in and on one of its significant facilities management contracts due to reduced volumes and excess capacity in certain centers operated by the company 
however  this trend has reversed  and based on capacity and existing client commitments as of december   the company believes its existing capacity may not be sufficient 
as a result  in  the company plans to deploy five or six new shared centers 
the company records costs specifically associated with client programs as costs of services 
these costs  which include direct labor wages and benefits  telecommunication charges and certain facility costs  are primarily variable in nature 
labor costs represent in excess of of costs of services 
all other expenses of operations  including technology support  depreciation and amortization  sales and marketing  human resource management and other administrative functions and customer interaction center operational expenses that are not allocable to specific programs  are recorded as selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses tend to be either semivariable or fixed in nature 
the majority of the company s operating expenses have consisted of labor costs 
representative wage rates  which comprise the majority of the company s labor costs  have been and are expected to continue to be a key component of the company s expenses 
a significant portion of the company s contracts with its clients contain clauses allowing adjustment of billing rates in accordance with wage inflation 
the cost characteristics of teletech s fully outsourced programs differ significantly from the cost characteristics of its facilities management programs 
under facilities management programs  customer interaction centers and the related equipment are owned by the client but are staffed and managed by teletech 
accordingly  facilities management programs have higher costs of services as a percentage of revenues and lower sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues than fully outsourced programs 
as a result  the company expects its overall gross margin will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis as revenues attributable to fully outsourced programs vary in proportion to revenues attributable to facilities management programs 
management believes the company s operating margin  which is income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues  is a better measure of profitability on a period to period basis than gross margin 
operating margin may be less subject to fluctuation as the proportion of the company s business portfolio attributable to fully outsourced programs versus facilities management programs changes 
revenue from facilities management contracts represented  and of consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
based on sales pipeline data as of december   the company expects its facilities management programs to continue to decline as a percentage of overall revenues 
the company has used business combinations and acquisitions to expand the company s international customer management operations and to obtain complementary technology solution offerings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest on the company s line of credit and its canadian subsidiary s operating loan is variable based on the bank s base rate or offshore rate  and therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there were approximately  in borrowings outstanding on the operating loan 
the company monitors interest rates frequently and has sufficient cash balances as of december   to pay off the line of credit and any early termination penalties should interest rates increase significantly 
the company s investments are typically short term in nature and as a result do not expose the company to significant risk from interest rate fluctuations 
therefore  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  mexico  new zealand  singapore and the united kingdom 
revenues and expenses from these operations are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s revenues and net income attributed to these subsidiaries 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations was immaterial for the years presented 
however  the company intends to expand overseas thereby increasing foreign currency risk in future years
