as of december  approximately million of floor plan borrowing was outstanding 
interest rates on the floor plan agreements are variable and increase or decrease based on movements in prime or libor borrowing rates 
on october   the company entered into a new credit agreement  dated as of august   as amended the credit agreement  which provides for up to million in revolving loans to be used for acquisitions  working capital  the repurchase of notes  the repurchase of common stock  letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at libor plus  other then borrowings to repurchase the notes which bear interest at libor plus 
the credit agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the company s auto dealership subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  repay other indebtedness  repurchase capital stock  pay dividends  create liens on assets  make investments or acquisitions and engage in mergers or consolidations 
in addition  the company is required to comply with specified ratios and tests  including debt to equity  debt service coverage and minimum working capital covenants 
the credit agreement also contains typical events of default including change of control  material adverse change and non payment of obligations 
in addition  substantially all of the assets of the company s dealerships not subject to security interests granted to floor plan lending sources are subject to security interests granted to lenders under the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants at december  during the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the indentures governing the notes require the company to comply with specified debt service coverage ratio levels in order to incur incremental debt 
the indentures governing the notes also limit the company s ability to pay dividends based on a formula which take into account  among other things  the company s consolidated net income 
the indentures also contain other covenants which restrict the company s ability to purchase capital stock  incur liens  sell assets and enter into other transactions 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the company s auto dealership subsidiaries 
during the company repurchased and retired million of the notes 
as of march   there was million principal amount of notes outstanding 
the indentures governing the notes contain a provision which requires the company to offer to purchase all of the then outstanding notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of their principal amount in the event of a change in control 
a change in control will be deemed to have occurred if a purchaser  as defined  beneficially obtains of the voting power  as defined  of the voting stock of the company 
in december  the company announced its plan to repurchase up to of the total outstanding common stock of the company 
the shares of common stock may be acquired from time to time over a two year period either through open market purchases  negotiated transactions  or other means based upon market conditions 
the repurchase of shares of common stock by the company has increased the beneficial ownership interest of the purchaser above of the total ownership of the company

the company has sufficient availability under the credit agreement to finance the repurchase of the notes 
during  cash flow from operations amounted to million 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  totaled million  relating to dealership acquisitions and capital 
table of contents expenditures

consequently  the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute earnings to the company and to make other advances and payments by such subsidiaries to the company 
the company s principal source of growth has come from acquisitions of automobile dealerships 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its current operations and commitments 
to the extent the company pursues additional significant acquisitions  it may need to raise additional capital either through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities or through additional bank borrowings 
a public equity offering would require the prior approval of certain automobile manufacturers 
cyclicality unit sales of motor vehicles  particularly new vehicles  historically have been cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the automotive retailing industry tends to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
the company believes that the industry is influenced by general economic conditions and particularly by consumer confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  interest rates and credit availability 
seasonality the company s combined business is modestly seasonal overall 
the greatest seasonalities exist with the dealerships in the northeast united states  for which the second and third quarters are the strongest with respect to vehicle related sales 
the service and parts business at all dealerships experience relatively modest seasonal fluctuations 
effects of inflation the company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the last few years have not had a significant impact on revenue or profitability 
the company does not expect inflation to have any near term material effects on the sale of its products and services 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be no such effect in the future 
the company finances substantially all of its inventory through various revolving floor plan arrangements with interest rates that vary based on the prime rate or libor 
such rates have historically increased during periods of increasing inflation 
the company does not believe that it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage should interest rates increase due to increased inflation since most other automobile dealers have similar floating rate borrowing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of the company s business is conducted in the united states where its revenues and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
as a result  the majority of the company s results of operations are not subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the limited financial exposure it faces with respect to such risk 
in common with other automobile retailers  the company purchases certain of its new car inventories from foreign manufacturers 
the company s business in this regard is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
the company s future results could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in the interest rates on a significant portion of its outstanding indebtedness 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over libor 
based on the amount outstanding as of march   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to the company s annual interest expense 
similarly  amounts outstanding under floor plan financing arrangements bear interest at a variable rate based on a margin over libor 
based on the average aggregate outstanding amounts under floor plan financing arrangements during the year ended december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to the company s annual floor plan interest expense 
during january  the company entered into swap agreements pursuant to which a notional million of the company s floating rate debt has been exchanged for fixed rate debt 
the fixed rate interest to be paid by the company is based on libor  as adjusted  and amounts to approximately 
for fixed rate debt including the notes  certain seller financed promissory notes and obligations under certain capital leases  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact the company s earnings or cash flows
