results of operations the company s net income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately  or 
the decrease in net income for compared to is primarily attributable to special charges of approximately million after taxes that were recorded in relating to merger integration and merger related expenses  and nonrecurring gains recorded in from the sale of fnbuc and two branches of gfb and fsb which aggregated approximately million after taxes 
the company s diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  was  a decrease of per share or from diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   of 
the company s emphasis on maintaining its net interest margin resulted in an increase in net interest income of  additionally  noninterest income decreased  and the provision for loan losses decreased  an increase in noninterest expense of  partially offset the increase in net interest income and decrease in provision for loan losses

the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to the volume component 
interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments reduced by the non deductible portion of interest expense using a federal income tax rate of in   and allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses appropriate for the quality of the loan portfolio and sufficient to meet anticipated future loan losses 
the company utilizes a comprehensive loan review and risk identification process and the analysis of affiliate banks financial trends to determine the adequacy of the allowance 
many factors are considered when evaluating the allowance 
the company s quarterly analysis is based on historical loss trends  migration trends in criticized and classified loans in the portfolio  trends in past due and non accrual loans  trends in portfolio volume  composition  maturity  and concentrations  changes in local and regional economic market conditions  the accuracy of the loan review and risk identification system  and the experience  ability  and depth of lending personnel and management 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for each affiliate bank  the company relies primarily on analysis of the major components of the loan portfolio such as commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  consumer loans  construction loans  residential real estate loans  and all other loans and unfunded commitments 
the company has established a minimum loss factor for certain problem loan grade categories and for general categories of all other loans 
all significant problem loans are reviewed individually to establish either the minimum loss factor formula or a specific reserve higher than the formula 
all significant non problem loans are reserved at the greater of the minimum loss rate for the category of loans or the weighted average historical loss rate over a defined loss horizon as computed from the migration analysis 
other homogenous loan pools such as the consumer loans  construction loans  and residential mortgage loans are reserved at the greater of the minimum loss rate or the weighted average historical loss rate as computed in the migration analysis 
management evaluates the allowance on a quarterly basis 
the provision for loan losses for each bank is adjusted to the appropriate level based on the analysis methodology described above 
a substantial portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate in markets in northern  middle and coastal georgia  southeastern tennessee  southwestern north carolina  and eastern alabama 
the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the company s loan portfolio is dependent on or susceptible to changes in economic conditions in these markets 
the allowance for loan losses approximated of outstanding loans at december   and at december  the allowance increased from  at december   to  at december  net loans charged off in were  or approximately

     ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding  net of unearned income allowance for loan losses to loans  net of unearned income total recoveries increased by  in from this was primarily due to management s decision to form a special assets division that was given the responsibility of recovering loans that were previously charged off 
this additional emphasis on the recovery of loans decreased net loans charged off from  in to  in nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets  and underperforming loans nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans 
the company has not restructured any loans of significance through december  underperforming loans consist of loans that are past due with respect to principal or interest more than days and still accruing interest 
nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans  underperforming loans  real estate acquired through foreclosure  securities that are in default  and other repossessed assets 
accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal or it becomes contractually in default for days or more as to either interest or principal unless it is both well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  previously accrued and uncollected interest for the year in which the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged to interest income unless management believes the accrued interest is recoverable through the liquidation of collateral 
management is not aware of any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed below which i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
nonperforming loans were  at december   compared to  at december  nonperforming loans represented of total loans at december   as compared to of total loans at december  nonperforming assets decreased to  at december   as compared to  at december   primarily due to decreases in other real estate at several of the banks and at the parent company 
nonperforming assets represented of total loans  real estate acquired through foreclosure  and other nonperforming assets at december   as compared to at december  underperforming loans  consisting of loan past due days or more which are still accruing interest  are much more volatile and tend to fluctuate more frequently based upon the timing of payment collection  transfer to nonperforming status  or transfer to current status

   reduction of interest income the company has allocated the allowance for loan losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below 
this allocation is based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions  past loan loss experience  the adequacy and nature of the collateral  and such factors  which  in the judgment of management  deserve recognition in estimating loan losses 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowances for losses on loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure and other nonperforming assets 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
because the allocation is based on estimates and subjective judgment  it is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which loan charge offs may occur 
in  the level of real estate allowance increased while the consumer installment level decreased due to fluctuations in the allocation and changes in the mix of loans within the portfolio

also  special charges of approximately  were taken in the fourth quarter of associated with the consolidation of the company s two headquarters into one location and costs associated with building a single identity for its thirteen affiliates 
the nonrecurring charge included costs to i move the company s dahlonega and macon  georgia headquarters to alpharetta  georgia  ii reduce employment at the two headquarters and pay related severance benefits  iii rename the company s banks and market the uniform century south bank brand name  iv revise and update operating policies and procedures  and v write off redundant and outdated equipment

noninterest expense increased  or in salaries and benefits expenses increased  or in  representing growth in the number of employees 
occupancy related expenses decreased by  income taxes the company provided income tax expense of   and  or approximately   and of its income before income taxes in   and  respectively 
the company expects its effective income tax rate to increase slightly in as a result of expected decreased tax exempt income as a percentage of total income due to the unavailability of high yielding bank qualified tax exempt investments and also to overall growth in the loan portfolio 
in  three of the subsidiary banks formed captive real estate investment trusts reits for various business purposes 
because of the taxation requirements of reits  the company has experienced a positive impact on its overall effective income tax rate 
loan portfolio during  average loans outstanding net of unearned income  increased from million to million and comprised of average interest earning assets and of average total assets 
during  average loans outstanding net of unearned income  increased from million to million and comprised of average interest earning assets and of average total assets 
the relative level of average loans  when compared to the level of average deposits  increased in as a result of management s emphasis on maximizing the company s level of investments in loans to interest earning assets to improve the overall yield on interest earning assets 
this is evident in the ratio of average loans to average deposits  which was   and in   and  respectively

additionally  the refinancing of such loans or the potential delinquency of such loans could also cause differences between the contractual maturities reflected above and the actual repayment of such loans 
investment securities the company s investment securities portfolio serves several essential functions  such as providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required for certain deposits 
as a result  the company has segmented its investment securities portfolio to identify those securities that could possibly be used in future asset liability restructuring securities available for sale

 over twelve months  total  the company has analyzed the composition of its certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts of  or more and believes that less than of such deposits should be deemed volatile and thereby affect the company s liquidity 
the volatile deposits are with governmental bodies in the states or in the local communities in the markets that the company and the banks serve 
the remainder of these certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts are with individuals who reside in the local areas and with whom the banks have had consistent deposit relations for long periods of time 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  either depositors withdrawing funds or borrowers needing loans  and the ability of the company to meet those requirements 
management monitors and maintains appropriate levels of assets and liabilities so that maturities of assets are such that adequate funds are provided to meet estimated customer withdrawals and loan requests 
the company s liquidity position depends primarily upon the liquidity of its assets relative to its need to respond to short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts and loan funding commitments 
primary sources of liquidity are scheduled payments on the company s loans and interest on and maturities of its investments 
occasionally  the company will sell investment securities available for sale in connection with the management of its income tax position and its interest sensitivity gap 
proceeds from such sales amounted to approximately  during and represent another source of liquidity to the company 
principal payments on loans also provide the company with another source of liquidity 
the company may also utilize its cash and due from banks  interest earning deposits in other banks  and federal funds sold to meet liquidity requirements as needed 
at december   the company s cash and due from banks were  its interest earning deposits in other banks were  its federal funds sold were  and its investment securities designated as available for sale were  all of the above could be converted to cash on relatively short notice 
the company also has the ability  on a short term basis  to purchase federal funds from other financial institutions 
presently  the company has made arrangements with commercial banks for short term unsecured advances up to approximately  in addition to  which is available to the company  subject to available collateral  in the form of additional federal home loan bank advances 
the company has authorized the acquisition of treasury shares up to amounts necessary to effect the purchase business combination of haywood bancshares  inc haywood 
prior to the february  closing of this purchase business combination  the company had purchased as of december    of its common shares specifically for the acquisition of haywood 
the company issued  shares in the purchase of haywood  including the aforementioned  treasury shares 
for an approximate month period ending on or about may   the company has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares as share float permits  which represents the net shares issued in the haywood purchase combination 
the relative interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities indicates the extent to which the company s net interest income may be affected by interest rate movements 
the company s ability to reprice assets and liabilities in the same dollar amounts and at the same time minimizes interest rate risks 
one method of measuring the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income is to measure  in a number of time frames  the interest sensitivity gap  by subtracting interest sensitive liabilities from interest sensitive assets  as reflected in the following table 
such interest sensitivity gap represents the risk  or opportunity  in repricing 
if more assets than liabilities are repriced at a given time in a rising rate environment  net interest income improves  in a declining rate environment  net interest income deteriorates 
conversely  if more liabilities than assets are repriced while interest rates are rising  net interest income deteriorates  if interest rates are falling  net interest income improves 
the company s strategy in minimizing interest rate risk is to minimize the impact of short term interest rate movements on its net interest income while managing its middle and long term interest sensitivity gap in light of overall economic trends in interest rates 
the following table illustrates the relative sensitivity of the company to changing interest rates as of december  interest sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands  except ratios days days one to five years over five years current current cumulative current cumulative current cumulative interest sensitive assets loans        investment securities        interest earning deposits in other banks and federal funds sold     total interest sensitive assets        interest sensitive liabilities interest bearing demand and savings deposits     certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts of or more       other certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts       federal funds purchased  short term borrowings  and long term debt       total interest sensitive liabilities        interest sensitivity gap        ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities amounts exclude unrealized gains losses on investment securities and exclude equity securities  which are not interest sensitive 
the company s strategy is to maintain a ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities in the range of 
to at the less than one year time frame 
at december   the company was slightly below this range 
however  this slight deviation is not considered significant due to the nature of sensitivity 
for example  the ratio in the one year time frame is significantly impacted by the classification of all interest bearing demand and savings deposits as immediately rate sensitive for purposes of this analysis 
these accounts are generally less sensitive to short term interest rate movements 
derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of interest rate swaps and purchased floors  are components of the company s interest risk management profile 
the company uses these instruments to limit its sensitivity to changes in interest rates and thus limit the volatility of net interest income see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
management currently believes its interest sensitivity position is such that short term interest rate movements would not materially impact its net interest income 
inflation inflation impacts the growth in total assets in the banking industry and causes a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates to meet capital adequacy requirements 
the company copes with the effects of inflation through effectively managing its interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting its pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing its dividend payout policy relative to its level of net income 
the impact of inflation has been minimal to the company in recent years 
year the year issue referred generally to the data structure problem that prevents systems from properly recognizing dates after the year for example  computer programs and various types of electronic equipment that process date information by reference to two digits rather than four to define the applicable year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year problem could occur in computer software programs  computer hardware systems  and any device that relies on a computer chip if that chip relies on date information 
even if the systems that process date sensitive data are year compliant  a year problem may exist to the extent that the data that such systems process is not 
in addition to evaluating the year issues relative to its own systems  companies must also assess the ability of the third parties upon which they rely to function on january   and thereafter 
the company appointed a year committee with a full time year coordinator to conduct a comprehensive review of its operational and financial systems to determine how the year would impact operation of these systems 
the committee developed plans to identify all critical systems and developed solutions for all systems that were found to not be year compliant 
the board of directors of each affiliate bank as well as the board of directors of the company reviewed the overall project plans for the banks with progress toward completion monitored regularly 
the company reviewed all testing results to ensure accuracy and complete preparedness 
in addition  comprehensive testing plans were developed to ensure that all critical applications would process normally in the year regular communications procedures were established between the core processing vendor and the company to ensure testing of all applications were completed and thoroughly reviewed 
contingency plans were also enhanced to ensure direction in the event a non compliant system or component was detected 
disaster recovery and business resumption plans were developed based upon each bank s unique structure 
these plans would provide the company with direction in the event an unforeseen circumstance arose due to the year an unforeseen circumstance could have been anything from a vault not opening to a power failure to a natural disaster 
all plans were finalized  tested  and implemented before third quarter customer awareness and preparedness was also a priority 
an employee and customer awareness campaign began on september   and was ongoing through the remainder of and loan relationships that could be materially affected by the year issue were identified and monitored 
liquidity levels were maintained at required levels 
cash reserves for the year issue reached million by december  with no significant cash withdrawals  all of these special year cash reserves were eliminated by january  the company spent approximately million to modify its computer information systems 
the replacement of personal computers and software was approximately  which was recorded as capital expenditures and amortized 
the remainder was expensed as incurred and did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
overall  the company s year program was successful 
no disruption of business occurred due to the year issue 
however  there are several dates that have been and will be closely monitored for the coming year and in the future 
all software and computer related components will continue to be required to undergo year testing and or certification
