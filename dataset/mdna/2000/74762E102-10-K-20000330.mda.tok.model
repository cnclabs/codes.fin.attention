any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements are those discussed in business risk factors in this report 
introduction all share amounts and per share amounts in this discussion have been adjusted to give effect to a for stock split declared by our board of directors on march  and payable on april  to stockholders of record as of march  we derive our revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialized contracting services and offering comprehensive network solutions 
our customers include telecommunications  cable television and electric power companies  as well as commercial  industrial and governmental entities 
including all companies we acquired prior to december   we had pro forma combined revenues for the year ended december  of billion  of which was attributable to telecommunications customers  was attributable to cable television operators  was attributable to electric power companies  and was attributable to ancillary services  such as installing intelligent traffic networks  cable and control systems for light rail lines  airports and highways  and providing specialty rock trenching  directional boring and road milling for industrial and commercial customers 
we acquired companies in  of which have continued as separate operating and reporting subsidiaries  or platform companies  while the remaining eight acquired companies were tuck in acquisitions whose operating and accounting activities were absorbed into other operating subsidiaries 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids  the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are either a lump sum or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project lump sum or for units of work performed unit price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we are generally able to achieve higher margins on lump sum and unit price contracts than on cost plus contracts as a result of our experience in bidding and performance 
our exposure to loss on fixed price contracts has historically been limited by the high volume and relatively short duration of the fixed price contracts we undertake 
however  as we perform larger projects  our reported margins may be significantly affected by actual results on these projects 
we complete most installation projects within one year  while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we generally record revenues from lump sum contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
we recognize revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under fixed price or cost plus fee contracts 
such contracts generally require that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered  measured typically in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a to retainage from each progress payment and forwards the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work 
costs of services consist primarily of salaries and benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  materials  parts and supplies 
our gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  is typically higher on projects where labor  rather than materials  constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services 
we can predict materials costs more accurately than labor costs 
therefore  to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs  we seek to maintain higher margins on labor intensive projects 
certain of our subsidiaries were previously subject to deductibles ranging from  to  for workers compensation insurance and in the future we may have similar large deductibles in our insurance program 
fluctuations in insurance accruals related to these deductibles could have an impact on gross margins in the period in which such adjustments are made 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  office rent and utilities  communications and professional fees 
for those acquisitions we accounted for using the purchase method of accounting through december   we recognized goodwill of million which equaled the excess amount we paid for such businesses over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of such businesses 
in addition  we recorded goodwill of million for the issuance of  shares of limited vote common stock we issued prior to our initial public offering to the initial stockholders and management 
we amortize this million aggregate goodwill over its estimated useful life of years as a non cash charge to operating income 
we are unable to deduct the majority of amortized goodwill from our income for tax purposes 
we expect the pro forma effect of this amortization expense to be approximately million per year 
seasonality  fluctuations of quarterly results our results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations 
during the winter months  demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements may be lower due to reduced construction activity 
however  demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and new maintenance service arrangements 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the us typically  we experience lower gross and operating margins during the winter months 
the timing of acquisitions  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs and regional economic conditions may also materially affect quarterly results 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and long term debt of million  net of current maturities 
our long term debt balance at that date included borrowings of million under our credit facility and million of convertible subordinated notes and million of other debt 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
during the year ended december   operating activities provided net cash to us of million 
acquisitions created the largest changes in our working capital accounts throughout the year and such accounts are not comparable to prior periods 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  including million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired 
financing activities provided net cash of million  resulting primarily from million from net borrowings under our credit facility  million of net proceeds from a january public equity offering and million of net proceeds from the issuance of the series a preferred stock  partially offset by million in repayments of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions 
in january  we completed a public offering of common stock  which included the issuance of  shares of common stock including  shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
we realized proceeds from this transaction  net of the discounts and commissions and after deducting the expenses of the offering  of approximately million 
of this amount  we used million to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility and the remainder to acquire additional businesses 
in june  we expanded our bank group from nine to banks and increased our million credit facility to million 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries and the majority of our assets 
we use the credit facility to provide funds to be used for working capital  to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a libor plus percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility or b the bank s prime rate plus up to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
we owe commitment fees of percent to percent based on total funded debt to ebitda on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our subsidiaries guarantee repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility  and the credit facility restricts pledges of material assets 
we agreed to usual and customary covenants for a credit facility of this nature  including a prohibition on the payment of dividends on common stock  certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants and a requirement to obtain the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration 
in september  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to utilicorp for an initial investment of  before transaction costs 
the series a preferred stock bears a dividend rate of per annum and is convertible into common stock at any time at the option of utilicorp at per share  subject to customary adjustments for certain dilutive events 
we used the net proceeds from the investment to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we also entered into a management services agreement with utilicorp for advice and services including financing activities  corporate strategic planning  research on the restructuring of the power industries  the development  evaluation and marketing of our products  services and capabilities  identification of and evaluation of potential us acquisition candidates and other merger and acquisition advisory services  and other services that we may reasonably request 
in consideration of the advice and services rendered by utilicorp  we agreed to pay utilicorp  on a quarterly basis in arrears  a fee of  the utilicorp management services agreement lasts for six years  but can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties 
we have the right to terminate the management services agreement at any time if  in our reasonable judgment  changes in the nature of our relationship with utilicorp make effective provision of the services to be provided unlikely 
during  we acquired companies for an aggregate consideration of million shares of common stock and million in cash and notes 
the cash portion of such consideration was provided by borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from our january public offering of common stock 
in march  we closed a private placement of senior secured notes with lenders  primarily insurance companies  for million 
the senior secured notes have maturities of five  seven or ten years with a weighted average interest rate of and  pursuant to an intercreditor agreement  rank pari passu in right of repayment with our credit facility indebtedness 
the senior secured notes have financial covenants similar to the credit facility 
we used the proceeds from this private placement to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
accordingly  as of march   we had a borrowing availability of million under the credit facility 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next months 
however  if companies we wish to acquire are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we could be required to utilize more cash to complete acquisitions 
if sufficient funds were not available from operating cash flow or through borrowings under the credit facility  we may be required to seek additional financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that we could secure such financing if and when we need it or on terms we would deem acceptable 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results 
year the company did not experience any significant operational difficulties nor are we aware of any of our suppliers  customers or service providers experiencing any significant operational difficulties as a result of year issues 
we will continue to monitor all critical systems for any incidents of delayed complications or disruptions and problems encountered through third parties with whom we deal so that they may be timely addressed

as such  our financial statements for periods prior to february  are the financial statements of par as restated for the acquisition of the two businesses we acquired in pooling transactions

revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to revenues of million from platform companies acquired in which continued to exist as separate reporting subsidiaries  as well as a full year of contributed revenues in for those companies acquired in we are experiencing strong growth in key business areas as a result of greater demand for bandwidth  increased outsourcing  deregulation and industry convergence 
because the businesses we acquired in and had aggregate revenues that were much larger than our revenues at the beginning of the period  we believe that pro forma revenue growth is a more meaningful measure of our business performance 
operating units we owned as of december  experienced aggregate internal revenue growth on a pro forma combined basis of in and at a compound annual rate of between and gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this increase in our gross margin resulted from a shift in our revenue mix to higher margin cable television and telecommunications services

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the platform companies we acquired in and million was attributable to the implementation in of a company wide incentive program that paid bonuses to management at the operating units that exceeded their performance targets and to corporate management 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included a full year of costs in associated with those companies acquired in the remainder of the increase was attributable to tuck in acquisitions and the continued establishment of infrastructure to facilitate our growth and to integrate our acquired businesses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
our debt with fixed interest rates primarily consists of our convertible subordinated notes issued in september our debt with variable interest rates is primarily our credit facility
