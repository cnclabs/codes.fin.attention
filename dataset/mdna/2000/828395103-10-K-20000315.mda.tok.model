item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding item selected financial data and the company s financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in items and business and properties included elsewhere herein 
overview the company generates revenues primarily from the sale and financing of vacation intervals  including upgraded intervals 
additional revenues are generated from management fees from the management clubs  lease income from sampler sales  and utility operations 
the company recognizes a maximum management fee of of silverleaf club s gross revenues and to of crown club s dues collected  subject to a limitation of each club s net income 
however  if the company does not receive the maximum management fees  such deficiency is deferred for payment in succeeding years  subject again to the net income limitation 
the company recognizes vacation interval sales revenues on the accrual basis 
a sale is recognized after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all criteria are met except that construction is not substantially complete  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  the portion of revenue applicable to costs incurred  as compared to total estimated construction and direct selling costs  is recognized in the period of sale 
the remaining amount is deferred and recognized as vacation interval sales in future periods as the remaining costs are incurred 
at december   approximately  of vacation interval sales transactions were deferred as the minimum down payment had not been received 
the company accounts for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a liability until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as income 
when deposits are ultimately recognized as sales  the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
the company accounts for uncollectible notes by recording a provision to its allowance for uncollectible notes at the time revenue is recognized 
the company classifies the components of the provision for uncollectible notes into the following three categories based on the nature of the item credit losses  customer returns customers that fail to make their first installment payment  and customer releases voluntary cancellations of properly recorded sales transactions which in the opinion of management are consistent with the maintenance of overall customer goodwill 
the provision for uncollectible notes pertaining to credit losses  customer returns  and customer releases is classified in the consolidated statements of income in provision for uncollectible notes  vacation interval sales  and operating  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
the company sets the provision for uncollectible notes at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level which management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the notes 
when inventory is returned to the company  any unpaid notes receivable balances are charged against the previously established bad debt reserves net of the amount at which the vacation interval is restored to inventory  which is the lower of the historical cost basis or market value of the vacation interval 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of resorts including land  construction costs  furniture  interest  and taxes are capitalized and included in inventory 
vacation interval inventory is segregated into three ratings based on customer demand  with greater costs apportioned to higher value ratings 
as vacation intervals are sold  these costs are deducted from inventory on a specific identification basis 
vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded vacation interval 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
vacation intervals which have been reacquired are relieved from inventory on a specific identification basis when resold 
inventory acquired prior to through the company s program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners has a significantly lower average cost basis than recently constructed inventory  contributing significantly to historical operating margins 
new inventory added through the company s construction and acquisition programs has a higher average cost than the company s pre inventory 
accordingly  cost of sales has increased and will continue to increase as sales of new inventory increases relative to overall sales 
the company recognizes interest income as earned 
to the extent interest payments become delinquent  the company ceases recognition of the interest income until collection is probable

hence  the cost of sales as a percentage of vacation interval sales increased compared to sales and marketing sales and marketing costs as a percentage of total sales increased to for the year ended december  from for this increase is primarily due to the implementation of new marketing programs  start up costs in recently opened markets or markets yet to open where sales have not yet reached mature levels to offset costs  and the deferred sales recognition associated with sales at resorts under construction whereby only the direct sales commissions costs related to such sales have been similarly deferred 
provision for uncollectible notes provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to in from in this is the result of improvements in the company s collection efforts  including increased staffing  improved collections software  the implementation of a program through which delinquent loans are assumed by existing owners with a consistent payment history  and an increase in receivables relating to upgrade sales  which typically represent better performing accounts  resulting in fewer delinquencies

results of operations year sales and marketing due to recent growth rates and implementation of new leads generation programs  the company is experiencing higher than anticipated marketing costs in the first quarter of the company has increased its headcount at the call centers significantly since the fourth quarter of  which created inefficiencies due to lack of available training resources 
in addition  the company has moved towards reliance on national retail chains for its leads generation efforts  in addition to the traditional local programs 
the transition to national programs has been slower in generating leads than originally planned 
a major focus of company management in is to improve the efficiencies of the marketing process  which will bring sales and marketing expenses more in line with expectations 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash 
the company generates cash primarily from the cash received on the sale of vacation intervals  the financing of customer notes receivables from silverleaf owners  management fees  sampler sales  and resort and utility operations 
during the years ended december    and  the company s operating activities reflected a use of cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
the company typically receives a down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finances the remainder by receipt of a seven year to ten year customer promissory note 
the company generates cash from the financing of customer notes receivable by i borrowing at an advance rate of to of eligible customer notes receivable and ii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because the company uses significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals  but collects cash on customer notes receivable over a seven year to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during  the increase in cash provided by financing activities to million from million in was primarily due to increased borrowings against pledged notes receivable during the year ended december   compared to the company s revolving credit facilities provide for loans of up to million 
at december   approximately million of principal and interest related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding 
of this amount  million  million  million  million  and million matures in     and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings  including the senior subordinated debt  was 
customer defaults have a significant impact on cash available to the company from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  the company must repay borrowings against such delinquent notes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  the company reports substantially all of the vacation interval sales it finances under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest is imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the related tax is paid 
if the company is otherwise not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense which would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not estimable 
in addition  the company is subject to current alternative minimum tax amt as a result of the deferred income which results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales  and creates a deferred tax asset 
in  the internal revenue service approved a change in the method of accounting for installment sales effective as of january  as a result  the company s alternative minimum taxable income for through was or will be increased each year by approximately million for the pre adjustment  which results in the company paying substantial additional federal and state taxes in those years 
the company s net operating loss carryforwards  which also may be used to offset installment sales income  expire beginning in through realization of the deferred tax asset arising from net operating losses is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards and other factors 
uses of cash 
investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash because of loans to customers in connection with the company s vacation interval sales  capital additions  and property acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities increased significantly in each period primarily due to significant increases in customer notes receivable 
operating and investing activities also use cash because the company requires funds to construct infrastructure  amenities  and additional units at the existing resorts and new resorts  to acquire property for future resort development  and to support current operations 
in  the increase in cash used in operating and investing activities was also attributed to investments in a new central telemarketing facility and related automated dialers and computer equipment  as well as investments in undeveloped land  including million of undeveloped land near the villages resort in tyler  texas   of undeveloped land near holiday hills resort in branson  missouri  and  of undeveloped land near fox river resort in sheridan  illinois 
the acquisition of the fox river  timber creek  and oak n spruce resorts and the las vegas and galveston sites in  and the acquisition of the crown resorts  the atlanta  kansas city  and philadelphia sites  and a second parcel of land in galveston in  also contributed to the increases in cash used in operating and investing activities in those years 
the company acquired the fox river and timber creek resorts in august for million  the site in las vegas  nevada  in november for million  one tract of the galveston property in december for  and the oak n spruce resort in massachusetts in december for million 
the company acquired a second tract of the galveston property in february for million  the crown resorts in may for million  the kansas city site in september for million  the philadelphia site in december for million  and various tracts of the atlanta property throughout the fourth quarter of for million 
also  in the third and fourth quarter of  the company reacquired  shares of its common stock for approximately million 
the company evaluates sites for additional new resorts or acquisitions on an ongoing basis 
as of december   the company had construction commitments of approximately million 
certain debt agreements include restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
the company believes that with respect to its current operations and capital commitments  its borrowing capacity under certain existing or renegotiated third party lending agreements  together with cash generated from operations and future borrowings  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs for the year ended december  however  depending upon conditions in capital and other financial markets  and other factors including the company s growth  development  and expansion plans  the company may from time to time consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collaterized mortgage backed securities  the proceeds of which would be used to finance future acquisitions  refinance debt  finance mortgage receivables  or for other purposes 
any debt incurred or issued by the company may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as management deems prudent 
inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenues  operating income  and net income during any of the company s three most recent fiscal years 
however  to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be affected as well as the rates the company charges on its customer notes receivable
