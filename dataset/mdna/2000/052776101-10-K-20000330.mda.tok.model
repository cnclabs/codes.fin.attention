based upon its budget for the calendar year  the company believes that current cash and marketable securities and the interest earned from the investment thereof will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements for at least five years 
at the appropriate time  the company may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from other sources 
if additional funds are necessary but not available  the company will have to reduce certain areas of research  product development  manufacturing or marketing activity  or otherwise modify its business strategy
