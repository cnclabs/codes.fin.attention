the company currently has joint ventures covering four networks with local partners where the company owns of each joint venture 
as a result of the company s historic ownership position in these and other joint ventures  a substantial portion of the networks historic results have been reported by the company on the equity method of accounting for investments which only reflects the company s pro rata share of net income or loss of the networks 
because of the recently completed partner roll ups  management of the company believes this historical presentation of the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the company does not represent a complete measure of the financial position  growth or operations of the company 
in order to provide an additional measure of the financial position  growth and performance of the company and its networks  management of the company analyzes financial information of the consolidated networks and the non consolidated joint venture networks on a combined basis

while ebitda is not an alternative to operating income as an indicator of operating performance or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity  all as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and while ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies  the company s management believes ebitda is a meaningful measure of performance 
b not meaningful liquidity and capital resources the development of the company s business and the installation and expansion of the networks  as well as the development of the markets  combined with the construction and expansion of the company s nocc  have resulted in substantial capital expenditures and investments during the past several years 
capital expenditures by the company were million and million for the nine months ended december  and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
further  investments made by the company in nonconsolidated networks and in lmds licenses were million and million for the nine months ended december  and the year ended december   respectively 
the significant increase in capital expenditures for the year ended december  is largely attributable to capital expenditures necessary to develop the original markets and the new markets  as well as the fiber purchases to interconnect the networks 
the company expects that it will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures in this development effort 
the company also expects to continue to fund operating losses as the company develops and grows its business 
for information regarding recent transactions affecting the company s liquidity and capital resources  see financing transactions and acquisitions of partners interests above 
the company has experienced negative operating and investing cash flow since its inception 
a combination of operating losses  substantial capital investments required to build the company s networks and its state of the art nocc  and incremental investments in the joint ventures has resulted in substantial negative cash flow 
expansion of the company s original markets and services and the development of new markets and additional networks and services requires significant capital expenditures 
the company s operations have required and will continue to require substantial capital investment for i the installation of electronics for switched services in the company s networks  ii the expansion and improvement of the company s nocc and original markets  iii the design  construction and development of new markets and iv the acquisition of additional ownership interests in the original markets 
the company has made substantial capital investments and investments in joint ventures in connection with the installation of ess switches or remote switching modules in all of its original markets and plans to install regional super switches in certain key new markets when such new markets are operational 
to date  the company has installed switches in all of its original markets and plans to provide such services in all of its new markets on a standard switching platform based on lucent switch technology 
in addition  the company intends to increase spending on marketing and sales significantly in the foreseeable future in connection with the expansion of its sales force and marketing efforts generally 
the company also plans to purchase its partners interest in the joint ventures when it can do so at attractive economic terms 
the company estimates that  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents on hand  demand loans to adelphia and the us government securities pledged as of december   a total of approximately million will be required to fund the company s capital expenditures  working capital requirements  operating losses and pro rata investments in the joint ventures from january  through the quarter ending december  in addition  there can be no assurance i that the company s future cash requirements will not vary significantly from those presently planned due to a variety of factors including acquisition of additional networks  continued acquisition of increased ownership in its networks  material variances from expected capital expenditure requirements for original markets and new markets and development of the lmds spectrum  or ii that anticipated financings  local partner investments and other sources of capital will become available to the company on economically attractive terms or at all 
in addition  it is possible that expansion of the company s networks may include the geographic expansion of the company s existing clusters and the development or acquisition of other new markets not currently planned 
the company will need substantial additional funds to fully fund its business plan 
the company expects to fund its capital requirements through existing resources  credit facilities and vendor financings at the company and joint venture levels  internally generated funds  equity invested by local partners in joint ventures and additional debt or equity financings  as appropriate  and expects to fund any potential additional purchase of partnership interests of local partners through existing resources  internally generated funds and additional debt or equity financings  as appropriate 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will be successful in generating sufficient cash flow or in raising sufficient debt or equity capital on terms that it will consider acceptable  or at all
