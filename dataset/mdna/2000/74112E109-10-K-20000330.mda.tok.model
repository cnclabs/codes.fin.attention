overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
there are two broad product classes diagnostic products and laboratory instruments 
diagnostic products consist of three groups quality control panels  accurun r run controls  and diagnostic components 
services consist of specialty clinical laboratory testing  contract research  blood processing and repository services  clinical trials  laboratory instrumentation services  after sales service and drug screening 
historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures  and seasonal demand during the summer months for certain laboratory testing services 
in particular  the company s sales of its off the shelf quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas oem product sales may peak in any quarter of the year  depending on the production cycle of a given project 
specialty clinical laboratory testing services have generally reached a seasonal peak during the third quarter  coinciding with the peak incidence of lyme disease 
research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result these contracts can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
with the acquisition of bioseq  inc and its pressure cycling technology in september as well as the hiring of a vice president for the drug discovery and development program and its subsequent formation of a new subsidiary panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  the company has significantly increased its rate of research and development spending on new technologies 
in addition  it has continued to focus on the development of new quality control products and new tests for its clinical laboratory 
additional sales and support will be added as needed with the expectation of continued future revenue growth 
the company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december revenue products services total revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development acquired research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses loss income from operations interest income expense loss income before income taxes net loss income product gross profit services gross profit years ended december  and total revenue increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of an increase in product revenue of or  to  from  and an increase in service revenue of or  to  from  in most of the product increase was attributable to the following factors 
the diagnostics segment realized a increase in accurun r sales as the company continued to successfully penetrate the emerging end user market 
in addition  the increased outsourcing occurring in the in vitro diagnostics industry has resulted in a increase in basematrix sales 
the laboratory instrumentation segment achieved a increase in instrument sales as it refocused its efforts in oem contract manufacturing 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in seroconversion panel sales  realized by the diagnostics segment  as the consolidation within the in vitro diagnostic industry continues to negatively affect demand for these products 
the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to a revenue increase at the clinical laboratory services segment 
the growth in this segment was led by a increase in molecular testing 
also contributing to the growth in the service revenue was contract research within the bbi biotech operating segment 
this growth was driven by a increase in repository services and the start of new contracts in the aids vaccine support arena 
these increases were partially offset by an decrease in laboratory instrumentation services as the company completed its work on the abx  inc  contract in the first quarter of management feels that the end user market will continue to be an area of growth for its quality control products while the outsourcing within the in vitro diagnostics market will continue to benefit sales of diagnostic components and laboratory instrumentation 
the company also anticipates that new contracts at the bbi biotech segment and molecular testing at the clinical laboratory segment will also contribute to revenue growth 
overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and product gross margin increased to in  from in services gross profit decreased  to  in from  in and gross margin declined to in from in the increase in product gross margin was due entirely to the gross margins realized in the laboratory instrumentation operating segment  which increased from in to in as the business unit operated at a higher volume  thus realizing better economies of scale compared with as overhead costs were spread over a greater number of units 
product gross margins at the other segments remained relatively steady 
management anticipates that further utilization increases at bbi source will continue to benefit gross margins 
the decrease in service gross margins was realized at all operating segments 
the bbi biotech segment s service gross margin decreased from to 
bbi biotech margins were adversely affected by startup costs associated with new repository contracts in  primarily the acquisition of freezers  which under the terms of the contract become government property and thus are charged directly to cost of sales 
also  the clinical laboratory services segment realized service gross margins of in versus in this decrease is due to increased competition in the molecular testing arena  which created pricing pressure  negatively affecting margins 
finally  in early  the laboratory instruments segment realized a decrease in service gross margins from to  as it completed the high margin abx  inc  contract in early the company feels that service margins will continue to feel pressure from increased competition in the clinical testing market 
furthermore as bbi biotech expands its repository services  low margin contracts will account for a greater portion of its total revenue if the company is not continually successful in obtaining higher margin commercial services work 
research and development costs  exclusive of acquired in process research and development  increased or  to  in from  in a significant portion of the increase is attributable to the operating segment referred to as other  which consists of the pressure cycling technology pct and drug discovery activities 
the company increased its pct expenditures by approximately  as it completed the design  development  and manufacture of prototype pct instruments known as barocylcers 
the company also made significant progress during with its patents in the nucleic acid extraction and pathogen inactivation areas 
the company s increased expenditures in drug discovery by approximately  resulted in expanded rights under its agreement with the university of north carolina  at chapel hill  and significant progress in the prosecution of patents for the compounds 
in addition  the bbi biotech segment increased its spending to continue its support of the diagnostics and clinical laboratory services segments 
there were two accounting charges in  which were classified on the income statement as acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter there was an accounting charge of  related to the acquisition of the worldwide exclusive rights to bioseq  inc s  immunodiagnostic research and development technology 
in the third quarter  the company recorded a charge of  related to in process technology as a result of the company s acquisition of bioseq  inc this allocation of the purchase price was based on an independent valuation and was expensed  as no alternative future uses exist 
there were no such charges during selling and marketing expenditures remained relatively flat during as compared to  across all operating segments 
costs increased only or  to  in from  in as the company effectively managed costs in this area 
general and administrative costs increased or  to  in from  in this increase is attributable to the corporate reorganization that was announced in july of the reorganization created business units  which are directed by a senior vice president and general manager 
the reorganization resulted in the classification of the salaries  and other related costs  of two executives in the general and administrative line of the income statement from other income statement lines  to more accurately reflect their new responsibilities 
general and administrative costs are expected to increase in  as the reorganization impact will be felt for the entire fiscal year in addition  benefited as certain general and administrative personnel costs were capitalized as property and equipment in connection with the implementation of enterprise resource planning systems at the diagnostics and laboratory instruments segments 
general and administrative costs at the other segments were flat 
as a result of all of the above  the company experienced an operating loss of  versus  in excluding the  of acquired in process research and development charges realized in  the company s operating loss increased by or  to  in from  in the diagnostics operating segment realized an increase in operating income of approximately  or and clinical laboratory services operating segments realized a significant increase in operating income of approximately  or 
the laboratory instrumentation segment realized a slight reduction   in its operating loss 
these operational improvements were more than offset by the planned increases in research and development expenditures  which resulted in significant operating losses in the other operating segment 
another result of the company s increased research and development investment is the  decrease in operating income realized by the bbi biotech operating segment as the business unit realized an operating loss in of approximately  as compared to operating income in of approximately  management anticipates continued strength from its diagnostics and clinical laboratory services segments 
although the laboratory instrumentation segment has realized operating losses since it was acquired in july  the company believes that the goodwill created in connection with the acquisition is realizable as management believes that the segment will begin to generate operating income by the end of the company will continue to increase its spending in the other segment  however  it expects that the impact from this increased spending on the company s bottom line will be mitigated by the planned sale of the common stock of panacos and the continued funding support in the area of pct 
the company had net interest expense of  in versus  in the company had used its proceeds from its initial public offering and  at the end of the second quarter of  began to borrow funds from its revolving line of credit to continue its infrastructure and research and development investments 
in addition to a higher average borrowing balance in  the company realized the effects of rising interest rates 
the company recorded tax benefits at its combined federal and state statutory rate of for although the company realized consolidated operating losses for and management believes that its valuation allowance is adequate as the company plans to return to profitability within six to twelve months  at which point it will begin to realize benefit from its federal and state tax assets 
the tax benefit rate recognized in was adversely affected by the in process research and development charges discussed above 
the march technology license transaction resulted in a temporary difference as the technology license is deductible for tax purposes over a year period  while the september common stock acquisition resulted in a permanent difference that is never deductible 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item hereunder for further detail 
the company had a net loss of  in versus  in as a result of the operating loss  the interest expense  and the effective tax rate described above 
years ended december  and in july the company acquired the business of source scientific  inc the acquisition was completed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  bbi source scientific  inc  bbi source and was accounted for as an asset purchase 
the income statement for includes the results of bbi source for the last six months of the year  effecting comparability of results with total revenue increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of an increase in product revenue of  to  from  and a increase in service revenue of  to  from  in most of the product increase was attributable to increased sales of quality control products achieved by the diagnostics segment 
the increase in such products was led by accurun r which doubled in sales over the prior year 
also contributing to the increase in product sales was the inclusion of bbi source the laboratory instruments segment for the full year in versus a half year in the decrease in quality control panel sales at the diagnostics segment partially offset the product sales increases  as sales fell short of expectations due to consolidation in the in vitro diagnostic test kit industry 
the bbi biotech segment led the increase in service revenue with a increase in contract research 
also contributing to the increase in service revenue was the clinical laboratory testing segment  realizing a increase in revenue 
overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in product gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  in and product gross margin decreased to in from 
in the diagnostics segment s product gross margin benefited from significant one time sale of two world wide panels  which have unusually high gross margins due to their unique characteristics 
these panels sold out in the first quarter of  with minimal impact on the remaining product gross margin decrease was the result of lower capacity utilization at the laboratory instrumentation segment 
services gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and gross margin remained steady at in and higher margins generated by the contract services and laboratory instrumentation segments offset the decrease in margins realized by the increased pricing pressure facing the clinical laboratory testing segment research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was realized across all of the segments 
the laboratory instrumentation segment invested in new reflectance technology for its verif eye product line 
the diagnostics segments also increased its development expenditures  specifically for development of accurun r molecular and immunological run controls 
the company invested in development of new specialized molecular assays for use by the clinical laboratory testing segment 
finally  the company began the development of pct as it acquired bioseq  inc one component of the other segment in september there were two accounting charges during the twelve months ended december   which were classified on the income statement as acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter there was an accounting charge of  related to the acquisition of the worldwide exclusive rights to bioseq inc s immunodiagnostic research and development technology 
in the third quarter  the company recorded a charge of  related to in process technology as a result of the company s  acquisition of bioseq  inc selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was attributable primarily to inclusion for a full year in of the expanded tqs sales  marketing  and technical support staff added to the diagnostics segment in the spring of the company also expanded its presence at tradeshows  resulting in higher expenditures in this category 
general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was attributable primarily to additional support staff  and increased information systems consulting and investor relations activities at the diagnostics segment  which includes the majority of the corporate functions and officers for both periods 
in addition  the inclusion of the laboratory instrumentation segment for a full year added  of expense to this category 
as a result of all of the above  the company experienced an operating loss of  versus income of  in this decrease was primarily a result of the acquired in process research and development expense  a higher operating loss at the laboratory instrumentation segment  increased research and development expenditures at all segments  and lower profitability at its diagnostics and clinical laboratory testing operating segments 
the company had net interest expense of  in versus interest income of  in the company had used the proceeds from its initial public offering and  at the end of the second quarter of  began to borrow funds from its revolving line of credit to continue its infrastructure and research and development investments 
the company provided taxes at the combined federal and state rate of for versus in the prior year 
the rate decrease was the result of offsetting the massachusetts taxable income of the diagnostics operating segment with the massachusetts losses of bbi bioseq  inc  this benefit was adversely impacted by the tax treatment of the acquired in process technology from bioseq  inc as the acquisition was structured as a stock purchase 
therefore  the effective benefit rate for was approximately 
the company had a net loss of  in versus net income of  in as a result of the operating loss described above and a shift to interest expense in versus interest income in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and working capital of  gross trade accounts receivable increased  or as a result of a increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of versus the same period in inventory increased  or  related primarily to work in process for upcoming projects within the diagnostics segment 
the company has financed its operations to date through cash flow from operations  borrowings from banks and the sale of its common stock 
the company expects its cash flow  working capital  and available borrowings under its revolving line of credit to meet existing operational needs in in mid the company and its bank agreed to a modified borrowing agreement with revised financial covenants  which the company expects will meet existing operational needs for the foreseeable future 
at december  the company was in compliance with its financial covenants 
in addition  in march the company received a signed term sheet from a bank for a mortgage of the company s west bridgewater  ma facility 
the company anticipates that it will complete the transaction in the beginning of the second quarter of the company intends to use the  of cash generated to pay down its existing line of credit 
net cash used in operations for was  as compared to  in this decrease in operational use of cash is due to improved management of working capital  including better utilization of inventory and more effective management of payables and receivables 
the  increase in reserve for doubtful accounts partially offset this improvement of operational cash flow 
the company increased its reserve because there has been a gradual shift in the company s customer mix from large  well known  in vitro diagnostics manufacturers to a more diversified customer matrix  which includes smaller  less established companies 
while the company has not yet experienced a significant increase in write off s as a result of this shift  management feels that establishing the current level of reserve is prudent 
cash used in investing activities for  and amounted to   and  respectively 
substantially all of the investing activities in related to additions of property and equipment 
these expenditures included approximately  of computer hardware and software  including approximately  invested in new enterprise resource planning systems for the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments 
the bbi biotech segment spent approximately  on leasehold improvements as it prepared a new facility in frederick  maryland for the repository contract with the national institute of allergy and infectious disease  division of aids 
in addition  the company continued construction at its bbi diagnostics facility in west bridgewater  massachusetts as it spent approximately  improving this manufacturing facility 
in  three major items accounted for most of the company s investing activities 
first  effective september   the company completed the acquisition of the remaining common stock of bioseq  inc  for a cash expenditure of  second   was expended for additional improvements at the company s massachusetts and maryland facilities 
finally   was spent on software  hardware and implementation costs for the enterprise resource planning system 
in  four items accounted for most of the investing activities 
first  the company exercised its option to purchase an additional  shares of bioseq  inc stock at an aggregate cost of  thereby increasing its ownership of bioseq to 
second  in may  the company s bbi biotech subsidiary signed a ten year lease for new laboratory space in gaithersburg  maryland and spent  on leasehold improvements for new laboratory space for its contract research and product development activities 
third  the expansion and renovation of its bbi diagnostics manufacturing facility in west bridgewater  massachusetts  commenced construction and approximately  was expended 
finally  the company completed the acquisition of source scientific  inc at a purchase price of  including acquisition costs 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  from a combination of net borrowings of  under the revolving line of credit  and proceeds of  from the sale of stock and stock warrants to third party investors 
in addition  the company realized proceeds of  and  from the sale of stock and the exercise of stock options  respectively 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was  from a combination of net borrowings of  under the revolving line of credit  and proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
during  net cash generated from financing activities included  from the exercise of warrants  and  from exercising stock options 
also in   was used to pay down debt acquired in connection with the source acquisition 
the company anticipates significant capital expenditures in to continue as it plans to compete renovations to its manufacturing facility in massachusetts and its repository facility in frederick  maryland 
in addition to the renovations  the company intends to continue its enterprise resource planning system implementation  as it installs new systems at bbicl and bbi biotech 
the company believes that existing cash balances  the borrowing capacity available under the revolving line of credit  cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of its common stock are sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures in except for purchase orders in connection with the manufacturing expansion  there were no material financial commitments for capital expenditures as of december  in february of  the company received notice that certain warrant holders exercised  warrants 
this exercise will result in proceeds to the company of approximately  net of transaction costs  when the transaction closes  pursuant to completing the registration of the underlying shares

any such interruption could have a material adverse impact on the future results of the company 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas is effective  as amended for quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company does not currently engage in derivative trading or hedging activity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk in connection with its long term debt 
the aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the company at december  that are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of percent is less than  after tax 
the hypothetical loss was determined by calculating the aggregate impact of a percent increase in the interest rate of each variable rate financial instrument held by the company at december   that is subject to interest rate risk 
fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated  as the company believes the risk exposure is not material 
the company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is significant as the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers however this risk is mitigated by the dispersion across different industries and geographies in which the customers operate  in addition to this  the largest customer approximately of consolidated revenue was the nih  a us government agency 
the company is exposed to credit related risks associated with its trade accounts receivable denominated in us dollars but receivable from foreign customers
