year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and cost of revenue revenue for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the lack of a transaction comparable to the sale of approximately million of prepaid licenses to xl vision  inc during coupled with a reduction in post contract services revenue of approximately  due to the company s decision to divest itself of contracts to manage the identification and authentication aspects of the connecticut and new jersey welfare systems in early the approximately  decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue 
gross profit decreased to  or of revenue during from million or of revenue in primarily due to the change in the mix of product revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses for decreased by approximately  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in commissions and depreciation as well as the expiration of our obligation to make minimum royalty payments of  per quarter to cogent systems  inc these decreases were partially offset by increased operating costs associated with personnel increases initiated during the fourth quarter of the following table provides a breakdown of the dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses changes in operating expenses s percent product development sales and marketing minimum royalties general and administrative product development the increase in product development expenses was primarily due to a fourth quarter increase of approximately  as we added staff to enhance current products and develop new products to meet anticipated demand for our products as organizations begin to redirect their information technology expenditures from yk remediation efforts to enhanced internet and network security solutions 
we expect significant additional increases in product development expenses as we expand our product development efforts in sales and marketing the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the lack of commissions comparable to the approximately  commission paid on sales to xl vision in this reduction was partially offset by increases in travel and entertainment and advertising expenses as we increased our efforts to promote our internet and network security products beginning in we expect significant additional increases in sales and marketing expenses as we expand our sales and marketing activities in general and administrative the decrease in general administrative expense was centered in depreciation expense and was primarily due to the final write off of assets acquired for research and development activities in prior years 
we expect certain general and administrative costs to increase as we add infrastructure to support our increased product development and sales and marketing activities 
interest and other income the  decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to a  decrease in gain on sale of certain fixed assets  partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher cash available for investment in interest bearing overnight repurchase agreements

approximately million or of total revenue was from commercial software sales during compared to  or in resulting from our shift to focusing on software based solutions during government related project revenue  including both pcs and product revenue  associated with the states of new jersey and connecticut welfare control systems increased to approximately  in from approximately  in as the result of a system expansion installed for the state of new jersey in as part of our increased focus on commercial software development and sales  we entered into agreements during the first quarter of to i transfer our contractual responsibilities for the management of the identification and authentication aspects of the connecticut welfare system to the prime contractor  polaroid corporation  and ii sell our software and transfer the contractual responsibilities for the management of the identification and authentication aspects of the new jersey welfare system to a third party contractor  image computing incorporated 
these new resellers have agreed to purchase software support through the balance of the approximately  increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to the sale of approximately  of hardware to xl vision  at cost  as part of the agreement making xl vision a master reseller to the healthcare market 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue during from  or of revenue in primarily due to the change in product mix to primarily software sales in operating expenses operating expenses for decreased by approximately million from primarily due to i the expense reduction plan implemented in late  ii the sale of our healthcare line of business to xl vision in  and iii the elimination of expenses outside our current strategic focus on indirect sales and marketing of software products 
the following table provides a breakdown of the dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses changes in operating expenses s change product development sales and marketing  general and administrative product development the decrease in product development expenses was primarily due to reductions in employee expense  travel and professional consulting services related to hardware and the elimination of expenditures outside of our current strategic focus 
we expect to continue to incur product development costs as we develop additional products and enhance existing products 
sales and marketing the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to reductions in employee expense  travel  professional consulting services and advertising  partially offset by a one time commission paid in connection with the xl vision transactions 
as part of the current strategic focus  we sold our healthcare line of business  eliminated a portion of our other sales and marketing staff and closed certain offices shifting such sales and marketing efforts and costs to certain of our strategic partners 
general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the accrual of  of settlement costs related to the iig lawsuit in compared to  of such costs in as well as decreases in employee expense  travel  outside consulting  telephone and legal and professional expense 
we expect certain general and administrative costs to increase if sales of our products increase 
interest and other income this decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to a  write off of obsolete assets and a  reduction in interest income due to lower cash balances partially offset by a  gain on sale of assets transferred to xl vision during operating expense analysis by functional activity the following table provides an analysis of the over change in total operating expense by functional category changes in operating expenses s change compensation and related benefits  legal and professional services consulting travel and entertainment advertising and promotion telephone and internet commission other not meaningful year exposure the year problem was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
we recognized the need to ensure that our operations would not be adversely impacted by year software failures and therefore took appropriate action to address the potential impact of the year problem 
we have not experienced  and we do not expect to experience  any systems failures or other losses as a result of the yk problem and addressing potential problems did not have a material adverse impact on our business  condition financial or otherwise  results of operations  prospects  or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital as of december  were approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to cash and working capital of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  shares of common stock  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  for  on july  and the issuance of  shares of series d preferred stock to rms limited partnership see factor that may affect future results several stockholders have the ability to control the vote of our stock below for an aggregate purchase price of million on november   partially offset by operating losses 
we expended cash at a rate of approximately  per month during the last three months of cash as of march  was approximately million 
cash and working capital as of february  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease from december   was primarily due to net operating expenses  partially offset by proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
in an effort to minimize our net cash expenditure rate during and  we continued a plan to reduce operating expenses which was initiated in september this plan included  among other things  closing certain corporate facilities outside our tampa headquarters and reducing the number of employees 
we used cash of approximately million for operating activities in compared to approximately  in the increased use of cash was primarily due to the sale of prepaid software licenses to one customer that generated approximately million in cash in with no comparable transaction in we expended net cash at a rate of approximately  per month excluding approximately  of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants during january and february of we believe that our existing working capital  together with anticipated cash flows from sales under current contracts will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs into the year absent a significant increase in sales  which itself may require a significant increase in working capital  we will require significant additional funds to continue our operations into the year the options we are reviewing to obtain additional financing include  but are not limited to  the sale and issuance of stock  the sale and issuance of debt  the sale of certain of our assets and entering into an additional strategic relationship or relationships to either obtain the needed funding or to create what we believe would be a better opportunity to obtain such funds 
in addition  we are seeking to raise additional capital to accelerate our product development and sales and marketing efforts as well as to redeem the series d convertible preferred stock 
it is possible that any such additional infusion of capital would be in the form of the sale and issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible into our common stock  which would substantially increase the number of shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis 
the failure to obtain such additional funds could cause us to cease or curtail operations 
even if such additional funding is obtained  there is no assurance that we will be able to generate significant sales of our products or services  or  if we are able to consummate significant sales  that any such sales would be profitable 
factors that may affect future results in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k  the following factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect our actual results and could cause future results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
factors that could cause future results to differ from expectations include  but are not limited to the following our need for additional funds  our limited operating history and substantial accumulated net losses  control of saflink  the nasdaq smallcap market eligibility and maintenance requirements  technological and market uncertainty  competition  our dependence upon software licensors  our dependence on key employees  volatility of the market price of our common stock  our acquisition strategy  growth in the biometric technology market and acceptance of our products in these markets  failure of our marketing partners to promote our products  and our dividend policy 
we will need additional funds to maintain our operations and the terms of the additional financing may restrict our operations 
we believe that our existing working capital  together with anticipated cash flows from sales from current contracts may be insufficient to meet our expected working capital needs beyond the year we also expect to make continued investments in researching  developing and engineering our systems  software and products to remain competitive 
if we need additional working capital and are not generating sufficient additional profitable sales of our products or services  we may need to issue additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into common stock 
our issuances of these securities could dilute the interests of stockholders 
additional financing may be unavailable to us or only available on terms unacceptable to us 
the terms of available financing may restrict our operations 
we have a limited operating history during which we have accumulated substantial net losses and we may sustain substantial losses in the future 
from our commencement of business in october  we have been principally engaged in organizational  developmental and marketing activities 
through december   we have reported an accumulated net loss of approximately million 
we have continued to accumulate losses after december  to date and we may be unable to generate significant revenues or any net income in the future 
several stockholders have the ability to control the vote of our stock rms limited partnership  a nevada limited partnership controlled by roy m 
speer rms and francis r 
santangelo  acting together  are in a position immediately to exercise significant control over the general affairs of saflink  to control the vote on any matters presented to stockholders and to direct the business and policies of saflink 
as of march   rms and mr 
santangelo beneficially owned approximately and of our common stock  respectively 
mr 
santangelo and rms are parties to a certain stockholders voting agreement pursuant to which they agreed to vote certain shares for directors nominated by rms  and not to vote in favor of certain specified actions unless agreed to by rms 
in addition  rms owns  shares of our series d preferred stock which are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock and  if converted  would result in rms beneficially owning approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market if we fail to comply with the eligibility and maintenance requirements during  we received letters from the nasdaq stock market  inc notifying us that our common stock was not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c rule c  which requires us to maintain a minimum bid price for our common stock 
we believe that as of march   we are in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in rule c 
also during  we received letters from nasdaq notifying us that our common stock was not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c rule c  which requires us to i maintain net tangible assets of million  ii maintain a market capitalization of million  or iii have recorded net income of  in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
we believe that as of march   we are in compliance with rule c 
there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with rule c or rule c at any time in the future or that our common stock will not be delisted from the smallcap market 
if our common stock was delisted from the smallcap market  it would adversely affect i the prices of such securities  ii the ability of holders to sell them  and iii our ability to raise additional funds  especially in the public markets 
technological and market uncertainty may limit our ability to produce and sell our products and services various problems may impede the development  production  distribution and marketing of our products and services 
we may be limited by our financial and technical abilities in trying to solve these problems 
more advanced or alternate technology employed by competitors that is unavailable to us could give those competitors a significant advantage over us 
it is possible that products and services developed by our competitors will significantly limit the potential market for our products and services or render our products and services obsolete 
in addition  laws  rules  regulations or industry standards may be adopted which would require us to modify our products or services or which may otherwise materially adversely affect us 
rapid changes in technology may require us to modify our products and services technology employed in our industry is subject to rapid change 
our future success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with a changing marketplace 
we will have to integrate new technology into our software and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the changing needs of the marketplace 
we may not be able to successfully compete in the highly competitive market for network and internet security software we compete in the highly competitive market for network and internet security software and we expect this competition to intensify as the biometric industry continues to develop 
this security market is dominated by more traditional non biometric identification and authentication techniques  such as cards  keys  passwords and personal information 
a number of other companies currently offer systems in the united states incorporating biometric authentication methods 
in addition  several other companies produce or are developing other biometric technologies which may compete with us and our technology and may be integrated into authentication products and services that are competitive with those we offer 
some examples of these technologies are identification by eye retina blood vessel patterns  hand geometry and signature analysis 
we compete with companies that have substantially greater resources than us and are better equipped than us 
we may be unable to compete successfully against these companies or their products and services 
announcements and advances by our competitors concerning new products or features  governmental or other contracts and developments or disputes relative to patents or proprietary rights may also have an adverse material impact on our business  results of operations and prospects 
we are dependent on licenses of software from third parties we have licensed rights to biometric technologies under agreements with software algorithm suppliers including itt industries  inc  learnout hauspie speech products nv  veridicom  inc and visionics corporation 
these rights may be terminated if we fail to pay required license fees or commit any other material breach of these agreements 
while we believe we are not in default of these agreements as of the date of this report  there is no assurance that defaults will not occur in the future or that we will make the minimum royalty payments required under these agreements 
our products can be and are sold without the biometric technology we have licensed 
however  any loss of our license rights could substantially impair or entirely preclude our ability to compete with products including this technology 
our success is dependent on our ability to retain key employees and to attract high quality new employees all of our employees have at will employment agreements and may leave without notice 
we rely heavily on stock options to provide a meaningful retention incentive to existing and new employees 
as of march   unvested options held by senior management and all other employees are  and  respectively  which represent a and a ownership interest in our company on a fully diluted basis 
the inability to offer competitive compensation packages including continued stock option awards could have a material adverse effect on our recruiting and retention of key employees 
as of march   there were  shares of common stock available for issuance under our stock option plan and there is no assurance that stockholders will approve an amendment to the plan to increase the number of shares that may be awarded 
shares eligible for future sale could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and the market price for our stock as of march    shares of our common stock were outstanding  of which substantially all may be resold in the public market immediately 
in addition  the remaining shares of common stock are available for resale in the public market under rule sales of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that sales would occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
these sales or perceptions of possible sales could also impair our future ability to raise capital 
in part as a result of sales or the perception of the possibility of sales of common stock  the market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile 
it is possible that this volatility will have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
there is a limited public market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that there will be active public trading for our common stock in the future there is a limited public market for our common stock 
the average daily trading volume of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market over the past five years has been approximately  shares 
the public trading market for our common stock has been limited  and the market price for our common stock may not necessarily reflect our value 
there may not be any active public trading market for our common stock in the future 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile the market price of our common stock has been volatile and may be volatile in the future 
the market price of our common stock may be impacted by events related to technology companies generally 
factors and events  including the following  may contribute to volatility and may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock o our announcements or announcements by our competitors concerning new product developments  governmental contracts or other contracts  o developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  and o potential governmental regulation 
we are exploring implementing an acquisition strategy with which we have no experience we are exploring a growth strategy that could include acquisitions of companies involved in related businesses including e commerce and the internet 
we may not identify appropriate targets and we may not consummate any transactions 
any growth may result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders by the issuance of equity based securities 
any acquisitions would place substantial demands on our management  working capital and financial and management control systems 
success of any future expansion plans will depend in part upon our ability to integrate the new business segments and to continue to improve and expand management and financial control systems and to attract  retain and motivate personnel equipped to manage corporate changes 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully manage these risks 
if we fail to adequately manage the growth of the business  it could have a severe negative impact on our financial results and stock price 
our success will be dependent on significant growth in the biometric market and broad acceptance of products in these markets all of our revenues are derived from the sale of products and services that utilize biometric technologies 
our software products represent a new approach to identity verification  which has only been used in limited applications to date 
biometric security products have not gained widespread commercial acceptance 
our success depends on the development and expansion of markets for biometric products both domestically and internationally 
further  our products may not achieve sufficient market acceptance to ensure our viability 
in addition  we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate of this industry or the ultimate size of the biometric technology market 
the expansion of the market for our products depends on a number of factors including o the cost  performance and reliability of our products and the products of our competitors  o customers perception of the benefits of these products  o public perceptions of the intrusiveness of these products and the manner in which firms are using the biometric information collected  o public perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information  and o marketing efforts and publicity regarding these products 
the use of biometric products for some applications has been objected to on civil liberties grounds 
legislation has been proposed to regulate the use of biometric security products partly in response to these objections 
if our marketing partners fail to promote our products  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue a significant portion of our revenues are expected to come from sales to marketing partners such as original equipment manufacturers  distributors  value added distributors and resellers 
some of these relationships are formalized in agreements  however  these agreements are often terminable with little or no notice or penalty and may be subject to periodic amendment 
the failure of our marketing partners to promote our products would severely limit our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that such marketing partners devote to their activities on our behalf and there is a risk that these parties may not actively promote our products 
we intend to continue to seek strategic relationships to distribute and sell some of our products 
however  we may be unable to negotiate acceptable distribution relationships in the future and cannot predict whether current or future distribution relationships will be successful 
we have never paid and do not expect to pay dividends we have not previously paid any dividends on our common stock and we intend to follow a policy of retaining all of our cash flow from operations  if any  to finance the development and expansion of our business
