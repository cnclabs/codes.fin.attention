item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company s results of operations over the three year period ended december  reflect its continued shift toward non ob gyn anatomic pathology testing 
the acquisitions of kyto meridien diagnostics  llc kmd in may and of pathology reference laboratory prl in february partially offset the impact of this shift during since these operations traditionally focused on ob gyn anatomic pathology  which has lower margins 
the reduced gross profit impact of these revenue factors was partially offset through cost savings in selling  general  administrative and other operating expenses 
results of operations o net revenues net revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  representing annual increases of and  respectively 
anatomic pathology net revenues increased to million in from million in and million in  increases of and  respectively 
the revenue growth reflects increased market penetration in the anatomic pathology area  including the impact of the kmd and prl acquisitions in may and february  respectively  offset by reimbursement reductions 
clinical chemistry net revenues increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily a result of the kmd acquisition 
clinical chemistry net revenues decreased million or from to this decrease reflected the company s shift in emphasis toward anatomic pathology  and is a result of both volume and reimbursement reductions including medicare reimbursement pressures 
o cost of sales cost of sales  which consists primarily of laboratory payroll and supplies  logistics and facility costs  increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales totaled  and in  and  respectively 
the increased percentages of revenue represented by cost of sales largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned reimbursement decreases and the integration of kmd and prl  which have lower margins than the traditional business 
o gross profit gross profit totaled million in versus million in and million in  while gross profit margins were  and  respectively 
the decreases in gross profit and margins reflect the factors discussed above under cost of sales 
the clinical laboratory industry  which includes both clinical chemistry and anatomic pathology  has seen steady and continuing downward pressure on prices exerted by both government and private third party payers 
payment for services such as those provided by the company is and will likely continue to be affected by periodic reevaluations made by payors concerning which services to reimburse or cease reimbursing 
over time  congress has reduced the national cap on medicare laboratory fee schedules under which the company s clinical chemistry services are reimbursed to of the national median 
in addition  legislation freezes fee schedule payments for the period 
with respect to the company s anatomic pathology services  which are not reimbursed under the medicare laboratory fee schedules  the medicare fees also generally declined with the implementation of the resource based relative value scale rbrvs system which went into effect in and was fully phased in by the end of in  there was an overall decrease of in payments for pathology services due to a five year review of the work value component and a decrease in the conversion factor applicable to pathology services  plus an additional decrease in connecticut  where the company s primary operations are located  because of the health care financing administration s hcfa reduction in the number of different payment localities recognized for rbrvs purposes 
beginning with the medicare physician fee schedule regulation that became effective on january   hcfa recalculated physician practice expenses  a key component of the rbrvs  to reflect resource consumption rather than historical charge data 
while the actual impact of this change on the company s medicare pathology revenues will depend on the mix of pathology services furnished  hcfa had estimated that the new system would decrease the medicare revenue for pathologists once it was fully phased in at the end of however  in the physician fee schedule regulation published on november   and effective january   hcfa increased the conversion factor approximately and made several changes in the payment methodology for physician services  including a modification specific to pathology that had a positive impact 
as a result of these changes  hcfa now estimates the impact of the practice expense recalculation will be only a decrease for pathology services 
in addition  other revisions to payment policies under the physician fee schedule for the year resulted in increases in the rbrvs fee schedule payment amounts for the most common pathology codes the company historically has performed 
hcfa also announced in the november  physician fee schedule final rule that  effective january   independent labs may no longer bill for the technical component tc of physician pathology services furnished to medicare beneficiaries who are hospital inpatients 
independent labs would still be permitted to bill and be paid for the tc of physician pathology services provided to beneficiaries who are hospital outpatients or are in other settings  but for the tc of services provided to inpatients  the independent laboratories will have to make arrangements with the hospital in order to receive payment 
the balanced budget act of bba contains measures to establish market oriented purchasing for medicare  including prospective payment systems pps for outpatient hospital services  home health care and nursing home care 
of these systems  only the skilled nursing facility snf pps has been implemented  and since the company does only minimal clinical laboratory testing for snf patients  this change is not expected to materially affect the company s business 
on september   hcfa published a proposed rule implementing the outpatient pps that would carve out clinical laboratory services from the outpatient hospital pps rates  but would include the technical component of surgical pathology services in the rate 
hcfa has said the final rule is expected to be published in the spring of  and will be effective july  the outpatient pps could affect the company s revenues for these surgical pathology services depending on the precise details of how the pps is implemented 
other potential changes in government and third party payer reimbursement  resulting from federal  state or local legislation  the impact of managed care  competitive bidding  or other market pressures  may continue to exert downward pressure on prices and make the market for clinical laboratory services more competitive  which could in turn have a material adverse impact on the company s gross profits 
o selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  after decreasing slightly from the million incurred in the increase of approximately million from to is primarily a result of increased commission expense  which is a result of increased revenues

o amortization of intangible assets amortization expense increased to  in from  in as a result of the kmd acquisition 
amortization expense remained flat between and at  and  respectively
