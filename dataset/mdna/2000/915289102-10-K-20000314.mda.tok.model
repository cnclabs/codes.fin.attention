amounts recorded for environment related expenses were approximately million in  million in and million in environmental expenses include provisions for remediation and operating  maintenance and administrative expenses that were identified during the company s ongoing review of its environmental obligations 
the higher expenses in were due primarily to provisions for remediation costs for the guadalupe  avila beach and mountain pass sites in california 
at december   the company s reserve for environmental remediation obligations totaled million  of which million was included in current liabilities 
the total amount is grouped into the following five categories 
year end millions of dollars superfund and similar sites former company operated sites company facilities sold with retained liabilities inactive or closed company facilities active company facilities total reserves superfund and similar sites at year end  unocal had received notification from the us environmental protection agency that the company may be a potentially responsible party prp at sites and may share certain liabilities at these sites 
in addition  various state agencies and private parties had identified other similar prp sites that may require investigation and remediation 
of the total  the company has denied responsibility at six sites and at another six sites the company s liability  although unquantified  appears to be de minimis 
the total also includes sites  which are under investigation or litigation  for which the company s potential liability is not presently determinable 
at another three sites  the company has made settlement payments and is in the final process of resolving its liabilities 
of the remaining sites  where probable costs can be estimated  reserves of million have been established for future remediation and settlement costs 
these sites exclude sites where the company s liability has been settled  or where the company has no evidence of liability and there has been no further indication of liability by government agencies or third parties for at least a month period 
unocal does not consider the number of sites for which it has been named a prp as a relevant measure of liability 
although the liability of a prp is generally joint and several  the company is usually just one of several companies designated as a prp 
the company s ultimate share of the remediation costs at those sites often is not determinable due to many unknown factors as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the solvency of other responsible parties and disputes regarding responsibilities may also impact the company s ultimate costs 
former company operated sites reserves of million have been established for this category of sites 
included are service stations sites  oil and gas fields and a refinery in heath  ohio  that were previously operated by the company 
company facilities sold with retained liabilities this category has reserves of million for environmental liabilities related to former company businesses that have been sold 
included are the company s former west coast refining  marketing and transportation assets sold to tosco corporation in march also included are auto truckstop facilities  a former mine site in wyoming  industrial chemical and polymer sites and agricultural chemical sites 
in each sale  the company retained a contractual remediation or indemnification obligation and is responsible only for certain environmental problems associated with its past operations 
the reserves represent presently estimated future costs for investigation feasibility studies and identified remediation work as a result of claims made by buyers of the properties 
inactive or closed company facilities reserves of million have been established for these types of facilities 
the major sites in this category are the guadalupe and avila beach sites and oil and gas properties in california s santa maria valley 
also included in this category is the former beaumont refinery in texas and a tank farm site in san luis obispo  california 
active company facilities the company has provided million for estimated future costs of remedial orders  corrective actions and other investigation  remediation and monitoring obligations at certain operating facilities and producing oil and gas fields 
also included in this category are the questa molybdenum mine in new mexico and the mountain pass  california  lanthanide facility  both operated by the company s molycorp  inc molycorp subsidiary 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and laws governing low level radioactive materials 
under these laws  the company is subject to possible obligations to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of certain chemical and petroleum and radioactive substances at various sites 
corrective investigations and actions pursuant to rcra are being performed at the company s beaumont facility  the company s closed shale oil project and the company s washington  pennsylvania  molybdenum roasting facility 
in addition  the company is required to decommission its washington and york facilities in pennsylvania pursuant to the terms of their respective radioactive source materials licenses and decommissioning plans 
the company also must provide financial assurance for future closure and post closure costs of its rcra permitted facilities and for decommissioning costs at facilities that are under radioactive source materials licenses 
because these costs will be incurred at different times and over a period of many years  the company believes that these obligations are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the total environmental remediation reserves recorded on the consolidated balance sheet represent the company s estimates of assessment and remediation costs based on currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
the remediation cost estimates  in many cases  are based on plans recommended to the regulatory agencies for approval and are subject to future revisions 
the ultimate costs to be incurred will likely exceed the total amounts reserved  since many of the sites are relatively early in the remedial investigation or feasibility study phases 
additional liabilities may be accrued as the assessment work is completed and formal remedial plans are formulated 
the company has estimated  to the extent that it was able to do so  that it could incur approximately million of additional costs in excess of the million accrued at december  the amount of such possible additional costs reflects  in most cases  the high end of the range of costs of feasible alternatives identified by the company for those sites with respect to which investigation or feasibility studies have advanced to the stage of analyzing such alternatives 
however  such estimated possible additional costs are not an estimate of the total remediation costs beyond the amounts reserved  because at a large number of sites the company is not yet in a position to estimate all  or in some cases any possible additional costs 
both the amounts reserved and estimates of possible additional costs may change in the near term  in some cases  substantially  as additional information becomes available regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  required or agreed upon remediation methods  and other actions by government agencies and private parties

cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of unocal desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  as embodied in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and is including this statement in this report in order to do so 
this report contains forward looking statements and from time to time in the future the company s management or other persons acting on the company s behalf may make  in both written publications and oral presentations  additional forward looking statements to inform investors and other interested persons of the company s estimates and projections of  or increases or decreases in  amounts of future revenues  prices  costs  earnings  cash flows  capital expenditures  assets  liabilities and other financial items 
certain statements may also contain estimates and projections of future levels of  or increases or decreases in  crude oil and natural gas reserves and related finding and development costs  potential resources  production and related lifting costs  sales volumes and related prices  and other statistical items  plans and objectives of management regarding the company s future operations  projects  products and services  and certain assumptions underlying such estimates  projections  plans and objectives 
such forward looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as estimate  projection  plan  target  goal  forecast  believes  expects  anticipates or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
while such forward looking statements are made in good faith  forward looking statements and their underlying assumptions are by their nature subject to certain risks and uncertainties and their outcomes will be influenced by various operating  market  economic  competitive  credit  environmental  legal and political factors 
certain of such factors  set forth elsewhere in this report  are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
see the discussions of the risks to the completion of the proposed merger involving the company s exploration and production assets in the permian and san juan basins under strategic mergers and acquisitions on page  under outlook on p 
 and in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  the discussions of the risk to the completion of company s proposed sale of its agricultural products business under disposition of non strategic company assets on page  under consolidated results discontinued operations on page and in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  the discussions of the outstanding take or pay obligation for due from ptt under exploration and production international myanmar on page and under outlook on page  the discussion of risks in the last paragraph under exploration and production international on page  the discussion of the effort by the company s philippine geothermal  inc  subsidiary to settle a contract dispute under geothermal and power operations on page  the discussions under competition on page  government regulations on page and environmental regulations on pages and  the discussion of certain material lawsuits and claims  including tax matters  under item legal proceedings on pages through and in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages and  the discussion of reserves for and possible additional costs of remediation and other environment related expenditures and expenses under environmental matters on pages through and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements on pages and  the discussion of the outstanding accounts receivable related to the company s indonesian geothermal operations under outlook on page and under concentrations of credit risks in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  and the discussion of the risks associated with the company s use of derivative financial instruments in its hedging and trading activities under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on pages and and in note to the consolidated financial statements on pages through set forth below are additional important factors but not necessarily all of the additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
commodity prices a decline in the prices for crude oil  natural gas or other hydrocarbon commodities sold by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  on the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that could be economically produced from its fields  and on the quantities and economic values of its proved reserves and potential resources 
such adverse pricing scenarios could result in write downs of the carrying values of the company s properties  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  as well as its results of operations 
exploration and production risks the company s exploration and production activities are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally associated with such activities  including  but not limited to  such hazards as explosions  fires  blowouts  leaks and spills  some of which may be very difficult and expensive to control and or remediate  and damages from hurricanes  typhoons  monsoons and other severe weather conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and potential resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective geological  engineering and economic judgments 
changes in operating conditions  such as unforeseen geological complexities and drilling and production difficulties  and changes in economic conditions  such as finding and development and production costs and sales prices  could cause material downward revisions in the company s estimated proved reserves and potential resources 
projections of future amounts of crude oil and natural gas production are also imprecise because they rely on assumptions about the future levels of prices and costs  field decline rates  market demand and supply  the political  economic and regulatory climates and  in the case of the company s foreign production  the terms of the contracts under which the company operates  which could result in mandated production cutbacks from existing or projected levels 
the amounts of the company s future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production will also be affected by its ability to replace declining reservoirs in existing fields with new reserves through its exploration and development programs and through acquisitions 
the ability of the company to replace reserves will depend not only on its ability to obtain acreage and contracts in the countries in which it currently operates  as well as in new countries  and to delineate prospects which prove to be successful geologically  but also to drill  find  develop and produce recoverable quantities of oil and gas economically in the price environment prevailing at the time 
a significant portion of the company s expectation for future oil and gas development involves large projects  primarily offshore in increasingly deeper waters 
the timing and amounts of production from such projects will be dependent upon  among other things  the formulation of development plans and their approval by foreign governmental authorities and other working interest partners  the receipt of necessary permits and other approvals from governmental agencies  the obtaining of adequate financing  either internally or externally  the availability and costs of drilling rigs and other equipment  and the timely construction of platforms  pipelines and other necessary infrastructure by specialized contractors 
certain political and economic risks the company s operations outside of the us are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations  including  without limitation  the loss of revenues  property and equipment from hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties or other takes  abrogation or renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency conversion and repatriation restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
laws and policies of the us government affecting foreign trade and taxation may also adversely affect the company s international operations 
the company s ability to market crude oil  natural gas and other commodities produced in foreign countries  and the prices the company will be able to obtain for such production  will depend on many factors which are often beyond the company s control  such as the existence or development of markets for its discoveries  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities or the timely construction thereof  fluctuating demand for oil and natural gas  the availability and costs of competing fuels  and the effects of foreign governmental regulation of production and sales 
the company s operations in the us are also subject to political  regulatory and economic conditions 
in light of the foregoing  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect management s views only as of the date they are published or presented 
although the company from time to time may voluntarily revise its forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances  it undertakes no obligation to do so 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
as part of its overall risk management strategies  the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce risks associated with these factors 
the company also pursues outright pricing positions in hydrocarbon derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
company policies limit the amount of investment to any one financial institution 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate risk sensitive derivative financial instruments  such as swaps or options may also be used depending upon market conditions 
the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at year end assuming a ten percent decrease in the company s weighted average borrowing costs at year end  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments  including the company s net interests in the debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million at december  assuming a ten percent decrease in the company s weighted average borrowing costs at year end  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations and associated interest rate derivative instruments would have been approximately million at december  foreign exchange rate risk the company conducts business in various parts of the world and in various foreign currencies 
to limit the company s foreign currency exchange rate risk related to operating income  foreign sales agreements generally contain price provisions designed to insulate the company s sales revenues against adverse foreign currency exchange rates 
in most countries  energy products are valued and sold in us dollars and foreign currency operating cost exposures have not been significant 
in other countries  the company is paid for product deliveries in local currencies but at prices indexed to the us dollar 
these funds  less amounts retained for operating costs  are converted to us dollars as soon as practicable 
the company s canadian subsidiaries are paid in canadian dollars for their crude oil and natural gas sales 
excess canadian funds generally have been invested in other unocal foreign operations 
from time to time the company may purchase foreign currency options or enter into foreign currency swap or foreign currency forward contracts to limit the exposure related to its foreign currency debt or other obligations 
at year end  the company had various foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge some of its canadian cad dollar denominated debt and other local currency obligations in canada  thailand and the netherlands 
the company evaluated the effect that near term changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the fair value of the company s combined foreign currency position related to its outstanding foreign currency swaps and forward exchange contracts 
assuming an adverse change of ten percent in foreign exchange rates at year end  the potential decrease in fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts  including the company s net interests in the foreign currency denominated debt  foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts of its subsidiaries  would have been approximately million at december  at year end  the company had various foreign currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts outstanding to hedge its cad denominated debt and other local currency obligations in canada and thailand 
assuming an adverse change of ten percent in foreign exchange rates at year end  the potential decrease in fair value of the company s foreign currency position related to its foreign currency denominated debt  foreign currency swap agreements and foreign currency forward contacts at december  would have been approximately million 
commodity price risk the company is a producer  purchaser  marketer and trader of certain hydrocarbon commodities such as crude oil and condensate  natural gas and petroleum based products and is subject to the associated price risks 
the company uses hydrocarbon derivative financial instruments derivatives  such as futures contracts  swaps and options to mitigate its overall exposure to fluctuations in hydrocarbon commodity prices 
the company may also enter into swaps  options  or other contracts to hedge contractual delivery commitments and future crude oil and natural gas production against price exposure 
the company also actively trades derivatives  primarily exchange regulated futures and options contracts  subject to internal policy limitations 
the company uses a variance covariance value at risk model to assess the market risk of its hydrocarbon price sensitive price sensitive derivatives 
value at risk represents the potential loss in fair value the company would experience on its price sensitive derivatives  using calculated volatilities and correlations over a specified time period with a given confidence level 
the company s risk model is based upon historical data and uses a three day time interval with a percent confidence level 
the model includes offsetting physical positions for price sensitive derivatives related to the company s prepaid crude oil and prepaid natural gas sales  as well the company s net interests in its subsidiaries crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments and forward sales contracts 
based upon the company s risk model  the value at risk related to price sensitive derivative financial instruments held for purposes other than trading was approximately million at december  the value at risk related to price sensitive derivatives held for trading purposes was approximately million at december  in  the company changed from a one week time interval to a three day time interval 
consequently  value at risk amounts have been restated using the three day time interval 
the value at risk related to price sensitive derivatives held for purposes other than trading was approximately million at december  the value at risk related to price sensitive derivatives held for trading purposes was approximately million at december  this page intentionally left blank
