item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s business and the homebuilding industry in general are subject to changes in economic conditions  including but not limited to employment levels  interest rates  the availability of credit  and consumer confidence 
the company s success in and during the past several years has been influenced by favorable economic conditions in its principal markets 
employment has been strong  interest rates have been relatively low  low inflation has kept the company s costs predictable 
financing has been readily available to crossmann s consumers in the form of fha and va mortgages 
capital has been readily available for expansion  enabling crossmann to take advantage of a strong economic climate 
there can be no assurance that these trends will continue 
in fact  rising interest rates during the latter part of affected orders compared to backlog at december  is lower than at december  although management believes that home ownership is still attractive for many buyers at prevailing interest rates  there can be no assurance the company will match its recent growth rate 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to find attractive opportunities in new cities  nor can there be any assurance that the company will be able to transfer its business strategy to new market areas successfully  or that new markets will offer the opportunities and stability of the company s existing markets 
results of operations during the five year period ended december   the company s sales increased at an average compound annual rate of per year  from million in to million in net income increased at an average compound annual rate of  from million in to million in shareholders equity increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the following table recaps unit growth in the company s markets

these factors caused consumers to add optional items to their homes 
the rise in selling price was also attributable to crossmann s acquisition of homes by huff co 
in june of the new acquisition contributed closings at an average selling price of approximately  which is higher than crossmann s other markets 
gross profit increased by million  or approximately  for the year 
this represents a gross margin percentage of of sales in as compared to in the decrease in margin percentage resulted in part from market mix crossmann achieves generally higher margins in cities where it has operated longer and has greater buying power in the local building market 
stronger closings in newer markets generally yielded lower margins than in more established markets 
the decrease in gross margin percentage can also be attributed to financing assistance paid by crossmann 
as rates trended higher in  the company contributed points and closing costs toward its consumers financing cost  to help keep consumers qualified for mortgage financing 
this practice helps the company retain backlog in periods of rising rates  however  it adds to cost of those sales 
management believes that the lower gross margin in compared to helped crossmann to achieve significantly higher overall volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in higher volume in the newer divisions helped to offset overhead

margins were also stronger in ft 
wayne  southern indiana  cincinnati and dayton in than in improving margins in maturing markets tend to offset weaker margins that new divisions may generate in early stages 
in addition  interest rates in were low 
seller contributions toward closing costs and points were minimal 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in the increase reflected higher general and administrative expenses incurred by the newer homebuilding divisions 
higher volume in these divisions anticipated in was expected to offset this overhead in later periods 
other income  net of expenses increased million for the year  to approximately million in from million in the increase was due principally to earnings from trinity  which generated approximately million in income to crossmann in compared to approximately  in due to the increase in unit sales and to increased other income  income before income taxes for increased approximately million over  or

liquidity and capital resources at december   crossmann had cash and cash equivalents balances of million  of which million was held in escrow for periods of up to days 
on october   crossmann s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of its outstanding shares  shares out of  shares then outstanding 
as of december    shares had been repurchased pursuant to this plan  at an average price of per share 
the company repurchased  additional shares subsequent to december  at an average price of per share 
during  expenditures were financed with cash from operations and with borrowings on a million unsecured line of credit with bank one  indiana na and its participants 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  but permits portions of the outstanding balance to be committed for fixed periods of time at a rate equal to libor plus through 
at december  the company had drawn funds on its senior bank line of credit of  this line of credit has a three year maturity  renewable annually 
the company also has million in senior notes  maturing in with interest payable quarterly at  and annual principal reductions of  and million in senior notes issued in june of  payable over years at  payable quarterly 
annual principal reductions for this note issue of  begin june  both the note agreements and the bank line of credit require compliance with certain financial and operating covenants and place certain limitations on the company s investments in land and unconsolidated joint ventures 
they also restrict payments of cash dividends by the company 
the company s primary uses of capital are home construction costs and the purchase and development of land 
real estate inventories were approximately million or of total assets at december  compared to approximately million or of total assets at december  to assure the future availability of developed lots for next year s operations  from time to time in the normal course of business the company contracts to purchase a portion of its developed lots from outside developers 
total commitments for these purchases was approximately million at december  the purchases of these lots are subject to various conditions imposed on both the sellers and the company 
capital is also used to add and improve equipment used in administering the business and for model home furnishings 
in  the company acquired homes by huff co  inc  a raleigh  north carolina homebuilder 
this transaction gave rise to approximately million in goodwill in from time to time  crossmann enters into joint ventures with other builders and developers  to share risk and to obtain external expertise 
crossmann s investment in and advances to joint ventures increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the most significant joint venture investment is trinity homes llc  with investments in and advances to totaling approximately million 
the notes and the banks credit agreement are expected to provide adequate liquidity for planned internal growth and capital expenditures 
in the event that the company seeks to accelerate growth through the acquisition of large parcels of land or of other homebuilders  additional capital may be necessary 
the company believes that such capital could be obtained from banks or other financing alternatives  from the issuance of additional shares  or from seller financing  however  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to secure the necessary capital 
inflation and effects of changing prices the company historically has been able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases and accordingly has not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
because the company sells to a price conscious consumer  its ability to raise prices is limited 
however  in  the company was able to pass along certain price increases effectively 
the average selling price increased from approximately  in to approximately  in generally  management seeks to optimize volume by keeping homes affordable and to optimize margins thorough careful planning 
housing demand  in general  is affected adversely by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  the company s sales of residential real estate could be adversely affected 
in addition  gross profit and net income can be affected because crossmann can assist buyers  subject to certain limitations by fha and va  by paying a portion of a customer s points and closing costs needed to help in securing a mortgage loan 
future trends management views land acquisition and zoning as the greatest challenges to its business in years to come 
the company will continue to seek to maximize the value of each parcel it purchases so that it can continue to serve its core customer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not invest in marketable securities  nor does it engage in hedging activities or foreign currency conversions 
a portion of its revolving debt is carried at floating interest rates  but the exposure to changes in prime rate related to that debt is not material
