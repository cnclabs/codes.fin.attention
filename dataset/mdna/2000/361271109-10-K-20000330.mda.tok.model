however  the company is actively searching for acquisitions that will be accretive to the company s stockholders

the company considers its ability to generate cash to be good and expects to continue meeting all operating requirements as well as providing sufficient funds to maintain stockholder distributions in accordance with reit requirements 
long term liquidity requirements such as refinancing mortgages  financing acquisitions and financing capital improvements will be accomplished through long term borrowings  the sale of assets and the issuance of debt securities 
distributions the company declared a quarterly distribution payable to holders of the company s common stock for the first and second quarter of in the amount of per common share  which was paid on april and july  to stockholders of record on march and june  respectively 
for the third and fourth quarters of  the company declared a distribution payable to holders of the company s common stock in the amount of per common share  which was paid on october  and january  to stockholders of record on september and december  respectively 
the board of directors of the company reduced the company s common stock distribution in the third quarter of in order to preserve more of the company s cash flow for acquisition and development activities 
in prior years  the company has maintained a relatively constant quarterly dividend 
however  this has resulted in a return of capital to stockholders because the company s earnings have not kept pace with such distributions 
in order to maximize its cash flow in the future  the company expects to pay a common stock dividend in the amount that approximates the minimum dividend required to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust 
this may result in fluctuations in total dividends from year to year or even quarter to quarter depending upon variations in the company s taxable income resulting from such factors as sales of properties or adjustments to reserves 
the company also paid monthly dividends to holders of the company s series a and series b preferred stock on the fifteenth day of each month

however  excluding the million non cash impairment loss and the million increase in bad debt reserves  the company s ffo for was million 
the company believes that the reduced common stock dividend rate will benefit stockholders in the future by allowing the company to preserve its cash flow to invest in new acquisition and development projects 
however  the company can offer no assurances that the reduced common stock dividend will allow the company to consistently produce a level of ffo at least equal to the current level of distributions in the future 
the dividends paid to the company s preferred stockholders remain unchanged 
financing policies the company s ratio of debt to total market capitalization was based upon the closing price of the common stock at december  total market capitalization is based on the long term debt of the operating partnership  plus i the aggregate market value of the company s common stock and operating partnership units not owned by the company assuming one unit is equivalent in value to one share of common stock  and ii the aggregate liquidation value of the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock 
to the extent that the board of directors of the company decides to seek additional funding  the company may raise such capital using various means  including retention of internally generated funds subject to the distribution requirements in the code with respect to reits  existing working capital and possibly the issuance of additional debt secured or unsecured or any combination of the above 
it is anticipated that borrowings will continue to be made through the operating partnership or other entities  although the company may also incur indebtedness that may be re borrowed by the operating partnership on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the company s borrowing of such funds 
except as required pursuant to existing financing agreements  the company has not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages or unsecured debt that may be placed on any single property or on its portfolio as a whole 
the board of directors of the company also has the authority to cause the operating partnership to issue additional units in any manner and subject to certain limitations in the partnership agreement on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate and may also decide to seek financing for the purposes of managing the company s balance sheet by adjusting the company s existing capitalization 
the refinancing of the company s balance sheet may entail the issuance and or retirement of debt  equity or hybrid securities 
inflation the majority of the company s leases are long term leases designed to mitigate the adverse effect of inflation 
approximately of the company s leases contain provisions that call for annual rent increases equal to the increase in the consumer price index and the majority of the remaining leases allow for specific annual rent increases 
furthermore  many of the company s leases require tenants to pay a pro rata share of building operating expenses  including real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance 
the effect of such provisions is to reduce the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

year compliance the information provided below contains year statements and is a year readiness disclosure pursuant to pub 
l 
no 
many computers  software programs and other equipment which utilize microprocessors collectively referred to as systems and individually as a system process date sensitive data in the normal course of operations 
some of these systems use a digit field to designate the year 
as the year approached  there was concern these systems might not be capable of distinguishing between events occurring in the year and the year  and that these systems might become inoperable or produce information that was unreliable 
the company experienced no adverse affects related to the year problem 
none of the company s systems nor any of its vendors or tenants systems have adversely affected the company 
the company believes that it is not at risk for any year related problems  but will continue to monitor all systems that could  but have not  been affected 
the cost to the company to make its internal systems year compliant was not material to the company s financial position 
funds from operations industry analysts generally consider ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of a reit 
the company s financial statements use the concept of ffo as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo is calculated to include the minority interests share of income since the operating partnership s net income is allocated proportionately among all owners of operating partnership units 
the number of operating partnership units held by the company is identical to the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock  and owners of operating partnership units may  at their discretion  convert their units into shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
the company believes that  in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the company s net income as presented in the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k and the additional data presented below 
the table on the following page presents an analysis of ffo and additional data for each of the four quarters and the year ended december  for the operating partnership g l realty corp

ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by nareit 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator developed in compliance with gaap  including measures of liquidity such as cash flows from operations  investing and financing activities 
ffo is helpful in evaluating the performance of a real estate portfolio considering the fact that historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
ffo is only one of a range of indicators which should be considered in determining a company s operating performance 
the methods of calculating ffo among different companies are subject to variation  and ffo therefore may be an invalid measure for purposes of comparing companies 
also  the elimination of depreciation and gains and losses on sales of property may not be a true indication of an entity s ability to recover its investment in properties 
the company implemented the new method of calculating ffo effective as of the nareit suggested adoption date of january  ffo has been restated for all prior periods under the new method
