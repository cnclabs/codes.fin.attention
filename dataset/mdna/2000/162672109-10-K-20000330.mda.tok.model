item legal proceedings 
on june   a former employee filed an action against cheap tickets and two of its corporate officers in the superior court in los angeles  california alleging  among other causes of action  that he was fraudulently induced to become and stay as an employee  that he was improperly excluded from participating in management incentive plans  that he was improperly cut back on the allocation of shares in cheap tickets initial public offering  and that cheap tickets was unjustly enriched by his management of its cruise division 
the initial complaint has been amended twice so that the second amended complaint now seeks damages of  for the difference the employee received for the sale of a separate business and what this separate business would have been worth had he continued it   for the difference between the compensation the employee received from cheap tickets and what he would have received if he accepted a competing position with another company   for improperly excluding the employee from participating in management incentive plans   for the amount the employee enhanced the value of the cheap tickets public offering   for the estimated profit from the cruise division during the employee s tenure  and unspecified punitive damages 
the defense and indemnification on the complaint has been tendered to cheap tickets insurance carrier 
cheap tickets insurance carrier has appointed counsel to provide a defense for cheap tickets and its two corporate officers 
management believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously contest this lawsuit 
the lawsuit is in an early stage of litigation  and it is too early to determine what  if any  liability cheap tickets will have with respect to the claims made in this lawsuit 
at this time  the depositions of the former employee and one of the corporate officers have been completed 
the insurance defense counsel prepared a motion to strike various claims of the second amended complaint 
the court struck all claims except the claim for excluding the employee from participating in management incentive plans and unspecified punitive damages 
the defense of such litigation could entail considerable cost and the diversion of efforts of management  either of which could hurt cheap tickets results of operations

any such proceeding against cheap tickets  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

as a result  cheap tickets typically has higher sales and gross profit in the second and third quarters and lower sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter 
during periods of high volume air travel  such as occur in the fourth quarter of each year  cheap tickets historically has had access to fewer non published fares  and such fares on certain major routes may be blacked out or otherwise unavailable 
online gross bookings may also tend to be seasonal and may decline or grow less rapidly in the summer months 
the seasonal sales cycle is fairly predictable  but the cycle may shift year to year  corresponding to changes in the economy or other factors affecting the market such as price wars 
this could lead to unusual volatility in revenues and earnings

the implementation of these pronouncements did not have a material effect on cheap tickets financial statements 
year compliance cheap tickets has taken steps to address potential year problems 
cheap tickets has formed a project team from its systems and technology  finance  telecom and operations departments 
the project team was responsible for implementing the following four phase process identifying the computer systems and products affected  contacting vendors and suppliers  determining the year compliance status of each system and product  and implementing any necessary changes 
although to date the impact of year issues has not been material to its systems  cheap tickets could experience residual year issues that could have a material and adverse effect on cheap tickets business  results of operations or financial condition if not properly addressed 
cheap tickets currently has three types of computer systems or programs which may be affected by residual year issues 
they include reservations database systems  pc lan systems and non informational technology systems 
the reservations database systems involve the computer programs and products responsible for airline  cruise  car and hotel reservations and other transactional systems 
pc lan systems include cheap tickets personal computer network systems 
non informational technology systems include systems or hardware containing embedded technology such as micro controllers 
reservation database systems 
the main supplier of the cheap tickets reservation database systems is sabre 
currently  over of cheap tickets computing transactions are processed through the sabre systems 
this includes transactions involving airline reservations  booking  ticketing  car and hotel rentals  cruises and accounting 
sabre has advised cheap tickets that it has a year implementation plan in place 
further  sabre has advised cheap tickets that it has resolved year issues for its main computer system the airlines reservations system 
in turn  cheap tickets has implemented all changes required by sabre for cheap tickets to be year compliant 
there can be no assurances that sabre will be compliant with residual year issues and that the impact of sabre s non compliance  if any  would not be material 
pc lan systems 
cheap tickets has completed the replacement of all of its pc lan computing systems 
all the new pc lan systems being installed  including hardware  software  applications and operating systems  have been represented by their vendors to be year compliant 
cheap tickets believes that any systems that it has not yet replaced do not present any year concerns because  to cheap tickets knowledge  these systems already are year compliant 
in addition  cheap tickets is currently requiring that any new systems it purchases meet year compliance requirements 
there can be no assurances that such pc lan computing systems will be compliant with residual year issues and that the impact of such non compliance  if any  would not be material 
non informational technology systems 
cheap tickets has evaluated its non informational technology systems 
each of its operational centers has achieved year compliance for these systems 
cheap tickets has not developed a contingency plan in the event that any of its critical computer systems are not compliant with residual year issues 
management believes that the expenses for ensuring year compliance of its computer products and systems has not had a material adverse effect on operations or earnings  and can be financed out of cash flow from operations 
despite cheap tickets assessment of current hardware and software  the assessment of cheap tickets current state of compliance may not be fully accurate  and cheap tickets plans for achieving full compliance with residual year issues may not in fact be fully successful 
cheap tickets is also in the process of attempting to verify that all of the products supplied by third party vendors have either resolved the year issue or have a published plan to do so 
in certain cases  such as with sabre  cheap tickets has relied in good faith on representations and warranties regarding year compliance provided to it by third party vendors of hardware and software  and on consultants 
such representations and warranties may not be accurate in all material respects and the advice or assessments of consultants may not be reliable 
if third parties are not able to make their systems year compliant in a timely manner  it could have a material and adverse effect on cheap tickets business  results of operations and financial condition 
cheap tickets has not developed a contingency plan to address the possibility that sabre is unable to achieve compliance with residual year issues and does not intend to do so 
federal aviation administration readiness 
on july   the faa announced that all of its computer systems were fully year compliant 
according to the faa s announcement  compliance had been verified by an independent contractor 
the faa s state of year readiness could have a significant impact on air travel for an uncertain period of time after january  air travel may be affected both by travelers safety fears and by actual disruption caused by residual year issues 
possible air traffic disruption 
a breakdown of the air control system  or other breakdowns generally resulting in reduced air traffic or less safe air travel  could have more serious impact on the air travel business generally and could affect cheap tickets business  results of operations and financial condition more adversely 
management has not drawn any conclusions about whether any such residual year effect will be experienced and  if so  how it will affect cheap tickets 
in addition  cheap tickets has not developed a contingency plan to address this situation and does not intend to do so 
effect on other entities 
finally  year issues may impact other entities with which cheap tickets does business  including  for example  airlines and those responsible for maintaining telephone and internet communications 
accordingly  cheap tickets cannot predict the effect of year problems on such entities 
if these other entities fail to take preventive or corrective actions in a timely manner  year issues could have a material and adverse effect on cheap tickets business  results of operations and financial condition 
cheap tickets has not yet developed a contingency plan to address the possibility that other entities with which it does business are unable to achieve compliance with year issues and does not intend to do so 
additional factors that could affect operating results in addition to the other information we provide in this annual report on form k  you should carefully consider the following risks that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by forward looking statements contained herein 
these are not the only risks we face 
some risks are not yet known to us and there are others we do not currently believe are material but could later turn out to be so 
all of these could hurt our business 
for access to non published fares  we depend on travel suppliers with which we have no long term or exclusive contracts 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross bookings came from the sale of airline tickets 
non published fares represented about of our airline gross bookings and of our net revenues  and we believe that our continuing ability to obtain non published fares is key to our success 
our business could be hurt by 
refusals by airlines to renew contracts for supply of non published fares  
lack of available excess capacity for an extended time period  
renewals of the contracts on less favorable terms  or 
cancellation of contracts 
non published fares are tickets we acquire from the airlines and resell to consumers at substantial discounts off published fares 
the airlines sell us tickets at these non published fares primarily to dispose of excess capacity without eroding published fare structures 
we have contracts with more than airlines that permit us to acquire non published fares on routes designated in the contracts at specified prices 
these contracts do not require airlines to provide a specific quantity of tickets or to deal with us exclusively 
although the terms vary  the typical contract is for a period from one to one and a half years  and many are cancelable on days notice or less 
we have a consistent record of renewing these contracts  but airlines may decide not to do business with us or to dispose of excess capacity themselves or through others 
at times in the past  airlines have renewed contracts with us on less favorable terms and this may continue to occur in the future 
in addition  there may be times when they have less excess capacity to sell 
a large percentage of our sales of non published fares currently comes from a limited number of suppliers 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales of non published fares came from tickets we bought from three airlines continental represented approximately  twa represented approximately  and america west represented approximately 
in  these same three airlines represented of our sales of non published fares 
if one or more of these carriers were to discontinue to supply non published fares to us  our business could be hurt 
the percentages of non published fare sales represented by our leading carriers are likely to change from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including the availability of excess capacity from each carrier and the breadth of routes on which non published fares are available 
we typically engage in ongoing discussions with existing carriers about increasing the routes available for sale of non published fares 
from time to time  we also discuss potential new relationships for the supply of non published fares with carriers with whom we currently do not have contracts 
our travel suppliers may be acquired and then not continue to deal with us 
we believe that our continued ability to obtain non published fares is key to our success 
because many of our contracts are short term and can be cancelled on short notice  we depend on our relationships with our suppliers for a continued supply of non published fares 
we also depend on continuation of our suppliers policy of selling excess capacity through non published fares 
the acquisition of one of our suppliers could hurt our relationship with that supplier and or could change that supplier s policy of dealing with excess capacity 
in  reno air was acquired by american airlines 
for the year ended december   reno air accounted for approximately of our sales of non published fares 
american airlines has made most of the former reno air routes available to us for the sale of non published fares 
a decline in airline commission rates or the elimination of commissions could hurt our business 
we earned approximately of our gross profit for the year ended december  from commissions  including incentive overrides  paid by airlines 
however  the airlines are not required to pay any particular commission rates or any commissions at all 
if air carriers reduce  restrict or eliminate altogether commissions or impose surcharges for tickets not sold by them at any time  it could hurt our business 
in recent years  airlines have reduced rates and capped per ticket commissions 
in addition  they have further reduced rates and capped commissions for online reservations 
potential fluctuations in our financial results makes financial forecasting difficult 
our annual or quarterly results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could result in a decline in the value of our common stock 
our business is seasonal due to customers leisure travel patterns and changes in the availability of non published fares 
we typically have higher sales and gross profit in the second and third quarters and lower sales and gross profit in the fourth quarter  and historically we have experienced losses in net income in the fourth quarter 
during periods of high volume air travel  such as occur in the fourth quarter of each year  we historically have had access to fewer non published fares  and such fares on certain major routes may be unavailable 
online gross bookings may also tend to be seasonal and may decline or grow less rapidly in the summer months 
the seasonal sales cycle is fairly predictable  but the cycle may shift year to year  corresponding to changes in the economy or other factors affecting the market such as price wars which recently occurred in the fourth quarter of this could lead to unusual volatility in revenues and earnings 
gross profit may be impacted by a number of different factors  including 
the number of fares sold  
the percentage of gross bookings represented by non published fare sales  
the gross margin percentages on non published fare sales 
these percentages in turn can be impacted by the sales mix of airlines  whose net fare prices to us vary  and by competitive factors on various routes and the possible elimination of profitable routes  
rates of commissions on published fare sales  and 
the amount of volume bonuses 
any change in these factors could materially affect our gross margins and operating results in future periods 
other events outside our control  including those set forth in other risk factors  may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and earnings 
we intend to increase operating expenses in anticipation of future sales 
if these increased sales do not occur or occur only in subsequent periods  we may experience downward fluctuations in our earnings 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
a decline in leisure travel or disruptions in travel generally could hurt our business 
we earn almost all our revenues from the travel industry  particularly from leisure travel 
leisure travel is highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels and thus tends to decline during general economic downturns 
in addition  other adverse trends or events that tend to reduce leisure travel are likely to hurt our business 
these may include 
political instability  
regional hostilities  
terrorism  
fuel price escalation  
travel related accidents  
bad weather  or 
airline or other travel related strikes 
a number of airlines are currently in various stages of negotiation with unions representing their employees 
if those negotiations fail and the unions select to strike or effect a slowdown  our business could be harmed 
we face actual and potential competition from many sources 
we compete in ticket sales against travel wholesalers  consolidators  online travel companies  airlines and travel agents based on price and the quality of service to the customer 
in the leisure travel market  we also compete against frequent flyer awards and charter flights 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  loss of market share and decreased brand recognition 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
among other factors  our success depends heavily on our access to non published fares  on our brand recognition and on the ability of our systems to integrate our non published fares with published fares to offer customers a broad choice 
some of our competitors  including the air carriers themselves  have longer histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to replicate the factors that make us successful 
they may also enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  established and well financed companies 
some of our competitors have agreements to buy non published fares from our major suppliers 
for example  priceline 
com  inc signed an agreement to purchase non published tickets from continental  united  american airlines and others  and has granted warrants to purchase priceline 
com common stock to certain carriers 
our competitors may be able to induce one or more of our suppliers of non published fares  through pricing  equity or other incentives  to cease doing business with us  or to do business with us on less favorable terms 
they might also be able to build strong brand recognition in the leisure travel market  through widespread advertising and other marketing efforts 
certain of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns on the internet 
competitors may also devote substantially more resources to website and systems development than we do 
any or all of these developments could bring heavy competitive pressures to bear on us 
we also face the prospect of competition from potential competitors not yet in the leisure travel market 
we believe that potential competitors are likely to be large  well financed companies with existing brand name recognition and proven retail distribution ability 
for a more complete description of the competitive environment in which we operate  please refer to item business competition 
the success of our business will depend on continued growth of online commerce and internet infrastructure 
our future revenues and profits depend  to a certain degree  upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet and online services as a medium for commerce by customers and sellers 
if acceptance and growth of internet use does not continue  it will hurt our business 
rapid growth in the use of the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
this growth may not continue 
a sufficiently broad base of customers may not accept  or continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
demand for and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
there are few proven products and services 
for us to achieve significant growth  customers who have historically used traditional means of commerce will instead need to elect to purchase products and services online  and sellers of products and services will need to accept or expand use of the internet as a channel of distribution 
our revenues and profits depend on customers visiting our website and actually purchasing tickets 
customers could potentially use the site for route information and choose to purchase tickets directly from the airlines or elsewhere 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
this will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and the timely development of complementary products  such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
major online service providers and the internet itself have experienced outages and other delays as a result of software and hardware failures and could face such outages and delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on the cheap tickets website 
it is unlikely that we could make up for the level of orders lost in those circumstances by increased phone orders 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability by reason of delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity or of increased government regulation 
the adoption of new standards or government regulation may require us to incur substantial compliance costs 
our brand may not achieve the broad recognition necessary to succeed 
we believe that we must maintain and enhance the cheap tickets brand to continue to attract and expand business 
failure to maintain and enhance our brand could hurt our business 
the success of the cheap tickets brand will depend to a certain extent on our ability to enhance our advertising programs 
the number of internet sites that offer competing services increases the importance of establishing and maintaining our brand name recognition 
many online sites already have well established brands in online services or the travel industry generally 
we intend to expand significantly our advertising expense  including national television and radio promotions  but these expenditures may not result in increased business activity or the desired enhancement of brand recognition 
this could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be unable to manage our rapid growth effectively 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and anticipate further significant expansion 
our inability to manage growth effectively could hurt our business 
we have recently added a number of key managerial and technical employees  and we expect to add additional key personnel in the future 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel  we plan to 
improve and upgrade transaction processing  operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls  
maintain and expand our relationships with various travel service suppliers  internet portals and other travel related website companies and other third parties necessary to our business  
expand our finance  administrative and operations staff  
continue to attract  train and manage our employee base  and 
implement a disaster recovery program 
our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our planned growth  and our management may not be able to identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities successfully 
we may not be able to keep up with the industry s rapid technological and other changes 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by 
rapid technological change  
changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  
frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  
the emergence of new industry standards and practices  and 
the emerging importance of the internet and the proliferation of companies offering internet based products and services 
these developments could render our existing online sites and proprietary technology and systems quickly obsolete 
our inability to modify or adapt our infrastructure in a timely manner or the expenses incurred in making such adaptations could hurt our business 
as a result  we will be required to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing services and develop new services in a cost effective and timely manner 
the development of proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we may not be able to adapt successfully to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
in addition  the widespread adoption of internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technologies could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
our computer and communications systems are vulnerable to business interruptions 
our ability to receive and fill orders through our call centers or online and provide high quality customer service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems 
the occurrence of interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to accept and confirm customer reservations could hurt our business 
our online servers are located in sunnyvale  california and herndon  virginia  the sabre group s computers are located in tulsa  oklahoma  our communication systems are located at four call centers  and our accounting systems computers are located in hawaii 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  natural disasters and similar events 
recently  the operations of several major online companies were disrupted by data floods from hackers  and we may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage 
we currently do not carry adequate business interruption insurance 
although we have adopted network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these kinds of events could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to accept and confirm customer reservations 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could hurt our business 
interruptions in service from third parties could hurt our business 
we rely on certain third party computer systems and third party service providers  including the computerized central reservation systems of the airline and hotel industries to make airline ticket and hotel room reservations 
any interruption in these third party services or a deterioration in their performance could hurt our business 
if our arrangement with any of these third parties is terminated  we may not find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms 
we rely on third parties to print our airline tickets and arrange for their delivery 
we rely on third parties to host our online system s infrastructure  web and database servers 
we currently rely on sabre for our general reservations system  including customer profiling  making reservations and credit card verification and confirmations 
currently  over of our computing transactions are processed through the sabre systems 
our technology relationship with sabre for internet operations will further increase our dependency 
if we or sabre ever elect to terminate the existing relationship  we would be forced to convert to another provider 
this conversion could require a substantial commitment of time and resources and hurt our business 
our current reservation systems may not be able to handle all calls adequately 
our call centers have not been able to answer all calls or service all inquiries adequately 
our systems lack of capacity to handle the demands of our customers can cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  poor customer service  impaired quality and speed of reservations and confirmations and delays in reporting accurate financial information 
these problems could hurt our business 
if we experience a substantial increase in our web traffic or in reservations beyond expected levels  we may need to expand and upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure beyond planned levels of improvement 
if we fail to expand and upgrade in a timely manner  our business could be hurt 
in addition  we may not be able to 
project accurately the rate or timing of increases in demand  
upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate future traffic levels  
integrate successfully any newly developed or purchased technology with our existing systems  or 
upgrade and expand our systems in a timely or efficient manner 
online security breaches could hurt our business 
in our business  secured transmission of confidential information over public networks is essential to maintain consumer and supplier confidence 
if any compromise of our security were to occur  it could hurt our business 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the potential compromise of customer privacy may inhibit the growth of commercial online services as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
we have expended significant resources to protect against security breaches and to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  and we may need to make further expenditures for this purpose in the future 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to transmit securely confidential information  such as customer credit card numbers 
in addition  we maintain an extensive confidential database of customer profiles and transaction information 
our current security measures may not be adequate and advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the methods we use to protect customer transaction and personal data 
a party who can circumvent our security might be able to misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
security breaches could also expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential customer information 
if we lose our key personnel or cannot recruit additional personnel  our business may suffer 
we depend substantially on the continued services and performance of our senior management  particularly michael j 
hartley  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  sam galeotos  president and chief operating officer  and certain other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these executive officers or other key employees could hurt our business 
we have employment agreements with only certain of our key personnel 
in addition  most members of our senior management group have been recruited and hired over the past months 
these individuals may not be able to fulfill their responsibilities adequately and may not remain with us 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
the location of our headquarters in hawaii may also make it more difficult to attract qualified personnel from the mainland 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in particular  we may encounter difficulties in attracting a sufficient number of qualified software developers for our online services and transaction processing systems 
the failure to retain and attract necessary technical  managerial  marketing and customer service personnel could hurt our business and impair our growth strategy 
although none of our employees is represented by a labor union  our employees may join or form a labor union 
our business could be hurt if we do not offer new services successfully 
we plan to introduce new and expanded services 
our inability to generate revenues from such expanded services or products sufficient to offset their development or offering cost could hurt our business 
our alternative products  including cruises  auto rentals and hotel room reservations  represented less than of our gross bookings for the year ended december  our business strategy is to increase the percentage of such alternate travel offerings as a percentage of our revenues 
we may not be able to offer such services in a cost effective or timely manner and our efforts may not be successful 
further  any new service that is not favorably received by customers could damage our reputation or brand name 
expansion of our services could also require significant additional expenses and may strain our management  financial and operational resources 
if we cannot obtain alternate travel offerings in the future  we may not be able to benefit fully from our growth strategy 
our business could be hurt if we make acquisitions that are not successful 
we may in the future broaden the scope and content of our business through the acquisition of existing complementary businesses 
we may not be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions  and our inability to do so could hurt our business 
we may consider the acquisition of companies providing similar services in international markets or in other sectors of the travel industry in the future 
future acquisitions would expose us to increased risks 
these include risks associated with 
the assimilation of new operations  sites and personnel  
the diversion of resources from our existing businesses  sites and technologies  
the inability to generate revenues from new sites or content sufficient to offset associated acquisition costs  
the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and 
the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses 
acquisitions may also result in additional expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets or potential businesses 
our business could be hurt if our international expansion is not successful 
one component of our growth strategy is to expand internationally 
international expansions will present us with special problems of adapting to foreign business customs and regulations and of managing staff effectively from a distance 
if we do not address these problems adequately  our international expansion may not produce desired results 
this could hurt our business 
we may expend significant financial and management resources to establish local offices overseas  create localized user interfaces and comply with local customs and regulations 
if the revenues generated by these international operations are insufficient to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining them  our business could be hurt 
to date  we have no experience in developing localized versions of our online sites or offshore call centers and only limited experience in marketing and distributing our travel services internationally 
we may not be able to expand our operations successfully in such markets 
conducting business on an international level also involves certain inherent risks  such as unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  currency rate fluctuations  seasonality in leisure travel in certain countries and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we may be unable to meet our future capital requirements 
we may not be able to fund our expansion  develop or enhance our products or services or respond to competitive pressures if we lack adequate funds 
this could hurt our business 
alternatively  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be diluted 
further  any new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the common stock 
we currently do not have any commitments for additional financing 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future to the extent required or that  if available  it will be on acceptable terms 
for more information on management s view of liquidity and capital resources  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
claims  infringement or misappropriation by third parties may hurt our business 
we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions  including trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees  customers  partners and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies 
we pursue the registration of certain of our key trademarks and service marks in the united states 
effective trademark  service mark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights  and we may be required to incur significant expenses preserving our rights 
in addition  other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
domain names we currently hold the internet domain name www 
cheaptickets 
com  as well as various other related names 
third parties may acquire domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights which may hurt our business 
domain names generally are regulated by internet regulatory bodies 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
regulatory bodies could establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
as a result  we may not acquire or maintain the www 
cheaptickets 
com domain name in all of the countries in which we conduct business 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
certain segments of the travel industry are heavily regulated by the united states and other governments 
accordingly  certain services offered by us are affected by such regulations 
new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could hurt our business 
we are subject to federal regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices 
in addition  federal regulations concerning the display and presentation of information currently applicable to airline booking services could be extended to us in the future  as well as other laws and regulations aimed at protecting customers accessing online or other travel services 
in california  hawaii and certain other states  we are required to register as a seller of travel  comply with certain disclosure requirements and participate in the state s restitution fund 
we are also subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations applicable to online commerce 
currently  few laws and regulations directly apply to the internet and commercial online services 
however  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet or commercial online services covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust and characteristics and quality of products and services 
further  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws 
such laws would likely impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or commercial online services 
in turn  this could decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  in many states  there is currently great uncertainty whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services 
these issues may take years to resolve 
for example  tax authorities in a number of states  as well as a congressional advisory commission  are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce  and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes 
federal legislation imposing certain limitations on the ability of states to impose taxes on internet based sales was enacted in the internet tax freedom act  as this legislation is known  imposes on electronic commerce a three year moratorium on state and local taxes imposed after october  but only where such taxes are discriminatory on internet access 
it is possible that the legislation could not be renewed when it terminates in october failure to renew the legislation could allow state and local government to impose taxes on internet based sales  and such taxes could hurt our business 
our stock price is likely to be volatile 
the market price of the common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control 
quarterly variations in our operating results  
operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  
changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  
changes in market valuations of other travel  internet or online service companies  
announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors  
announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
loss of one or more major travel suppliers  
additions or departures of key personnel  
future sales of our common stock  and 
stock market price and volume fluctuations 
domestic and international stock markets often experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations  as well as general political and economic conditions  such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market prices for stocks of internet related and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices often are not sustainable and are subject to wide variations 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the market price of our stock could be adversely affected because a significant portion of our stock is closely controlled 
at march   michael j 
hartley  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president of cheap tickets  and sandra t 
hartley  vice president  employee relations and director and wife of michael j 
hartley  together with their respective affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
such ownership could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
if they act together  they will effectively have the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and to control our management and affairs 
anti takeover provisions affecting us could prevent or delay a change of control 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock  but we may do so 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
moreover  the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of cheap tickets without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions permitting stockholders to take action by written consent with a two thirds vote and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of cheap tickets 
these governance provisions also could hurt the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cheap tickets does not use derivative financial instruments 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
