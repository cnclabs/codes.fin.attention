item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of fx energy should be read in conjunction with summary consolidated financial data  the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
corporate overview fx energy explores for oil and gas in the republic of poland  where it holds the largest exploration acreage position by a foreign company  in terms of both gross and net acres  covering approximately million gross acres 
fx energy is exploring most of its polish acreage with two strategic partners apache and pogc 
to date  fx energy has participated in drilling eight exploratory wells in poland 
the first seven exploratory wells were exploratory dry holes 
the eighth exploratory well  the wilga  which was drilled on the northwest edge of the lublin basin  was announced as an exploratory success on january  after initial production test results indicated a combined initial flow rate of mmcf of gas per day and bbls of condensate from three intervals in a carboniferous horizon at a depth between  and  feet 
under the terms of the apache exploration program  apache covered all of fx energy s share of costs to drill and complete the wilga the wilga was the first successful exploratory well drilled by a foreign operator in poland 
fx energy and its partners plan an appraisal well immediately  followed by additional development drilling and facilities construction later in the year  with initial production expected to commence during early in addition  fx energy will promptly begin seismic acquisition in the wilga area to identify a target near the wilga discovery to be drilled later this year to test the possibility of additional reserves outside the wilga structure 
apache has committed to covering fx energy s share of costs to drill five additional exploration wells in poland 
in the western united states  fx energy produces oil from fields in montana and nevada  has a contract drilling and well servicing company in northern montana and oil and gas exploration prospects in several western states 
since  when fx energy acquired oil and gas exploration rights to approximately million acres in the baltic project area in poland  fx energy has focused an increasing amount of resources and activities towards oil and gas exploration in poland 
to date  fx energy has acquired oil and gas exploration rights  including concessions and options on pogc controlled areas  covering approximately million gross acres  resulting in fx energy owning the largest gross and net acreage position by a foreign company in poland 
during the preceding five years  fx energy has minimized its financial exposure in poland by forming strategic alliances with several industry partners such as apache  pogc  homestake mining company and rwe dea formerly deutsche texaco 
during the third quarter of  fx energy realized net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock 
the proceeds from the stock offering were used to pay off long term debt of million and to fund fx energy s exploration activities for the remainder of through early in the second quarter of  fx energy realized net proceeds of million from the private placement of  shares of common stock 
proceeds from the private placement were allocated to fund costs incurred on the lachowice farm in during  continuing exploration costs in poland and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   fx energy had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities with no outstanding long term debt 
since its inception in through december   fx energy has incurred cumulative net losses of million  including net losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy may continue to incur net losses during and beyond  depending on results from its exploration  appraisal  development and property acquisition activities in poland and the western united states 
liquidity and capital resources historically  fx energy has relied primarily on proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund its operating and investing activities 
during  and  fx energy received net proceeds from the sale of its securities  net of redemptions  of   and  respectively 
fx energy also benefits from funds provided by other participants in drilling groups formed by it to undertake specific drilling or other exploration activities 
working capital fx energy had working capital of   and  as of december   and  respectively 
working capital as of december  was  higher as compared to the end of  primarily due to net proceeds of  from the private placement of  shares and the exercise of options to purchase  shares of common stock  which was offset by fx energy s  net loss during working capital as of december  was  lower as compared to the end of  primarily due to cash used in operating and financing activities of  and additions to properties of  during operating activities fx energy used net cash of   and  in its operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses incurred in those years 
during  and  fx energy spent   and  respectively  on operating activities exclusive of working capital adjustments 
working capital adjustments reduced cash used in operating activities by   and  during   and  respectively 
investing activities fx energy used net cash of  in investing activities during and received net cash from investing activities of  and  during and  respectively 
during  fx energy spent  on additions to properties  equipment and other assets  received  from the sale of property interests and spent a net amount of  relating to investing in marketable debt securities

during  fx energy advanced  to an officer  realized  in advances from rwe dea relating to exploration of its baltic project area and  from the exercise of warrants and options on  shares of common stock 
strategic alliances fx energy has benefited and anticipates that it will continue to benefit from strategic alliances with industry or financial partners to provide funding and expertise  which helps reduce fx energy s financial exposure and risk 
during the period of through june  fx energy estimates that its strategic partners have paid or committed to carry approximately  of fx energy s share of costs in various projects 
apache has committed to covering all of the apache exploration program s polish g a costs incurred from january through june  a net amount of approximately  during  apache committed to cover approximately  of fx energy s cost relating to exploring its carpathian area over approximately three years in exchange for a fifty percent percent interest in the project 
during  apache committed to cover approximately  of fx energy s cost relating to exploring its lublin basin area over approximately three years in exchange for a fifty percent percent interest in the project 
also  during  homestake committed to paying approximately  of fx energy s cost over approximately two years relating to gold exploration on the sudety project area in poland 
rwe dea committed approximately  to cover fx energy s cost relating to the baltic project area during and other industry partners committed approximately  to cover fx energy s costs in other projects during and exploration  appraisal  development and property acquisition activities in poland polish acreage fx energy holds oil and gas exploration rights on approximately million gross acres in poland as follows approximately million gross acres in which fx energy holds a one hundred percent interest  approximately million gross acres in which fx energy and apache each hold a fifty percent interest  approximately million gross acres in which fx energy and apache each hold a fifty percent interest subject to proportionate reduction by pogc s option to participate with up to a one third interest determined on a block by block basis  and  approximately million gross acres held by pogc in which fx energy and apache have options to participate with up to a one third interest each 
fx energy may relinquish all or part of its interest in any exploratory acreage at any time if it determines there is no hydrocarbon potential within any given area 
apache exploration program fx energy and apache entered into an ami agreement effective january   which further defined and modified several earlier agreements between fx energy and apache relating to their joint exploration activities in poland 
all of these agreements together  and the operations and obligations that relate to these agreements  are referred to as the apache exploration program 
the ami agreement covers the entire country of poland except for the million acre baltic project area 
under terms of the ami agreement  fx energy and apache must offer each other a fifty percent interest in any new exploration  appraisal  development  acquisition or other oil and gas activity entered into in poland during and under terms of the apache exploration program  apache has either paid or committed to pay fx energy s pro rata share of the following items initial completed remaining commitment commitments commitments up front cash   drilling costs wells wells wells d seismic  km  km km concession and usufruct fees 
  g a costs incurred in poland 
all through all to date all through as of december   apache had covered fx energy s pro rata share of costs for five exploratory wells  the first four of which were exploratory dry holes drilled during on january  fx energy announced the fifth well  the wilga  was an exploratory discovery 
apache completed acquiring  kilometers of d seismic in the lublin basin during and has committed to completing kilometers of d seismic in the carpathian area of southern poland during beginning july   apache may charge fx energy for of its polish g a costs  increased by upon the drilling of each of the five remaining exploratory wells  up to a maximum of 
exploratory activities apache exploration program the czernic  poniatowa  witkow and the siedliska  the first four exploratory wells drilled under terms of the apache exploration program  were all determined to be exploratory dry holes during the first nine months of these wells tested potentially productive carboniferous and devonian horizons in southeastern poland 
in accordance with terms of the apache exploration program  apache covered all of fx energy s share of costs for all three wells  including for the czernic  for the poniatowa  for the witkow and for the siedliska on january   fx energy announced the fifth well  the wilga  was an exploratory oil and gas discovery in the carboniferous horizon on the northwest section of the lublin basin 
apache has committed to cover all of fx energy s drilling and completion costs for the wilga the remaining five wells are expected to be drilled by apache during and during june  fx energy elected to participate in drilling the andrychow  an exploratory well operated by pogc on pogc option acreage in southern poland with a interest 
the well tested a devonian formation and was determined to be an exploratory dry hole during december the andrychow cost a net amount of approximately  lachowice farm in agreement on february   fx energy and apache entered into a farm in agreement with pogc with respect to pogc s lachowice area  a shut in devonian gas discovery owned by pogc 
under terms of the agreement  fx energy and apache each agreed to pay fifty percent of the cost to test and recomplete up to three shut in gas wells 
based upon the testing and recompletion results  fx energy and apache had the option to each earn a one third interest in the lachowice area by each paying fifty percent of the cost to drill three additional wells and construct related production facilities 
during june  fx energy and apache commenced testing and recompletion procedures on the stryszawa k 
the stryszawa k was subsequently plugged and abandoned after it failed to maintain a commercial production rate 
during september  fx energy and apache tested the lachowice to determine its commercial potential 
the test results of the lachowice did not warrant constructing gathering and processing facilities 
fx energy and apache plan turn the lachowice back to pogc and terminate the lachowice farm in 
during  fx energy incurred costs of approximately  on this project 
capital requirements general as of december   fx energy had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities with no long term debt 
in view of the apache exploration program  this amount is expected to be sufficient to fund fx energy s present minimum exploration and operating commitments during and part of fx energy intends to seek additional capital to fund any activities outside the scope of its present minimum exploration and operating activities  including further exploration  appraisal and development costs for the wilga discovery and any other additional exploration  appraisal  development or property acquisition activities 
the allocation of fx energy s capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures is discretionary and will depend upon future events that cannot be predicted 
such events include the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  property acquisition and other activities 
fx energy may obtain funds for future capital investments from the sale of additional securities  bank financing  project financing  sale of partial property interests  strategic alliances with other energy or financial partners or other arrangements  some of which may dilute the interest of existing shareholders in fx energy or fx energy s interest in the specific project financed 
there can be no assurance that additional funds could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms favorable to fx energy 
exploration  appraisal and development capital during the remainder of  fx energy expects to have substantially all the cost of its share of exploration activities under the apache exploration program covered by apache 
to date  apache has completed drilling five of the ten required exploratory wells and advises that it expects to drill three additional wells during during  fx energy incurred approximately  appraising the lachowice farm in 
fx energy initially allocated million of the net proceeds of its million private placement completed in may to partially fund planned activities related to the lachowice farm in 
based on the test results from re entering the stryszawa k and the lachowice  fx energy and apache have concluded the lachowice farm in is not economical and plan to withdraw from the project 
fx energy and its partners are formulating a program to commence production and fully develop the wilga field 
under terms of the apache exploration program  apache must cover all of fx energy s share of drilling and completion costs for the wilga  the initial exploratory well drilled on the wilga field 
fx energy must pay for its share of all subsequent capital and operating costs on the wilga field 
preliminary additional exploration  appraisal and development plans total approximately million net to fx energy and are comprised of the following o drill one appraisal well and one development well at a cost of approximately million per well  o build production facilities including connecting to a pipeline at a cost of approximately million  o acquire approximately kilometers of d seismic at a cost of approximately  and o drill a step out well costing approximately million 
fx energy may utilize the million shelf registration statement it filed during june  to fund the additional exploration  appraisal and development costs of the wilga field through a combination of debt and equity securities or it may utilize bank debt or other financing alternatives 
however  there is no assurance that such funding can be obtained 
additional exploration of the million acre baltic project area has been deferred for the time being 
due to its increasing focus on poland  fx energy expects to incur minimal exploration  appraisal and development expenditures on its domestic operations during the remainder of and property acquisition capital during june  fx energy filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to fund planned expansion in poland 
fx energy plans to utilize the million shelf registration statement to fund any capital requirements resulting from the proposed purchase of oil and gas property interests from pogc through a combination of debt and equity securities or may utilize bank debt or other financing alternatives 
there is no assurance any funds will be available pursuant to the million shelf registration statement 
results of operations by business segment fx energy operates within two segments of the oil and gas industry  exploration and production e p and drilling and well servicing drilling  and within the exploration segment of the mining industry 
in poland  fx energy explores for oil and gas  and to a limited extent  gold 
in the western united states  fx energy has a limited amount of exploratory acreage primarily in north dakota  produces oil in montana and nevada and has a contract drilling and well servicing company in northern montana 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs dd a directly associated with the production and drilling segments are detailed within the following discussion 
g a costs  interest income  other income  interest expense  officer loan impairment and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes and are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
mining  which consists of gold exploration on fx energy s sudety project area in poland  is excluded from the following discussion because it has been discontinued and is not considered to be a material segment by management 
e p operations oil and gas exploration and production revenues oil revenues oil revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  fx energy s oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices 
fx energy s oil revenues during  and were also negatively affected by lower production rates attributable to the natural production declines of fx energy s producing properties and the increased utilization of fx energy s well servicing equipment on third party properties rather than company owned properties during and a summary of the percentage change in oil revenues  average oil price and oil production for  and as compared to their respective prior year are set forth on the following table year ended december  oil revenues    percent change versus prior year 
average oil price percent change versus prior year 
production volumes bbls    percent change versus prior year 
gain on sale of property interests there was no gain on sale of property interests for the year ended december  fx energy recognized a gain on sale of property interests of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  apache paid fx energy  in initial cash consideration relating to its participation in the carpathian area which was offset by  of associated costs 
during  fx energy received  from apache in initial cash consideration relating to its participation in the lublin basin area which was offset by  of associated costs and  from the purchase of lubex petroleum company  fx energy s wholly owned polish exploration subsidiary which operates the original blocks within fx energy s lublin basin area 
the gain on sale of property interests also includes  relating to fx energy s mining operations  which are excluded from the discussion of the results of operations by business segment 
the amount of gain on sale of property interests will continue to vary from year to year  depending on the timing of completed deals and the amount of up front cash consideration  if any 
exploration and production costs lease operating costs fx energy s lease operating costs are composed of normal recurring lease operating expenses loe and production taxes 
lease operating costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and  respectively  per barrel 
loe costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and fx energy performed only routine maintenance on its producing properties and deferred workovers in an effort to control operating costs 
lifting costs per barrel exclusive of production taxes were relatively flat during  and  amounting to  and per barrel  respectively 
production taxes were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  production taxes decreased to an average of approximately of annual oil revenues  as compared to during and  primarily due to a reduction in the production tax rate on stripper wells by the state of montana 
the decrease in the amount of production taxes from year to year is also directly associated with the fluctuation of oil prices and decreased oil production from year to year 
refer to the table in exploration and production revenues oil revenues for the percentage fluctuations in the average oil price and oil production for  and dd a expense producing operations dd a expenses for producing properties were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the dd a rate per barrel was during  a decrease of as compared to the decrease is directly attributable to the  write down of fx energy s domestic proved developed oil and gas properties during which resulted in a substantially lower depreciable property basis during the dd a rate per barrel was relatively constant at and for and  respectively 
domestic proved property impairment there were no proved domestic proved property impairments for the years ended december  or for the year ended december   fx energy incurred a domestic proved developed property impairment of  due to low oil prices and its decision to focus its resources on poland 
as of december   fx energy s pv value for its domestic proved properties was approximately  consisting solely of proved developed reserves 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  fx energy recorded total impairment expense of  for the year ended december   which represented the difference between the net book value of its domestic proved developed properties and the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis  as of december  exploration costs fx energy s exploration costs consist of geological and geophysical costs g g  exploratory dry holes and non producing leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
g g costs of  and  incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  relate to fx energy s mining operations and are excluded from the following discussion of the results of operations for this segment 
a comparative discussion of each component of exploration costs incurred during the years ended december   and follows g g costs were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  fx energy spent approximately  reprocessing seismic on the pomeranian and warsaw west areas  granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant and spent approximately  evaluating potential property acquisitions from pogc 
during  fx energy incurred approximately  of cost relating to its share of the lublin basin area seismic acquisition program with apache and  relating to the polish lowlands study 
during  fx energy completed a seismic survey on wola  a pogc concession in the carpathian area  costing  from january  through december   fx energy spent an average amount of approximately  annually relating to reprocessing d seismic and the wages and associated expenses for employees and consultants directly engaged in g g activities 
g g costs are expected to continue at current or higher levels as fx energy increases its exploratory efforts in poland and continues to spend a limited amount on its exploratory acreage in the western united states 
exploratory dry hole costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  fx energy participated in drilling three exploratory dry holes  the witkow  siedliska and the andrychow in poland 
the witkow and siedliska wells were exploratory wells under the apache exploration program 
as such  apache covered all of fx energy s pro rata share of costs for the witkow and siedliska fx energy retained and paid for a five percent interest in the andrychow  an exploratory dry hole on the carpathian area of southern poland  which cost  on the lachowice farm in  fx energy plugged the stryszawa k after spending  on an unsuccessful recompletion attempt and plans to withdraw from the lachowice farm in project after spending  testing the lachowice also  during  fx energy spent  associated with an exploratory dry hole drilled during during  fx energy participated in drilling two exploratory dry holes  the czernic and the poniatowa  in poland on the lublin basin area 
both wells were plugged and abandoned during the first quarter of and counted as exploratory wells under the apache exploration program 
as such  apache covered all of fx energy s pro rata share of costs for each well 
all of the exploratory dry hole costs recorded during were associated with wells drilled prior to during  fx energy drilled four exploratory dry holes  two in poland and two in the western united states 
in poland  fx energy drilled the orneta  the first exploratory oil well drilled by a western company in poland  at a cost of  and the gladysze a at a cost of  both of which were on fx energy s baltic project area 
in the western united states  fx energy drilled the murray in central montana at a cost of  and the mega springs federal in nevada at a cost of  non producing leasehold impairments were  and  for the years ended december  and there were no non producing leasehold impairments during the year ended december  during  fx energy wrote off  relating to the lachowice farm in and  pertaining to its holt camp creek prospect in nevada 
during  fx energy wrote off  relating to its devil s basin prospect in central montana where the murray was drilled   relating to its mega springs prospect in nevada where the mega springs federal was drilled and  relating to its horse trap prospect in wyoming where fx energy no longer had drilling plans 
non producing leasehold impairments will vary from period to period based on fx energy s determination that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not realizable 
extraordinary gain baltic project area there were no extraordinary gains during the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to  for the year ended december  as of december   fx energy had  of long term debt associated with advances received from rwe dea relating to rwe dea s commitment to earn a fifty percent interest in fx energy s baltic project area 
during  rwe dea advanced fx energy an additional  bringing the total amount of such advances to  all of which fx energy recorded as notes payable prior to the polish government approving rwe dea s participation in fx energy s baltic project area 
on june   after the polish government had approved rwe dea s participation in the baltic project area  rwe dea elected not to earn an interest in fx energy s baltic project area 
fx energy was not contractually obligated to repay any funds previously advanced by rwe dea 
accordingly  fx energy eliminated its long term debt associated with the rwe dea advances and recognized an extraordinary gain of  for the year ended december  drilling and well servicing operations drilling revenues drilling revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy s contract drilling and well servicing operations generated a gross profit before dd a of  and during  and  respectively 
during  fx energy focused its drilling and well servicing equipment on third party contract services in an effort to increase its domestic revenues rather than utilizing its drilling and well servicing equipment on company owned properties 
during  fx energy s drilling revenues consisted of  from third party contract drilling and well servicing work conducted in the third and fourth quarters as fx energy began to shift the primary focus of utilizing its drilling and well servicing equipment from company owned properties to third party contract services 
during  fx energy drilled two wells on a day work contract basis resulting in revenues of  and a gross profit before dd a of  fx energy retained a working interest in each of the two wells drilled  a in the murray  a dry hole  and  a in the state  an oil discovery 
the  gross operating profit before dd a helped offset the combined working interest cost of  that fx energy incurred on the two wells 
drilling revenues will continue to fluctuate year to year based on the number  timing  retained working interest of wells drilled and the degree of emphasis on utilizing drilling and well servicing equipment on fx energy s company owned properties 
drilling costs drilling costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  drilling costs were  and of drilling revenues  respectively 
drilling costs are directly associated with drilling revenues 
as such  drilling costs will continue to fluctuate year to year based on revenues generated  the number of wells drilled  timing and the degree of emphasis on utilizing drilling and well servicing equipment on fx energy s company owned properties 
dd a expense drilling and well servicing operations dd a expenses for drilling and well servicing equipment were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy spent   and  on upgrading its drilling and well servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
dd a expense was progressively higher year to year due to prior year capital additions being depreciated in succeeding years 
non segmented information dd a expense corporate dd a expenses for corporate activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
dd a expenses during were  less as compared to the same period of  primarily due to less capital additions during coupled with equipment purchased during and becoming fully depreciated during fx energy spent   and  during  and  respectively  on software  hardware and office equipment utilized primarily for corporate purposes 
g a costs g a costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  g a costs were  higher as compared to the same period of due to higher payroll and other related costs associated with fx energy s increasing emphasis expanding on its polish activities 
g a costs incurred during were substantially unchanged as compared to g a expenses are expected to continue at current or higher levels as fx energy further expands its presence in poland 
interest and other income interest and other income were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy s cash  cash equivalent and marketable debt securities balance was   and  as of december   and  respectively 
the average cash and marketable securities balances during were relatively unchanged as compared to the same period of interest and other income was lower in as compared to due to lower average cash and marketable debt security balances during as compared to the same period of fx energy earned interest income of   and  during  and  respectively 
interest income associated with officers notes receivable was  and  during and  respectively 
interest expense interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fx energy had no interest expense for the year ended december  during  fx energy incurred  of interest expense primarily relating to the settlement of an audit by the blackfeet tribe pertaining to the cut bank field 
during  fx energy incurred interest expense of  fx energy had long term debt associated with rwe dea of  as of december  and received  in additional funding from rwe dea during the first six months of  all of which was recorded as long term debt 
however  upon rwe dea s election not to earn an interest in the baltic project area on june   fx energy eliminated its long term debt associated with rwe dea and recognized an extraordinary gain of  as of december  and  fx energy had no long term debt 
officer loan impairment as of december   notes receivable and accrued interest from officers  before impairment  totaled  with a due date of on or before december  as extended 
the notes receivable and accrued interest are collateralized by  shares of fx energy s common stock 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  fx energy recorded an impairment allowance of  as of december   based on the value of the underlying collateral 
the impairment allowance will be adjusted quarterly based on the market value of the collateral shares 
income taxes fx energy incurred net operating losses after extraordinary gains of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fx energy s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of fx energy s exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in fx energy s conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  fx energy did not recognize any tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   or net loss fx energy incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss in was due principally to  of exploration costs  an officer loan impairment of  and  of g a costs 
the net loss in was due principally to a domestic proved property impairment of  g g costs of  and a decline in oil prices coupled with a decline in oil production 
the net loss in was due principally to g g costs of  an exploratory dry hole costing  drilled without an outside partner and leasehold impairments of  capitalized costs for unproved oil and gas properties fx energy follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
as of december   fx energy had unproved property costs of  including  in poland and  in the united states 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net revenues determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as of december   fx energy had net proved property costs of  as compared to a proved reserves pv value of  as a result of the foregoing  the results of operations of fx energy for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
other matters fx energy has reviewed all recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on the results of operations or financial position of fx energy 
based on that review  fx energy believes that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk fx energy s major market risk exposure continues to be the price it receives for oil produced from its domestic properties 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil applicable to the united states  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
see item and business and properties risk factors volatility of commodity prices and markets 
fx energy does not engage in any hedging activities to protect itself against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although it may elect to do so if it achieves significant production in poland 
foreign currency risk fx energy has entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
fx energy conducts its day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of fx energy 
the exchange rates for the polish zloty were  and per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
fx energy does not now and does not intend in the foreseeable future to engage in hedging transactions to protect itself against currency risks
