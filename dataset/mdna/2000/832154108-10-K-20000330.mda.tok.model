item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general smith micro software  inc develops and sells ecommerce and communications software for personal and business use 
our objective is to enhance human interaction by giving users the ability to communicate through multimedia technologies over analog and digital platforms 
smith micro s products enable personal communication through telephony  fax  multimedia email  data  paging  video security and video conferencing 
smith micro s ecommerce software and services enable businesses to create and launch online internet storefronts 
recently  we have been developing new products that leverage off our core technologies to address the consumer s use of the internet and corporate intranets 
we intend to leverage our experience and position with original equipment manufacturers  commonly known as oems  to deploy these new product releases 
additionally  we are expanding our customer base to include manufacturers that produce devices that take advantage of the high bandwidth internet connectivity such as cable and xdsl modems 
the company s corporate products are designed to provide cost effective and efficient methods of communicating that take advantage of corporate local and wide area networks  including the internet or intranet 
as a result of our recent merger with pcs  development efforts are underway to combine the technologies originating from smith micro and pcs to expand the functionality of our ecommerce software and services 
we shipped our first data communication software product in and  since that time  we have generated revenues primarily from the market acceptance of our oem fax and data communication software products 
we began providing video communication products in to both oem and retail customers 
in january  we purchased certain fax software assets of mitek systems  inc to provide lan  internet and intranet fax transmission solutions designed for the corporate market 
in september  we shipped our first internet communications software product 
this multi purpose product provides for integrated telephony  multimedia e mail  video security  fax  video conferencing and text based chat functionality over the internet and other ip protocol services such as lans and wans 
designed to take advantage of high bandwidth technology  this product functions over a variety of ip connectivity hardware including xdsl modems  cable modems  network interface devices and analog modems 
in april we expanded our macintosh division with the stf acquisition 
stf develops and sells communications software  primarily fax  to the macintosh market 
goodwill recorded in the acquisition of stf was  and will be amortized over seven years 
our macintosh division is currently working to provide internet telephony products for this market 
in september  we merged with pcs to provide ecommerce business solutions 
in late  pcs sold its first copy of the original version of webcatalog  an internet store development software designed for the macintosh 
pcs began selling a windows version in early and recently released its unix version in late we recognize revenues from sales of our software as completed products are shipped and from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software 
any material reduction in demand for our products would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we continue to introduce new products and our future success will depend in part on the continued introduction of new and enhanced oem  retail and corporate products that achieve market acceptance 
revenues are net of estimated returns and other adjustments at the time the products are shipped 
we have allowed our customers to return unused software and to rotate stock for new versions of retail releases 
as a percentage of our net revenues  returns constituted in  in and in as a percentage of our net revenues  returns for stock rotation were in  
in and in although we have successfully expanded our oem customer base during the past two years  a small number of oem customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to com  primarily u 
s robotics and its subsidiaries  accounted for approximately of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in our three largest oem customers  including com  accounted for the following portions of our net revenues in  in and in any reduction  delay or change in orders from such customers could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the oem product ordering cycle beginning from placement of an order to shipment is very short 
oem customers generally operate under a just in time system and order software to be delivered as needed by their manufacturing operations 
we generally ship our products as we receive orders and  accordingly  we have historically operated with little backlog 
we do not consider backlog to be a significant indication of future performance 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
moreover  we generally do not produce software in advance of orders and  therefore  have not maintained a material amount of software inventory 
beginning in the third quarter of  we renewed our commitment of resources and efforts towards the retail channel 
our effort coincided with the launch of our first retail internet telephony product  internet commsuite 
our strongest retail product continues to be hotfax messagecenter  which provides fax  answering machine and data communication functionality via the pc 
we recently began to ship the retail version of our internet store software product  webcatalog builder 
we have expanded into new retail outlets  particularly office supply chains such as staples  office depot and office max and into numerous internet retail stores 
as a result of this expansion  sales to ingram micro  a retail distributor  were of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in inventory in the retail channel exposes us to product returns 
we consider this exposure when we establish allowances for product returns 
substantial returns of products from the retail channel could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
historical results of operations  percentage relationships and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentages of net revenues represented by each item in our statement of income 
year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss interest income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss compared to net revenues our net revenues increased to million for from million for although we experienced a decline in our windows fax product sold to modem manufacturers during  our efforts to diversify our markets generated the growth in our net revenues 
contributions to this increase came from our retail  macintosh and ecommerce products 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues  less cost of revenues  which includes costs of materials  costs related to the operations of our duplication facilities  freight charges and royalties to licensors 
our gross profit increased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in compared to in the increase in our gross profit during was due primarily to an increased amount of oem business derived from royalties  and the increase in retail revenue that has a higher gross margin 
operating expenses our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in from in the increase in our sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased expenditures for our major retail products  and our expansion efforts in the ecommerce and macintosh markets 
our merger with pacific coast software in september and the acquisition of stf technologies in april were the initial steps in our expansion within the ecommerce and macintosh markets 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our internet technologies 
our development efforts include work on our ecommerce products  internet telephony and videoconferencing products  including macintosh versions  wireless products and new camera support 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenditures increased to in from in the increase in costs was primarily due to the additional engineering resources acquired in the expansion of our macintosh division through the acquisition of stf technologies 
our general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our general operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenditures increased to in from in the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily the result of the amortization of goodwill related to the stf acquisition  an increased headcount for support services related to the macintosh division  and costs associated with the merger with pcs 
income taxes income tax expense was  in compared with an income tax benefit of million in during the third quarter of  we increased the valuation allowance to offset all deferred tax assets  as recent historical results of operations provide insufficient evidence that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
compared to net revenues our net revenues decreased to million for from million for this decrease in our revenue was the result of a decrease in sales to our largest oem analog modem customers  including com 
the decrease in sales resulted from a combination of factors  including changes in product mix resulting from the analog modem industry s acceptance of the v  k modem standard  reduced demand for certain fax products and pricing pressures within the analog modem industry 
in response to these factors  our revenues from sales to com in decreased when compared to this decrease in our revenues from analog modem manufacturers was partially offset by an increase in revenues from other oem customers  including pc manufacturers  and increased retail revenues 
during  net retail revenues increased approximately over net retail revenues 
gross profit our gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in compared to in the increase in our gross profit percentage was due to a shift in our product mix  our flexible manufacturing process and our improvement of controls over our manufacturing expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by the translation costs of certain software products 
operating expenses our selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in from in the increase in our sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased expenditures for our major retail products  including expenditures related to the introduction of internet commsuite  a multi function internet communications software product 
expenditures for our corporate and var product group  primarily our lan fax products  also increased in in  research and development expenses remained constant at million as compared to as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenditures increased to in from in an increase in the amortization of purchased technologies  primarily for the network fax technology that we acquired in  was offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits 
to date  we have not capitalized any of our software development expenses because our development efforts have been completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
however  significant new products that we develop in the future may require the capitalization of certain software development expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenditures increased to in from in  primarily due to the decrease in our net revenues 
the overall decrease was primarily due to the lower allowance for bad debt in and cost control measures that reduced most expense categories during income taxes during  our income tax benefit was of the loss before income taxes 
income tax benefit was million in and  in liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from proceeds generated by our initial public offering in net cash used in operations was million in compared to  in net cash provided by operating activities was  in the primary use of cash in and was the company s net loss  which in was partially offset by the non cash increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and depreciation and amortization 
the cash provided by operations in was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable that was offset by a net loss for the year 
we used million in cash in   in and  in  for investing activities 
our primary use of cash for investing activities related to our acquisition of stf technologies for million in cash and  shares of our common stock  and the acquisition of technology from mitek in we also invested in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment  during each of  and in   was generated from the financing activities  primarily the exercise of stock options  which was offset by the repayment of a loan assumed in the acquisition of stf 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we had million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and other adjustments 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent years 
we anticipate that our present cash balances  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs throughout year compliance smith micro is aware of the issues associated with computer systems related to the year as described in previously issued filings  we had developed plans to address the possible exposures related to the impact on our computer systems and other operations 
since entering the year  we have not experienced any disruptions to our business nor are we aware of any significant year related disruptions impacting our customers or suppliers 
we will continue to monitor our critical systems over the next several months but we do not anticipate any significant impact due to year exposures of our internal systems as well as from the activities of our suppliers and customers 
costs incurred to achieve year readiness were charged to expense as incurred and have been insignificant 
we currently offer software products that were designed to be year compliant 
our software products do not utilize dates in their primary functions 
we have evaluated our software products and their interaction with hardware  such as fax machines  and possible software applications  such as word processors  and believe that year problems will not affect the functionality of our software products 
however  it is possible that our products  or the hardware or software applications used by one of our customers  may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk smith micro s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
