subsequently  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas  deferring the effective date of sfas to years beginning after june  sfas will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair market value

the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company has not yet determined what effect  if any  sfas will have on the earnings and financial position of the company 
certain factors which may affect the company s future performance newspaper industry competition the company s business is concentrated in newspapers and other publications located primarily in small metropolitan and suburban areas in the united states 
revenues in the newspaper industry primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation 
competition for advertising expenditures and paid circulation comes from local  regional and national newspapers  shopping guides  television  radio  direct mail  on line services and other forms of communication and advertising media 
competition for newspaper advertising expenditures is based largely upon advertiser results  readership  advertising rates  demographics and circulation levels  while competition for circulation and readership is based largely upon the content of the newspaper  its price and the effectiveness of its distribution 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
dependence on local economies the company s advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenues are dependent on a variety of factors specific to the communities which the company s newspapers serve 
these factors include  among others  the size and demographic characteristics of the local population  local economic conditions in general  and the related retail segments in particular  and local weather conditions 
indebtedness the company has a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   the consolidated indebtedness of the company was approximately million  which represents a multiple of times the company s twelve months trailing ebitda of approximately million 
the ebitda is impacted by the loss of five days resulting from the company s decision to adopt a week fiscal year and to end on december  as of december   the company had a net stockholders deficit of approximately million and a total capitalization of million  and  thus  the percentage of the company s indebtedness to total capitalization was 
the company may incur additional indebtedness to fund operations  capital expenditures or future acquisitions 
the company believes that cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund its operations and to meet payment requirements under its term loans and the revolver under the credit agreement 
however  a decline in cash provided by operating activities  which could result from factors beyond the company s control  such as unfavorable economic conditions  an overall decline in advertising expenditures or increased competition  could impair the company s ability to service its debt 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on the company which restrict  among other things  the company s ability to declare dividends  redeem stock  incur indebtedness  create liens  sell assets  consummate mergers and make capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to air and water quality  storage tanks and the management and disposal of waste at its facilities 
to the best of the company s knowledge  its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently interpreted 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to the company  may give rise to additional costs which could be material 
furthermore  actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company is not aware of any pending legislation by federal  state or local governments relating to environmental matters which  if enacted  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company is in the process of monitoring groundwater contamination which has been detected at one of its facilities 
the company believes the remediation of any such groundwater contamination  if required  will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in may  one of the company s subsidiaries  acquired as part of the goodson acquisition  received a notice of potential liability in connection with a landfill superfund site 
the company is fully indemnified for all costs and liabilities arising out of this issue by the seller as part of the goodson acquisition purchase agreement 
acquisition strategy the company has grown through  and anticipates that it will continue to grow through  acquisitions of daily and non daily newspapers and similar publications 
acquisitions may expose the company to particular risks  including  without limitation  diversion of management s attention  assumption of liabilities and amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
depending on the value and nature of the consideration paid by the company for acquisitions  such acquisitions may have a dilutive impact on the company s earnings per share 
in making acquisitions  the company competes for acquisition targets with other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities  assessing the value  strengths and weaknesses of such opportunities  evaluating the costs of new growth opportunities at existing operations or managing the publications it owns and improving their operating efficiency 
historically  the company has financed acquisitions through cash on hand and borrowings  which borrowings have increased the company s indebtedness 
the company anticipates that it will finance future acquisitions through cash on hand  borrowings and issuances of capital stock 
the credit agreement limits acquisitions to certain permitted investments and newspapers in the united states  and requires that acquisitions be financed through certain permitted sources 
in addition  the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement may limit the company s ability to make acquisitions

the company s newsprint consumption excluding paper consumed in the company s commercial printing operations totaled approximately million in  which was approximately of the company s newspaper revenues 
in  the company consumed approximately  metric tons of newsprint 
the average price per metric ton of newsprint based on east coast transaction prices in  and was  and  respectively  as reported by the trade publication pulp and paper weekly 
the company has no long term contracts to purchase newsprint 
generally  the company purchases all of its newsprint from two suppliers 
historically  the percentage of the company s newsprint supplied by each of such suppliers has varied 
the company believes that it would not be materially adversely effected if it were no longer able to purchase its newsprint supply from its two current suppliers and that  in such event  other newsprint suppliers would be readily available to the company 
in the future  the company may purchase newsprint from other suppliers 
the inability of the company to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
historically  the price of newsprint has been cyclical and volatile 
the company s average price per ton of newsprint consumed decreased approximately in  increased approximately in and decreased approximately in  in each case compared to the previous year 
the company believes that if any price increase or decrease is sustained in the industry  the company will also be impacted by such increase or decrease 
the company is unable to predict whether  or to what extent  any increase or decrease will be sustained 
significant increases in newsprint costs could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company seeks to manage the effects of increases in prices of newsprint through a combination of  among other things  technology improvements  including web width reductions  inventory management and advertising and circulation price increases 
the company also has reduced fringe circulation in response to increased newsprint prices  as it is the company s experience that such circulation does not provide adequate response for advertisers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in interest rates associated with its long term debt obligations 
the company s long term debt is at variable interest rates based on certain interest rate spreads applied to libor  the prime rate or federal funds rate as defined in the credit agreement 
to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the company  as required by its credit agreement  enters into certain interest rate protection agreements  which allows the company to exchange variable rate interest for fixed rate  maturing at specific intervals 
the difference to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the debt 
the related amount payable to or receivable from counterparties is included in accrued interest 
the company s use of these agreements is limited to hedging activities and not for trading or speculative activity
