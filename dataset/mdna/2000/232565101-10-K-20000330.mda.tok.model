item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we held a total of million of cash and cash equivalents 
these securities consist primarily of money market funds and high grade  short term corporate obligations 
certain of these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels as of december   the decline in fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
we transact substantially all of our revenues and costs in us dollars and our results of operations would not be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
accordingly  to date  we have not used material amounts of derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we had no fixed rate obligations except for capitalized leases and long term debt of approximately  as such  the fair value of our fixed rate obligations is not subject to a material adverse impact from changes in interest rates
