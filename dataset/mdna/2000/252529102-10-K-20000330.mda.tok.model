item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects increased revenues of our pennsylvania dialysis centers of approximately  including increased revenues of approximately  for our dialysis center located in chambersburg  pennsylvania  which commenced operations in january   and increased revenues of approximately  for our manahawkin  new jersey center  which received regulatory approval in december  although the operations of new centers have resulted in additional revenues  they are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely affect our results of operations until they achieve a sufficient patient count to cover fixed operating costs 
interest and other income decreased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year 
this decrease is largely due to a decrease in interest earned as a result of a decrease in invested funds 
cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in  reflecting an increase in supply costs as a percentage of sales and a decrease in healthcare salaries as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  for compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflected operations of the company s new dialysis centers   in compensation expense from issuance of stock options and approximately  associated with our decision not to go through with plans to construct a facility in toms river  new jersey  as well as increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of medical services revenue amounted to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year 
as a result of having centers in the developmental stage which have not achieved a sufficient patient count to sustain profitable operations  we have continued to experience operational losses 
interest expense decreased by approximately  during the comparable periods largely as a result of reduced average outstanding borrowings 
compared to medical service revenues decreased approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year 
this decrease reflects the loss of revenues  which amounted to approximately  for the preceding year  from the sale of our florida dialysis operations on october   which was offset to some degree by increased revenues of our pennsylvania dialysis centers of approximately  including increased revenues of approximately  at our dialysis center located in carlisle  pennsylvania  which commenced operations in july and  from a new dialysis center located in manahawkin  new jersey  which received regulatory approval in december  although the operations of these centers have resulted in additional revenues  they are in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely affect our results of operations until they achieve a sufficient patient count to cover fixed operating costs 
interest and other income increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year 
this increase is largely due to interest earned on proceeds invested from the october sale of our florida dialysis operations 
revenues for included a gain of approximately  upon the sale of substantially all of the assets of our florida subsidiary  and its related operations

interest expense decreased by approximately  during the comparable periods largely as a result of reduced average outstanding borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources working capital totaled  at december   which reflected a decrease of approximately  during the current year 
included in the changes in components of working capital was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  which included net cash used in operating activities of  net cash used in investing activities of  including additions to property and equipment of  primarily related to new centers  and net cash used in financing activities of  including a decrease in the advances due from our parent of  and debt repayments of 
the change in working capital also reflected increases of approximately  in accounts receivable and  in accounts payable due to increased sales activity 
other current assets increased approximately  largely as a result of an income tax receivable of approximately  and income taxes payable decreased  due to payment of taxes 
we have mortgages on two of our buildings  one in lemoyne  pennsylvania and the other in easton  maryland  with a combined balance of approximately  at december  the bank has liens on our real and personal property  including a lien on all rents due and security deposits from the rental of these properties 
an unaffiliated competitive maryland dialysis center continues to lease space from us in our building 
the pennsylvania center relocated during and we constructed our own dialysis facility at the property that commenced treatments in june see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an equipment financing agreement for kidney dialysis machines for our facilities  which has an outstanding balance of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  this included additional equipment financing of approximately  during see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we opened our fifth center in chambersburg  pennsylvania in january  and opened our sixth center in vineland  new jersey in february  capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  depending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility is more expensive than construction  although acquisition provides us with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating income 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually months or longer to generate income 
we consider three of our centers  carlisle  pennsylvania and manahawkin and vineland in new jersey  to be in the developmental stage  since they have not developed a patient base sufficient to generate and sustain earnings for those subsidiaries 
carlisle and manahawkin have been operational for approximately months and months  respectively 
we have entered into agreements with medical directors  and intend to establish additional facilities in georgia and ohio 
we are seeking to expand our outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care 
such expansion  whether through acquisitions of existing centers or the development of our own dialysis centers requires capital  which was the basis for our security offering in and sale of our florida dialysis operations in we are presently in different phases of negotiations with approximately physicians for additional outpatient centers in georgia  maryland  new jersey ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina and virginia 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy or that our available funds will be adequate to finance such expansion 
see item  business business strategy and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current levels of working capital will enable us to meet our liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months as well as expand our dialysis facilities and thereby our patient base 
in january   we loaned  to our parent  medicore  at an annual interest rate of  with the loan and accrued interest to be repaid by the parent on january  the parent utilized this loan to fund a loan by it to linux global partners  which invests in linux software companies  in conjunction with which the parent acquired a ownership interest in linux for  with an option to increase its ownership to  which would include making an additional loan of  to linux for which the parent would borrow the funds from us 
year readiness the year computer information processing challenge associated with the recent millennium change concerned the ability of computerized information systems to properly recognize date sensitive information  with which many companies  public and private  were faced to ensure continued proper operations and reporting of financial condition 
management was fully aware of the year issues  made its assessments  which included testing each component of software and hardware systems to insure each component operated properly with the date advanced to the year  developing awareness and educating employees and patients regarding the year issue and advising them of contingency plans  in case of total operating failure  which would include transferring the patients to our backup hospitals or referring to other non affiliated dialysis centers 
the education phase was ongoing to assure staff and patients of the nature of the year issue and the contingency plans then available 
now that the year has arrived  we have not experienced any computer or other year problems within any of our systems or with third party suppliers or providers 
in mid year  we installed a new year compliant accounting package  providing us with our own independent system of bookkeeping  accounting and financial records and reducing our reliance on medicore s system and staff 
this new system s cost  for equipment  software and training  was approximately one of the most significant risks in our operations with respect to the recent millenium change related to billing and collection from third party payors  and  in particular  medicare 
we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from medicare for treatment of dialysis patients and related services 
hcfa  through whom the medicare program and payments are effected  has indicated it has done and continues to accomplish all it can to insure the medicare esrd program continues operating smoothly and that dialysis providers  like ourselves  may continue to timely bill electronically for patient services with medicare payments to be made timely 
in  we installed a new electronic billing software program that was developed according to medicare s compliance guidelines  which guidelines require not only system but also year compatibility 
we initiated electronic medicare billing in january  without any problems 
other third party payors  such as insurance companies  are presently billed with hard copy 
the costs of the software modifications were minimal  approximately  and we do not anticipate any further costs with respect to year compliance  and  if any  such would not be anticipated to be material 
with respect to non information technology systems  which typically include embedded technology  such as microcontrollers  the major equipment used in patient dialysis treatment is not date sensitive and did not pose any threat of a system breakdown due to the year issue 
most of our dialysis equipment is new 
we retain technicians who test and maintain dialysis operations equipment 
in addition to addressing our own internal software system and equipment  we had communicated with all of our suppliers  service providers and other key third parties  including banks  hospitals  insurance companies  drug and medical equipment and soft good suppliers  utilities  waste removal and water and sewer services with whom we deal to determine the extent of their year compliance  what actions they were taking to assess and address that issue  and whether they would be compliant 
we received written assurances from these third parties indicating that they were year compliant  and  in fact  we have not experienced any material adverse effects in entering into the year we assumed a worse case scenario that some of our critical suppliers might experience a millenium problem and limit  delay or be unable to deliver supplies for patient treatment 
in response  we identified other sources of supplies and maintained specific contacts with those suppliers  and had it been necessary  which it was not  would have requested those suppliers to carry more inventory earmarked for us 
at the millenium change there were no supply problems 
another area that could have significantly impacted our operations in providing dialysis treatment to patients related to third party providers  specifically  the utility companies providing water  a necessary resource for dialysis treatments  and electricity 
these providers and services are beyond our control  and we do not have a separate generator for electricity nor other sources for water 
none of these utilities have failed to provide services 
however  we had in place plans to reduce the impact of any such utility shortages or outages which included notification to our utilities companies of our dialysis center locations  schedules and emergency services required and a hour contact as well as notification to each of our landlords to assure access to the facility for our staff and key service providers 
we have not experienced any material unanticipated negative consequences from the year issues 
we believe our assessment and implementation of our year issues were satisfactorily completed  as evidenced by our continued and uninterrupted dialysis operations 
however  we have only just entered the new millenium  and there may yet arise year problems that we are not aware of these unknowns do not allow us the ability to predict with any significant accuracy or to quantify these year issues impact upon us  since they would involve uncertainty of costs we might incur as a result of these unknown year failures that might yet occur despite the successful implementation of our program 
new accounting pronouncement in june   the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires  among other things  that all derivatives be reorganized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that these instruments be measured at fair value 
we are in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of fas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
proposed merger and acquisition on october   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which mainstreet would merge with us and own approximately of our company 
that proposed transaction also provides for a simultaneous sale of our operations to our parent in consideration for approximately of the parent s ownership of the company  our parent s assumption of our long term debt and other liabilities  and our parent s waiver of most proceeds from the potential exercise of outstanding warrants and under writers options 
see item  business important developments and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
loan to parent company on january   our parent borrowed  from us with a annual interest rate  with the loan to be repaid with accrued interest by january  an additional  was borrowed from us by our parent under the same terms as the original borrowing 
our parent utilized the monies to loan to linux global partners  a holding company investing in linux software companies 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements and certain relationships and related transactions of our information statement relating to our annual meeting of shareholders anticipated to be held on may   which is incorporated herein by reference 
recent developments effective march   bart pelstring resigned as president  succeeded by stephen everett  formerly our executive vice president 
mr 
pelstring will remain as a director of the company and our subsidiaries 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
see operations medicare reimbursement and government regulation under item  business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntary increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not consider our exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities of which we held approximately  at december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate mortgage obligations which totaled  at december  we have has exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments in government securities and a increase in rates on our year end mortgage debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our result of operations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently use interest rate derivatives
