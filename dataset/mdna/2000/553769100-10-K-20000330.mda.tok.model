this property s hotel and food and beverage facilities were re opened in march the company had no revenues from gaming operations at either property during and through september on october   the company took over gaming operations at the two nevada properties 
the gaming revenue for the three months of operation in was  the sources of the remaining revenues for were million from lodging   from food and beverage and  in other income 
gaming operations revenues from gaming operations increased from million in to million in management attributes the dramatic increase to the following factors the increase in machine count from  to  by introducing progressive video slots  the introduction of coin drop slot machines in november  the july increase in ratio from to of gaming machines located at the lodge as compared to the racetrack building  continued aggressive marketing  and the expanded hours of operation for the track based gaming machines commencing in june of resulting in a increase in the net win per machine per day for such machines 
an amendment of the lottery law that became effective in june of permitted mountaineer park to change the ratio of video slots located in the lodge versus the racetrack building from to terminals located in the lodge s speakeasy gaming saloon are more popular than those at the racetrack and account for significantly more revenue 
to capitalize on the change in law  the company constructed a  square foot addition to the lodge s speakeasy gaming saloon  obtained regulatory approval to increase the total number of video slots from  to  by leasing new nickel machines  and placed video slots in the lodge and in the racetrack building as of july  
in january of  an additional progressive gaming machines were placed in the gaming areas 
in december  mountaineer park leased more video slots in the speakeasy and in the racetrack building from a third manufacturer in anticipation of initiating four progressive video slot banks 
these machines were placed in service on december  and therefore did not have a material impact on operations for the year ended december  since may   mountaineer has paid approximately  in large progressive jackpots 
in april of  the lottery law was amended  effective june   to permit mountaineer park to operate coin drop  mechanical reel las vegas style slot machines 
on june   in anticipation of adding coin drop machines  the company began increasing the number of days during which the machines located at the racetrack remain in operation 
previously  those machines operated only on live racing days and during special events 
also the speedway gaming room was built to house new coin drop machines in the track s lower grandstand 
in november of  mountaineer park introduced its first coin drop machines

the north las vegas property had gaming revenues of  for the three months ending december  the reno property s gaming revenues were  for the same period 
the company believes after the scheduled grand openings in march and april of  with a more aggressive advertising campaign and the completion of the renovations at the two locations  these amounts will significantly increase 
parimutuel commissions parimutuel commissions revenue is a function of wagering handle  which means the total amount wagered without regard to predetermined deductions  with a higher commission earned on a more exotic wager  such as a trifecta  than on a single horse wager  such as a win  place  or show bet 
in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the total wagering handle is composed of the amounts wagered by each individual according to the wagering activity 
the total amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a take out or gross commission  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the company s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total wagering handle or total amounts wagered 
the company earned an average commission rate of in each of the past three years 
parimutuel commissions for the twelve months ended december  and are summarized below 
twelve months ended december live racing parimutuel handle   simulcast racing parimutuel handle   less patrons winning tickets   state and county parimutuel tax   purses and horsemen s association   revenues parimutuel commissions   despite a increase in the average daily purses from  in to  in and higher patron volume  total revenues for parimutuel commissions for the year ending december  decreased in comparison to live racing handle decreased to million in from million in simulcast handle in decreased by  to million in comparison to the same period in management attributes the decrease in parimutuel revenue largely to the scheduling of special events such as concerts and boxing matches on live race days 
management had hoped that new patrons drawn by special events would likewise become parimutuel wagering and slot patrons 
the anticipated increase in slot revenue was realized while the increase in parimutuel handle was not 
these events in have been scheduled for evenings that will not conflict with regularly scheduled race days 
management does not expect results from racing operations to improve materially  despite larger daily purses  stakes races  better horses and larger patron volume for the resort  unless and until mountaineer park also commences export simulcasting 
export simulcasting would not only create a new source of revenue but the anticipated related increase in gross dollars wagered on mountaineer park s live races should also generate increases in live handle as a greater and more diverse wagering pool lessens the impact a particular wager will have on the pay off odds 
the commencement of export simulcasting would involve substantial capital improvements approximately million 
in december of  mountaineer park and its horsemen executed an agreement  subject to the approval of the west virginia racing commission  with respect to the sharing of the cost of such capital improvements 
the racing commission sought the advice of the state attorney general s office  which originally believed that the arrangement would violate the state s racing statue 
the company asked the attorney general s office to reconsider that conclusion 
at the same time  the company pursued legislation to make plain that the statute permitted the agreement 
on march   the west virginia state legislature passed house bill amending the statute to permit such agreements 
on march   the governor signed the bill into law 
the company will again ask the racing commission to approve the cost sharing agreement 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate commencement of export simulcasting until approximately days after the racing commission approves the cost sharing agreement 
thus  no assurances can be given that the company will successfully commence export simulcasting  or commence such activity within the anticipated time  or that the anticipated results will be realized
