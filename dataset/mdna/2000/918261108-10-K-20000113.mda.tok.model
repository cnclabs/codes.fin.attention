quarterly fluctuations and seasonality the following table sets forth certain quarterly income statement data and ebitda for each of the company s last three fiscal years  which were derived from unaudited financial statements of the company 
in the opinion of the company s management  this income statement data contains all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
quarters ended december march june september fiscal year in thousands fiscal total revenues      ebitda      operating income      fiscal total revenues      ebitda      operating income loss    fiscal total revenues      ebitda      operating income loss   ebitda is calculated herein as income before income taxes  extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle plus depreciation  amortization and net interest expense 
the company believes that ebitda serves as an important financial analysis tool for measuring and comparing financial information such as liquidity  operating performance and leverage 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income or other cash flow measures determined under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of the company s performance or liquidity 
ebitda as disclosed herein may not be comparable to ebitda as disclosed by other companies 
the company has experienced and is expected to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results  both between different quarters within the same fiscal year and with respect to the same quarter between different fiscal years 
these fluctuations arise from several factors  including the timing and dollar value of sales type leases with customers  the dependence of the company on concert tours  which are unpredictable in timing and duration  the introduction of new products and general economic conditions both domestically and internationally 
because of the possibilities of significant fluctuations  results for any quarter may not be indicative of results that may be achieved in a full year

ebitda and operating loss for the quarter ended september   include charges totaling million for employee termination costs associated with restructuring the company s operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations and capital expenditures with cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and advances from distributors and customers 
the company s operating activities generated cash flow of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company borrowed under a multicurrency credit agreement the old credit agreement to partially finance its operations and capital expenditures 
on october   the company consummated the initial public offering of its common stock and used the net proceeds thereof  approximately million  to repay indebtedness under the old credit agreement 
on december   the company entered into a million multicurrency revolving credit facility the new credit facility and canceled its existing credit facility 
at september   the commitment under the amended new credit facility was million  which decreases to million on march  and million on april   and the loan matures on january  borrowings under the amended new credit facility were million at september  and bear interest at the lender s base rate plus a rate margin ranging from to based upon the company s ratio of adjusted funded debt to ebitda as defined in the new credit facility and are secured by substantially all of the assets owned by the company s domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of of the outstanding capital stock of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
a commitment fee is charged on the average daily unused portion of the new credit facility at a rate ranging from to per annum based upon the ratio of adjusted funded debt to ebitda 
the amended new credit facility contains compliance covenants  including requirements that the company achieve certain financial ratios 
in addition  the amended new credit facility places limitations on annual capital expenditures and on the ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain loans or investments  sell assets  pay dividends or reacquire the company s stock 
in december  the company expensed deferred financing costs related to the prior debt facility of million net of tax benefit of million relating to the early extinguishment of debt  which have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income as an extraordinary loss 
as of september   the company has a principal payment of approximately million due in april the company has used proceeds of approximately million from asset sales and equipment financings to reduce this obligation subsequent to september  the company expects that it will be able to meet its remaining obligation on april  through the use of funds from operations  the deferral of certain planned capital expenditures  debt financings and refinancings or asset dispositions 
in the event that the company does not meet its obligation on april   the lenders will be entitled to pursue all rights available under the new credit facility 
subsequent to september   the company was in violation of two technical covenants of its new credit facility 
on january   the company signed an amendment to its new credit facility that waived the violations and modified the covenants 
management believes they can meet these covenants in the future 
the company has typically hedged a portion of its currency fluctuation risk by borrowing in french francs  british pounds sterling and japanese yen under its new credit facility 
cash generated from the company s france  england and japan offices is typically denominated in french francs  british pounds sterling and japanese yen  respectively  and is used to pay expenses incurred in those currencies and service any foreign currency borrowings 
the amendment to the new credit facility  on january   eliminated the company s ability to borrow foreign currencies under the new credit facility 
in the future  the company may use other financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency fluctuation risk 
prior to fiscal  the company had funded the costs to manufacture automated lighting equipment to be rented to certain distributors with advances made by the distributors under the terms of the company s distributorship agreements 
the distributors typically advanced to the company an amount equal to the cost to manufacture the equipment  and entered into agreements whereby the distributors had the exclusive right to sublease the lighting equipment within defined territories 
borrowings by the company under these agreements  which are secured by liens against the applicable equipment  are repaid by the company through future rentals due from the distributors under the terms of their distributorship agreements and bear interest at various rates ranging up to annually 
proceeds received under these distributorship agreements were approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and outstanding borrowings from distributors at september   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
all amounts advanced by distributors are accounted for by the company as short term debt 
see business marketing  sales and distribution 
the company has borrowed money to purchase computer equipment and office furniture and fixtures and conventional lighting equipment 
these loans typically amortize over three years and bear interest at various rates ranging from to 
proceeds received under this type of financing were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and borrowings outstanding under this type of financing at september   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in november  the company borrowed an additional under a three year amortizing loan 
the company has also used customer advances to fund short term working capital and immediate capital expenditure needs for specific contracts 
as of september   and  the company had unearned revenue related to customer advances of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
dividends paid to stockholders totaled approximately million with respect to fiscal the company did not pay dividends in fiscal and and does not anticipate paying any additional cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
see market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
historically  the company s business has required significant capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  of which approximately million  million and million were for rental equipment inventories 
the majority of the company s revenues are generated through the rental of automated lighting and concert sound systems and  as such  the company must maintain a significant amount of rental equipment to meet customer demands 
total rental equipment inventories increased from approximately million at the beginning of fiscal to million at september  this increase primarily consisted of automated lighting equipment  including new products  additional inventory of existing products and the replacement of equipment leased under sales type leases 
the amended new credit facility limits the company s capital expenditures in fiscal to million  which will be used primarily to purchase rental equipment 
inventory included in current assets consists primarily of spare parts inventory for the company s vari lite registered trademark automated lighting equipment and  until the sale of the irideon registered trademark product line in october  raw materials and finished goods for irideon registered trademark products 
raw materials represented  and of total inventory at september   and  respectively 
the company had a working capital deficit of approximately million at september  the company had a working capital surplus of million at september  and a working capital deficit of approximately million at september  the company has historically maintained working capital deficits since the bulk of its revenue generating assets are classified as long term assets rather than current assets 
the working capital surplus in was primarily the result of terminating the old credit agreement  which included borrowings classified as current at september   with proceeds from the new credit facility 
management believes that cash flow generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the new credit facility will not be sufficient to meet the scheduled commitment reductions under the new credit facility  the anticipated operating cash needs and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
additionally  the new credit facility has a maturity date of january  at which time the entire amounts outstanding under the facility will become due 
the company is currently in discussions with several banks regarding the refinancing of the new credit facility 
the company s management believes that they will obtain adequate cash from operations  cost reductions  deferral of capital expenditures  asset sales  other financing sources and either proceeds from a new credit agreement or an amendment to the new credit facility to meet the company s needs for the next twelve months and for the maturity of the new credit facility 
because the company s future operating results will depend on a number of factors  including the demand for the company s products and services  the success of the company to market  sale and support products sold  the level of competition  the success of the company s research and development programs  the ability to achieve competitive and technological advances and general and economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control  there can be no assurance that sufficient capital resources will be available to fund the expected expansion of its business beyond such period 
inflation the company has generally been able to offset cost increases with increases in the rental rates and sales prices charged for its products and services 
accordingly  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
impact of the year issue the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year was approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
in and  the company invested approximately million constructing a wide area network throughout the united states and implementing oracle financial and manufacturing applications 
in october  the company developed an extensive year readiness plan 
this was a comprehensive project to review and modify  as necessary  its computer applications  hardware and other equipment to make them year compliant 
the project was organized into three principal areas hardware software on desktop systems  hardware software on embedded systems and hardware software on enterprise systems 
each of these areas involved inventory  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company completed all business critical systems remediation  testing and implementation by september of in addition  the company obtained compliance statements from all major vendors  customers and manufactures of all computer related equipment and devices 
as a result of the successful implementation and deployment of the company s year readiness plan  the company has experienced no downtime or loss of any information as a result of the year change over 
the company is committed to continuous monitoring of all systems  applications and operating systems 
updates for applications and operating systems will be obtained as they become necessary and available 
all new systems and software will be added only after compliance has been verified

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency 
as of september   with all other variables held constant  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately million
