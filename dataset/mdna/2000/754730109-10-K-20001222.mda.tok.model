the first half of fiscal brought the end to a record setting period in the company s investment banking business as small and mid cap stocks began to weaken  particularly in certain industry sectors  which severely slowed the new issue deal flow 
investment banking revenues in fiscal remained slow as a result of several of the company s major sectors of emphasis energy  real estate and health care being out of favor for most of the year and the company being behind schedule in developing a significant technology investment banking and research effort 
the improved results in fiscal reflect the increase in the company s capacity in the technology sector  particularly telecommunications  and improved market conditions in other sectors such as energy

fiscal trading results reflect significantly improved municipal bond and over the counter equity trading results  with the industry having adapted to the changes in the over the counter regulations made in fiscal trading results in fiscal reflected particularly strong corporate and government bond trading results 
after several years of relatively consistent trading profits  derived primarily from client order flow in both over the counter equity and fixed income securities  changes in the over the counter equity trading regulations and practices in fiscal resulted in lower trading profits on those securities 
financial service fees increased in fiscal a result of the company s increased client base 
the roney acquisition in may brought clients that contributed to fee income for an entire year in fiscal in addition  the strong recruiting of independent contractors in both fiscal and contributed to the increased client base

sales commission expense increased each period at a rate approximately proportionate to the related revenues 
administrative and benefit compensation costs have typically increased at a rate consistent with the growth in total revenues 
however  the fiscal increase exceeded the growth in revenues as a result of continued hiring to support transaction volume  including the personnel acquired in the roney transaction  and the recruiting of investment bankers and research analysts during a period of decreased investment banking revenues 
this was reversed in fiscal as revenues grew and administrative and clerical personnel costs increased only  providing part of the company s leverage which resulted in improved margins 
incentive compensation expenses  including contributions to qualified retirement plans  are based on departmental  subsidiary and firm wide profitability 
this expense increased ratably with the company s net income in fiscal despite lower investment banking results in fiscal  improved results in other segments held the decrease in total incentive compensation expense to a rate below the decrease in net income 
in contrast  strong underwriting activity in fiscal resulted in record investment banking departmental profits  having a significant upward impact on incentive compensation 
while costs associated with overall growth continue to affect communications and information processing expense  there were also some significant individual items such as yk testing and the development of the former roney headquarters in detroit as a disaster recovery processing center during fiscal fiscal included costs associated with the integration of roney  preparation for yk and the merger creating rjfs 
the increases in communications and information processing expense in all three fiscal years include the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the company s systems of internal communication and information dissemination  as well as higher general business volume  which gave rise to increased costs for telephone  printing and supplies 
increased occupancy in fiscal includes expanded rja retail and institutional offices and additional space in detroit 
both fiscal and include the full annual effect of the completion and occupancy of the third headquarters building in the spring of clearing and floor brokerage increased a modest  a result of increased transaction volume and higher international clearing costs 
as in the past  clearing and floor brokerage expense increased at a rate lower than the growth in related revenues due to volume efficiencies and cost saving measures implemented 
the company held business development expenses close to even with the prior year 
however  they are expected to increase in fiscal as the company initiates increased television advertising and some additional branding efforts on a trial basis under the guidance of an advertising agency 
several of the company s branding initiatives impacted business development expense in fiscal and  including the stadium naming rights  general image advertising costs primarily television  and recruiting related programs capitalizing on the creation of rjfs 
fiscal s other expense includes the increase in legal reserves related to the corporex judgment discussed in note in addition  this expense category includes fees paid to outside managers in the company s growing investment advisory services program  bank service charges  legal expenses and provisions  and amortization of goodwill arising from the roney acquisition
