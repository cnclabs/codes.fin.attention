the company includes in its calculation of ffo the gains or losses realized from its disposition activity  measured as the sale price  net of selling costs  less book value and adding back accumulated depreciation 
the disposition of stabilized properties  and the recycling of capital and profits to new value added investments  is fundamental to the company s business focus and funding strategy 
in the company s view  ffo is appropriately adjusted by results of this core  regular and recurring activity  although period to period variability is possible because of changing market conditions and the progress of individual disposition negotiations 
on a cash basis  when comparing the results of operations of properties owned january  with the results of operations of the same properties for the same store portfolio  the company recognized an increase of approximately in net operating income 
this same store increase was due to the timely lease up of vacant space  rental increases on renewed leases and contractual increases in minimum rent under leases in place 
the company assesses its operating results  in part  by comparing the net revenue margin between periods 
net revenue margin is calculated for the in service portfolio by dividing net revenue total operating and investment revenue less real estate taxes and property operating and leasing expense by adjusted operating and investment revenue operating and investment revenue less expense reimbursements  adjusted for leases containing expense stops

the margin for was compared with for liquidity and capital resources operating and investment cash flow cash flow generated from company operations has historically been utilized for working capital purposes and distributions  while proceeds from stabilized asset dispositions  supplemented by unsecured financings and periodic capital raises  have been used to fund  on a long term basis  acquisitions and other capital costs

the company also repaid million of mortgage notes payable with further advances on the company s line of credit 
these interim balances were substantially refinanced with the proceeds of debt and preferred stock offerings described below 
equity and share activity in june   the company completed a public offering of  shares of series b convertible cumulative redeemable preferred shares at per share 
the shares have no maturity date  but may be redeemed by the company for per share after june  the shares are convertible into common shares at a conversion price of per common share  equivalent to a conversion rate of to the net proceeds of the offering  approximately million  were used to refund outstanding balances under the company s unsecured line of credit

also  the company paid dividends on preferred shares  series a  of million or per share and paid dividends on convertible preferred shares  series b  of million or per share 
the following factors  among others  will affect the future availability of funds for distribution i scheduled increases in base rents under existing leases  ii changes in minimum base rents attributable to replacement of existing leases with new or replacement leases and iii restrictions under certain covenants of the company s unsecured credit facility co led by bank one and lehman brothers holdings  inc debt capacity in november   the company increased to million its unsecured credit facility led by bank one

at december   the company s debt constituted approximately of its fully diluted total market capitalization 
also  the company s ebitda to debt service coverage ratio remained high at to  and the company s ebitda to fixed charge coverage ratio decreased to to due to preferred dividends 
the company s fully diluted common equity market capitalization was approximately million  and its fully diluted total market capitalization exceeded billion

in february   duff phelps credit rating co 
joined moody s investors service s january  evaluation by assigning investment grade rating to the company s senior unsecured debt and preferred stock issuable under the company s shelf registration statement and convertible subordinated notes 
also in  standard and poors assigned an investment grade rating to the company s senior unsecured debt

the net proceeds of the issuance of approximately million were used to pay down the company s line of credit 
the company has considered its short term one year or less capital needs  in conjunction with its estimated future cash flow from operations and other expected sources 
the company believes that its ability to fund operating expenses  building improvements  debt service requirements and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code  will be met by recurring operating and investment revenue and other real estate income 
long term greater than one year capital needs for property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major redevelopment projects  expansions  and construction of build to suit properties will be supported  initially  by draws on the company s unsecured line of credit  followed by the issuance of long term unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity securities 
management expects that a significant portion of the company s investment funds will be supplied by the proceeds of dispositions of stabilized assets  which is dependent on market conditions which presently remain favorable 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the leases are for remaining terms less than five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rental rates if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
year compliance the year problem resulted from the use of a two digit year date in programs that operate computers and other devices with computer components instead of a four digit date 
the programs with a year problem assumed in front of every two digit date 
for all dates beginning in the year  this two digit year assumption could incorrectly process critical financial and operational information or fail all together 
if not addressed  the year problem was expected to affect almost all companies  governmental agencies and organizations 
in response to the year problem  the company initiated a project in early to identify  evaluate and implement a new computerized real estate management system 
the company implemented a combination of modifications to existing programs and conversion to year compliant software 
in addition  the company discussed with its tenants  vendors  and other service providers the possibility of any interface difficulties relating to the year problem that could have affected the company 
as of the date of this report  the company and those it conducts business with did make modifications or conversions in a timely manner  and the year problem had no material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the total cost associated with the required modifications was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  liquidity and financial position  and was expensed as incurred
