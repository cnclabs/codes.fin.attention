item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is a washington corporation organized by daniel r 
baty and two other founders in in november  we held our initial public offering and began our expansion strategy 
until  we focused on rapidly expanding our operations in order to assemble a portfolio of assisted living communities with a critical mass of capacity 
we pursued an aggressive acquisition and development strategy during that time  acquiring and developing communities in  acquiring and developing communities in  and developing communities in having achieved our growth objective  in and continuing in we substantially reduced our pace of acquisition and our development activities to concentrate on enhancing operations and increasing occupancy  which had been a secondary focus during this period of rapid expansion 
our focus on operations and occupancy yielded a nine percentage point increase between both year end and  and year end and  to an ending occupancy of at december   across our consolidated portfolio 
average occupancy increased four percentage points between and and percentage points between and to for our total operated portfolio experienced a similar trend for ending occupancy increasing four percentage points to at december  compared to at december  we intend to continue our growth strategy by selectively acquiring and developing new communities with operating characteristics consistent with our current emphasis on maintaining high occupancy and enhancing our operating model and service offerings 
the following table presents a summary of our community interests 
as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units buildings units owned     leased     managed admin services 
  joint venture partnership operated portfolio     percentage increase pending acquisitions  new developments    minority interest alert   total     percentage increase decrease the percentage increase decrease indicates the change from the preceding december the six communities under development at december  are being developed by third parties  but will be managed by us upon completion 
in november  we sold all our minority interest in alert care 
included in our consolidated portfolio of communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or familial resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe generally that only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
inflation or other circumstances that adversely affect seniors ability to pay for assisted living services could therefore have an adverse effect on our business 
all sources of revenue other than residents private resources constitute less than of our total revenues 
we have incurred net operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities since our inception 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses resulted from a number of factors  including 
the development of and acquisition of assisted living communities that incurred operating losses during the to month period after acquisition or development  
occupancy levels at our communities that were lower for longer periods than we originally anticipated  
financing costs that we incurred as a result of multiple financing and refinancing transactions  
refinancing transactions that increased the levels of our debt and our related interest expense  and 
administrative and corporate expenses that we increased to facilitate our growth 
during  we decided to reduce acquisition and development activities and dispose of select communities that had been operating at a loss 
we believe that slowing our acquisition and development activities has enabled us to use our resources more efficiently and increase our focus on enhancing community operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain items of the company s consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change of the dollar amounts from year to year

other expense interest expense  net impairment of securities n a other  net extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt n a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle n a net loss comparison of the years ended december  and total operating revenues 
total operating revenues decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease 
at december  and at march   we transferred our interests in a total of owned and leased communities to others but continued to manage them under three year management agreements with rights of first refusal or options to acquire them in the future 
as a result  we now receive management fees from these communities rather than the revenues arising from their operations 
for  these communities were responsible for million in operating revenue while generating million in management fees for the same period in this decrease in revenue was partially offset  however  by generally increasing levels of occupancy throughout our consolidated communities 
average occupancy of the consolidated communities we own and lease for rose to compared to for the owned and leased communities in the equivalent period  an increase of percentage points 
community operations 
community operating expenses decreased million to million for from for  representing a decrease 
as a percentage of total operating revenues  community operations decreased to for compared to for this reduction is primarily the result of the transfer of of our previously leased and owned communities to management agreements  as discussed in total operating revenues above 
these communities were responsible for million of community operating expenses as owned and leased communities in  because and were managed communities during and the nine months ended december   respectively  we were no longer responsible for their operating expenses 
this decrease was partially offset  however  by increased variable costs resulting from the significant occupancy gains in our communities and by increased sales and marketing costs 
our community operating margin  which we compute as community revenues less community operating expenses  has increased to for compared to for this improvement is  in part  because the communities that we transferred to management agreements generally experienced lower margins than our communities as a whole and  in part  because of cost control measures that we instituted in that affected our remaining owned and leased communities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for compared to for the increase of general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues is due  in part  to the shift from community revenues to management fees in the transfer of the communities referred to above 
the overall increase of million is attributable to greater personnel costs to support our increasing number of communities as well as increased marketing costs to enhance occupancy 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for from million for  representing a increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to for as compared to for rent 
rent expense decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the transfer of of our previously leased operating communities to management agreements as discussed above 
these communities accounted for million in rent expense for we leased an average of communities in  compared to an average of in rent as a percentage of revenues was and for and  respectively 
interest expense  net of interest income 
interest expense  net of interest income nominally changed to million for from million for  representing an increase of less than one percent 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense increased to for as compared to for this increase is primarily the result of an increase in mortgage interest expense due to the refinancing of several properties during the change in percentage of revenue is primarily the result of our decrease in revenues from the transfer of of our communities as discussed above 
in addition  total debt increased approximately million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  impairment of investment securities 
impairment of investment securities was million for in  we wrote down our investment in arv as we concluded the decline in the fair market value of this investment was other than temporary 
other  net 
other  net decreased million to million for from million for  representing a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  other  net  decreased to in from in the million decrease results from the recognition of our portion of operating losses from two of our communities  gains realized on the sale of investment securities  and the disposition of communities in which did not occur in extraordinary item 
we recognized extraordinary losses of approximately  and  for and  respectively  resulting from the write off of loan fees and other related costs in conjunction with the refinancing of several of our mortgage financed communities 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in  we recognized the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million related to the early adoption of statement of position sop  reporting on costs of start up activities  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization be expensed as incurred 
comparison of years ended december  and total operating revenues 
total operating revenues increased million to million for  from million for  representing an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to increased occupancy throughout our communities 
occupancy at december  increased percentage points to compared to as of december  furthermore  average occupancy for was compared to for  an increase of percentage points 
in addition to the increase in occupancy  we opened five newly developed communities in  which accounted for a million increase in revenue 
community operating expenses 
community operating expenses increased million to million for from million for  representing an increase 
as a percentage of total revenues  community operations increased to for compared to for these increases were the result of increased labor costs due to the overall census increase throughout our communities  the opening of five newly developed communities during  increased sales and marketing costs  and the recording of start up and organization costs as operating expenses in accordance with sop  which would previously have been deferred and amortized 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased million to million for compared to million for  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  these costs have stayed relatively constant at for and the overall increase of million is primarily attributable to greater personnel costs due to our growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for from million for as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to for compared to for the decrease is the result of expensing previously deferred start up and organization costs in in accordance with sop rent 
rent expense increased million to million for from million for  representing an increase of 
this increase is primarily attributable to the opening of five newly developed communities in and in in addition  the increase is partly the result of lease provisions providing for additional payments based on a percentage of revenue in as a percentage of total revenue  rent expense decreased percentage points to for compared to for other 
in  we incurred million of charges related to the termination of our tender offer for another company and changes in our operating structure 
we did not have any similar charges in interest expense  net 
interest expense increased million to million for from million for  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense increased percentage points to for compared to for this increase is primarily the result of an increase in mortgage interest expense due to the refinancing of several properties during in addition  total debt increased approximately million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  other  net 
other  net increased million to million for from approximately  for  representing an increase of 
the increase is a result of gains realized on the sale of investment securities and the dispositions of communities 
extraordinary item 
we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately  for  representing the write off of loan fees and other related costs of our early extinguishment of debt when we refinanced communities 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in  we recognized the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million related to the early adoption of sop  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization be expensed as incurred 
during  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the early adoption of sop  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization be expensed as incurred 
we did not incur such a charge in same community comparison we operated communities on a comparable basis during both the three months ended december  and the following table sets forth a comparison of same community results of operations  excluding general and administrative expenses  for the three months ended december  and three months ended december dollar percent change change in thousands revenue    community operating expense    community operating income   depreciation and amortization   rent   operating income   interest expense  net   other expense  net net loss the same communities represented million or of our total operating revenue for the quarter ended december  same community revenues increased million or to million for the three months ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in this increase in revenue is the result of increased occupancy at the same communities and monthly rate increases due to an expanded range of services offered at the communities 
for the quarter ended december  occupancy increased to from for the quarter ended december  in addition  revenue per occupied unit increased to  for the quarter ended december  compared to  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended december   we generated operating income of million compared to an operating income of million for the comparable period in  an improvement of million or 
for the full years and  we operated communities on a comparable basis 
the following table sets forth a comparison of these same community results of operations  excluding general and administrative expenses for these two years 
year ended december  dollar percentage change change in thousands revenue    community operating expense    community operating income    depreciation and amortization    rent   operating income    interest expense  net   other income expense  net net loss    these same communities represented million or of our total operating revenue for same community revenues increased million or to million for compared to million for this increase in revenue is the result of increased occupancy for these same communities and monthly rate increases due to an expanded range of services offered at the communities 
for  occupancy increased percentage points to from for in addition  revenue per occupied unit increased to  for compared to  for for  we generated operating income of million and net income of million compared to operating income of million and a net loss of million for  an improvement of approximately million and more than for both figures 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the year ended december  for  net cash used in operating activities was million resulting primarily from our net loss of million 
we repurchased one of our previously leased facilities during the third quarter and incurred general property and equipment capital expenditures of million  as well as an excess of  of construction expenditures on leased communities over construction advances for the year 
these outflows of cash were offset by our march  transfer of leased communities for million as well as by proceeds on the sale of our office park of  in december  we obtained net proceeds of million from a preferred stock purchase by an investor group  of which million is restricted for future acquisitions 
as a result of this financing transaction  we increased our cash position at december  by a net of million thereby creating working capital of million 
in march  we disposed of leasehold interests in of our buildings in the meditrust restructuring transaction which produced net proceeds of million as indicated above 
in addition  this restructuring transaction has reduced our operating lease payments by a yearly amount of million 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock through public market transactions at an aggregate cost of million 
we have been and expect to continue to be dependent on third party financing for our cash needs in connection with operating losses as well as with our acquisition and development of communities 
there can be no assurance that financing for these requirements will be available to us on acceptable terms 
moreover  to the extent we acquire communities that do not generate positive cash flow  we may be required to seek additional capital or borrowings for working capital and liquidity purposes 
impact of yk we completed our year remediation plans by the end of  and have not experienced any significant disruptions to our financial or operating activities caused by failure of our computerized systems resulting from year issues 
further  we have no information that indicates a significant vendor or service provider has experienced any significant disruptions to their financial or operating activities such that they would be unable to provide us goods or services 
furthermore  we have not received any notification from lenders or regulatory agencies indicating that a lender considers or may consider us to be in violation of a loan agreement  or significant regulatory action is being or may be taken against us as a result of year issues 
impact of inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
it could  however  affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on our senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
as a result  our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short and long term borrowings 
we manage this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   our variable rate borrowings totaled million 
if market interest rates average more in than they did in  our interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december  and do not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment nor does it consider likely actions that management could take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
