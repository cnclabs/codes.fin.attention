item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations a significant portion of our revenue is derived from fixed price software development contracts and licenses 
we recognize this revenue on the estimated percentage of completion basis 
since the billing schedules under the contracts differ from the recognition of revenue  at the end of any period  these contacts generally result in either costs and estimated profits in excess of billing or billing in excess of cost and estimated profits 
during  we received contracts that are larger than in previous years and they provide for a longer time between milestone payments 
as a result  both our costs and estimated profits in excess of billings and our billings in excess of cost and estimated profits have increased at december  the largest component of our revenue is based upon the time spent by our technical personnel on a project 
as a result  during the third and fourth quarters  when many of our employees are on vacation and holidays  our revenue could be affected

furthermore  if we continue to grow at the existing rate into and beyond  we may require additional funding 
we are exploring various long term funding possibilities  although we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain financing  and our failure to obtain financing could impair our ability to grow 
an important part of our growth strategy is to acquire other businesses that are related to our current business 
such acquisitions may be made with cash or our securities or a combination of cash and securities 
to the extent that we require cash  we may have to borrow the funds or issue equity 
we have no commitments from any financing source and we may not be able to raise any cash necessary to complete an acquisition 
if we fail to make any acquisitions  our future growth may be limited 
as of the date of this form k annual report  we do not have any agreement or understanding  either formal or informal  as to any acquisition 
year compliance the year issue refers generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that is not year compliant may not be able to determine whether means or  which may result in computer and other failures or the creation of erroneous results 
we believe that our present software products are year compliant  and that any changes which may be required to software which we have delivered in the past would be made pursuant to new contracts with the clients to provide them with a current version of our products 
we have defined year compliant as the ability to correctly handle date information needed for the december  to january  date change  function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the advent of a new century  assuming correct configuration  where appropriate  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined and predetermined manner  if the date elements in interfaces and data storage specify the century  store and provide output of date information in ways that are unambiguous as to century  and recognize year as a leap year 
to date  we have not experienced any material expense relating to year compliance
