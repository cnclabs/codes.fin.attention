item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
overview jakks was founded to design  develop  produce and market children s toys and related products 
we commenced business operations when we assumed operating control over the toy business of justin products limited justin  and have included the results of justin s operations in our consolidated financial statements from july   the effective date of that acquisition 
the justin product lines  which consisted primarily of fashion dolls and accessories and electronic products for children  accounted for substantially all of our net sales for the period from april  inception to december  one of our key strategies has been to grow through the acquisition or licensing of product lines  concepts and characters 
in  we expanded our product lines to include products based on licensed characters and properties  such as world wrestling federation action figures and accessories 
we acquired road champs in february  and have included the results of operations of road champs from february   the effective date of the acquisition 
we acquired the child guidance and remco trademarks in october  both of which contributed to operations nominally in  but contributed more significantly to operations commencing in we acquired berk in june and have included the results of operations of berk since june  in october  we acquired flying colors toys 
the flying colors product lines contributed to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of our products currently include action figures and accessories featuring licensed characters  principally from the world wrestling federation  flying colors molded plastic activity sets  clay compound playsets and lunch boxes  wheels division products  including road champs die cast collectible and toy vehicles and remco toy vehicles and role play toys and accessories  child guidance infant and pre school electronic toys  toy foam puzzle mats and blocks  activity sets and outdoor products and fashion and mini dolls and related accessories 
in june  we formed a joint venture with thq  a developer  publisher and distributor of interactive entertainment software  and the joint venture licensed the rights from world wrestling federation entertainment to publish world wrestling federation electronic video games on all platforms 
the first games produced under this license were released in november we are entitled to receive a guaranteed preferred return  based on sales of the video games  and thq is entitled to receive the balance of the profits 
in general  we acquire products or product concepts from others or we engage unaffiliated third parties to develop our own products  thus minimizing operating costs 
royalties payable to our developers generally range from to of the wholesale price for each unit of a product sold by us 
we expect that outside inventors will continue to be a source of new products in the future 
we also generate internally new product concepts  for which we pay no royalties 
we contract the manufacture of most of our products to unaffiliated manufacturers located in china 
we sell the finished products on a letter of credit basis or on open account to our customers  who take title to the goods in hong kong 
these methods allow us to reduce certain operating costs and working capital requirements 
a portion of our sales  primarily sales of our road champs and flying colors products  originate in the united states  so we hold certain inventory in warehouse and fulfillment facilities operated by unaffiliated third parties 
in addition  we hold inventory of other products from time to time in support of promotions or other domestic programs with retailers 
to date  substantially all of our sales have been to domestic customers 
we intend to expand distribution of our products into foreign territories and  accordingly  we have engaged representatives to oversee sales in certain territories  engaged distributors in certain territories  and established direct relationships with retailers in certain territories 
we establish reserves for sales allowances  including promotional allowances and allowances for anticipated defective product returns  at the time of shipment 
the reserves are determined as a percentage of net sales based upon either historical experience or on estimates or programs agreed upon by our customers 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of goods produced for us by unaffiliated third party manufacturers  royalties earned by licensors on the sale of these goods and amortization of the tools  dies and molds owned by us that are used in the manufacturing process 
other costs include inbound freight and provisions for obsolescence 
significant factors affecting our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include the proportion of net sales generated by various products with disparate gross margins  the proportion of net sales made domestically  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales made in hong kong  and the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily amortization of tools  dies and molds  over varying levels of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process  such as sales commissions  advertising and travel expenses  as well as general corporate expenses  goodwill and trademark amortization and product development 
we have recorded goodwill of approximately million and trademarks of approximately million in connection with acquisitions made to date 
goodwill is being amortized over a year period  while trademark acquisition costs are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
results of operation the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales 
april  inception to december  years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations income from joint venture interest  net other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the significant growth in net sales was due primarily to the continuing growth of the world wrestling federation action figure product line with its expanded product offerings and frequent character releases  as well as to increasing sales in our wheels division  consisting primarily of our road champs die cast toy and collectible vehicles  fashion and holiday dolls and child guidance pre school toys and the addition of berk products  which contributed nominally to operations beginning in the third quarter of and flying colors products  which contributed moderately to operations beginning in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in the overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margin of of net sales was due in part to the changing product mix  which included products  such as world wrestling federation action figures and bxs die cast bicycles  with higher margins than some of our other products  and the amortization expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our products  which decreased on a percentage basis due to the fixed nature of these costs 
the higher margin resulting from lower product costs was offset in part by higher royalties 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in from million  or of net sales  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased nominally as a percentage of net sales due in part to increases in advertising expenses and product development costs of our various products in  which were offset in part by a decrease as a percentage of net sales due to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses in conjunction with the significant increase in net sales 
the overall dollar increase of million was due to the significant increase in net sales with their proportionate impact on variable selling costs  such as freight and shipping related expenses  sales commissions  cooperative advertising and travel expenses in addition to the costs added in connection with our acquisitions of flying colors and berk in we produced television commercials in support of several of our products  including world wrestling federation action figures  in and we may increase our advertising efforts  including the use of more expensive advertising media  such as television  if we deem it appropriate for particular products 
income from joint venture 
in  we began to earn our preferred return on the sale of world wrestling federation video games by our joint venture with thq 
interest  net 
we had significantly lower interest bearing obligations in than in with the conversion of our convertible debentures in in addition  we had significantly higher average cash balances during than in due to the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in may and in december other income expense 
in  we recorded a nominal amount of other income  while in  other expense resulted from the loss on the disposition of certain assets 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes included federal  state and foreign income taxes at effective tax rates of and in and  respectively  benefiting from a flat hong kong corporation tax on our income arising in  or derived from  hong kong 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately  for which no allowance has been provided since  in the opinion of management  realization of the future benefit is probable 
in making this determination  management considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the significant growth in net sales was due primarily to the continuing growth of the world wrestling federation action figure product line with its expanded product offerings and frequent character releases  as well as to the full year impact on sales of the remco toy vehicles and child guidance pre school toys which contributed only nominally in from their acquisition date in late october contributions made by sales of road champs die cast collectible and toy vehicles and our holiday doll line were comparable with the prior year  while our line of radio controlled vehicles made only nominal contributions to net sales in gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in the overall increase in gross profit was attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
the increase in the gross profit margin of of net sales was due in part to the changing product mix  which included products  such as world wrestling federation action figures  with higher margins than some of our other products 
the higher margin resulting from lower product costs was offset in part by higher royalties  and the amortization expense of molds and tools used in the manufacture of our products was comparable on a percentage basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in  from million  or of net sales  in the overall significant increase of million in these costs was due in large part to the full year impact of costs associated with our addition of infrastructure in the united states and hong kong in connection with the road champs acquisition  as well as to development and marketing costs of products under our recently acquired child guidance and remco trademarks and under existing products lines  such as the world wrestling federation action figures 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased modestly as a percentage of net sales due in part to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses  which were offset in part by increases in advertising expenses and product development costs in the overall dollar increase was also due to the significant increase in net sales with their proportionate impact on variable selling costs  such as freight and shipping related expenses  sales commissions  cooperative advertising and travel expenses 
we produced television commercials in support of several of our products  including world wrestling federation action figures in and  as well as radio controlled vehicles in from time to time  we may increase our advertising efforts  including the use of more expensive advertising media  such as television  if we deem it appropriate for particular products 
interest  net 
we had comparable interest bearing obligations in and in with our convertible debentures and seller notes issued in connection with the child guidance remco and road champs acquisitions 
in addition  we had comparable average cash balances during and provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes included federal  state and foreign income taxes in and also included a tax benefit generated by operating losses for federal and state purposes in our earnings were subject to effective tax rates of and in and  respectively  benefiting from a flat hong kong corporation tax on our income arising in  or derived from  hong kong 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of  and  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
the carry forwards were fully utilized in as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately  for which no allowance has been provided since  in the opinion of management  realization of the future benefit is probable 
in making this determination  management considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  as well as the weight and importance given to such evidence 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry 
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results for the years indicated 
the seasonality of our business is reflected in this quarterly presentation

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
operating activities provided net cash of million in as compared to million in net cash was used primarily for the purchase of marketable securities and increases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset in part by net income  non cash charges  such as depreciation  amortization and recognition of compensation expense for options  and increases in operating liabilities 
our investing activities used net cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in  consisting primarily of the purchase of molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products in and and goodwill acquired in the acquisitions of flying colors and berk in as part of our strategy to develop and market new products  we have entered into various character and product licenses with royalties ranging from to payable on net sales of such products 
as of december   these agreements required future aggregate minimum guarantees of million  exclusive of million in advances already paid 
our investing activities used net cash of million in  as compared to million in  consisting primarily of the purchase of molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products  the initial funding of the world wrestling federation joint venture in  trademarks purchased in connection with the acquisitions of road champs and the child guidance and remco brands  and goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of road champs in our financing activities provided net cash of million in the year ended december   consisting primarily of the issuance of our common stock in our public offerings in may and december and the exercises of options and warrants  partially offset by dividends paid to holders of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million  consisting primarily of the issuance of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock partially offset by the repayment of various notes and other debt issued in connection with our acquisitions in our financing activities provided net cash of million in  consisting primarily of the issuance of  shares of our preferred stock at a price of  per share in a private placement to two investors  partially offset by the repayment of various debt issued in connection with the road champs and child guidance remco trademarks acquisitions 
in  financing activities provided net cash of million  consisting of the issuance of our redeemable convertible preferred stock in october  which provided million  net of offering costs  the placement of our convertible debentures in january  which provided million  net of offering costs  and various notes and other debt issued in connection with our acquisitions in  less approximately million in debt repaid 
in january  we received proceeds  net of issuance costs  of approximately million from the issuance of million in convertible debentures  which were converted in march and april into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
these debentures bore interest at per annum  payable monthly  and were due in december in february  we acquired road champs for approximately million 
consideration paid at closing was approximately million in cash plus the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and the assumption of approximately  of liabilities 
the balance of the cash consideration million was paid during the twelve month period ended in february assets included in the purchase were molds and tooling  office and warehouse equipment and other operating assets  as well as license agreements  trade name and goodwill 
in october  we acquired the child guidance and remco trademarks for approximately million 
consideration paid at closing was million in cash plus the issuance of a note payable in the amount of million  which was paid in five quarterly installments ended december  in addition  we incurred legal and accounting fees of approximately  and assumed liabilities of million 
the acquisition was funded in part by the issuance of shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock  which were converted into  shares of our common stock in march also in connection with this acquisition  we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement whereby the seller of the trademarks will provide the tools and other manufacturing resources for the production of products under the trademarks 
that agreement provides for four quarterly payments of  followed by six quarterly payments of  which payments commenced on december  and are to be completed on march  in october  we entered into a credit facility agreement with norwest bank minnesota  na which provides our hong kong subsidiaries with a working capital line of credit and letters of credit for the purchase of products and the operation of those subsidiaries 
the facility expired on may  in april  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock to two investors in a private placement  which were converted into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the use of proceeds was for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in may  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
we used substantially all of these proceeds to fund our acquisition of flying colors toys 
in december  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
these proceeds  which we invested temporarily in marketable securities and cash equivalents  are expected to be applied to our product acquisition  development  working capital and general corporate needs 
in june  we purchased all the outstanding capital stock of berk for approximately million 
we also agreed to pay an earn out of up to  if sales of berk products achieve certain prescribed levels over the month period ending june  berk is a leading producer of educational toy foam puzzle mats and blocks featuring popular licensed characters  including mickey mouse  minnie mouse  winnie the pooh  blue s clues  barney  teletubbies  sesame street  looney tunes and toy story characters  and non licensed activity sets and outdoor products 
on october   we completed the acquisition of the flying colors product line through the purchase of all the outstanding capital stock of flying colors toys  a privately held company based in dexter  michigan 
at or shortly after the closing we paid approximately million for the stock and paid off approximately million of indebtedness 
we also agreed to pay an earn out of up to million over the month period following the closing if net sales of flying colors products achieve certain targeted levels during this period 
two of flying colors toys senior executives and most of its creative design and product development staff have remained with flying colors toys 
flying colors toys principal products include molded plastic activity kits  clay compound playsets and lunch boxes featuring licensed characters  including barbie  rugrats  blue s clues and looney tunes characters 
the kits cover a broad range of products and activities  such as make and paint your own characters  jewelry making  art studios  posters  puzzles and other projects 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
impact of the year assessment of internal infrastructure 
we believe that we have identified most of the major computers  software applications and related equipment used in connection with our internal operations that need to be evaluated to determine if they must be modified  upgraded or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to our business 
based on a review of these computer systems  we have determined that our computer systems and applications are compliant with the year format 
since january   we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems or applications related to the year problem 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  telephone switches  security systems and other common devices  may be affected by the year problem 
we have assessed the potential effect of the year problem on our office and facilities equipment and have determined that no problems exist that cannot be remediated by the replacement of relatively inexpensive equipment 
since january   we have not experienced any problems with our office and facilities equipment related to the year problem 
costs of remediation 
our total cost of completing required modifications  upgrades or replacements of our internal systems was approximately  based on the activities described above  we do not believe that the year problem will have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
suppliers 
as part of our review of the year problem  we contacted third party suppliers of components and key contractors used in the production of our products to identify and  to the extent possible  resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  we have limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers and subcontractors 
thus  while we believe that we have resolved any significant year problems with these third parties  there can be no assurance that these suppliers have resolved any or all year problems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the operation of our business 
any failure on the part of these third parties to timely resolve year problems with their systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
since january   we have not experienced any disruption in our business or operations resulting from any year problems of any of our third party suppliers or contractors 
most likely consequences of year problems 
we believe that we have identified and resolved all year problems that could materially adversely affect our business operations 
since january   we have not experienced any year problems that have affected our business and operations 
however  we believe that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting us have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices and systems that could be affected and the interactions among these devices and systems are too numerous to address 
in addition  we cannot accurately predict whether failures will occur as a result of the year problem or the severity  timing  duration or financial consequences of these potential failures 
as a result  we believe it is possible that a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for us  our contract manufacturers and our customers that will divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from ordinary business activities 
contingency plans 
we have developed contingency plans to be implemented if our efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting our internal systems are not effective 
depending on the systems affected  these plans include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup equipment or software or other redundant systems  increased work hours for our personnel or the hiring of additional information technology staff  and the use of contract personnel to correct  on an accelerated basis  any year problems that arise or to provide interim alternative solutions for information system deficiencies 
our implementation of any of these strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other factors 
the discussion of our efforts and expectations relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
our ability to achieve year compliance  and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the availability and cost of contract personnel and external resources  third party suppliers ability to modify proprietary software and unanticipated problems not identified in the ongoing compliance review 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have any bank loan or other credit facility  nor do we have any outstanding debt securities  and  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong 
sales from these operations are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
