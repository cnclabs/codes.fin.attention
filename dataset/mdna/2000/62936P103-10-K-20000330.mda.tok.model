item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs 
to date  we have not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale 
we have incurred cumulative losses through december  of million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our research and development activities and our testing activities in the laboratory  in animals and in humans 
substantially all our revenues come from license fees  milestone payments  and research and development support payments from licensees  these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  we expect that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  that the fluctuations may be substantial  and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results 
profitability will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensees  to complete product development  to obtain the required regulatory approvals  and to manufacture and market products 
we cannot assure that these events will occur 
results of operations all of our revenues of million in  million in  and million in  were derived from research and license agreements 
we recognized revenue from these agreements as follows under our agreement with smithkline beecham we recognized million in  million in  and million in  under our agreement with kirin we recognized million in each of and and million in  and under our agreement with amgen we recognized  in each of  and the higher revenue in resulted from a one time milestone payment of million from kirin 
these historical amounts are not indicative of future revenue that we may earn under these agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in after an increase from million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was principally due to the commencement of phase i clinical trials for nps in the third quarter of the decrease in research and development expenses from to was principally due to the completion of the clinical trials for nps in mid we expect development expenses to increase dramatically in as we conduct phase iii clinical trials for alx and phase ii clinical trials for alx we may incur additional research and development expenses if we start other clinical trials or if we acquire new technologies  product candidates or companies 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future in order to support operations in canada and the us and pre launch marketing costs incurred for product candidates 
we recorded a one time expense of million in for in process research and development acquired as part of the purchase of allelix 
we used an independent valuation of allelix to value the acquired in process research and development projects 
we assigned a fair value to purchased in process research and development by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products and discounting the resulting net cash flows related to these projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility fda approval and had no alternative future uses 
in developing these cash flow projections  we forecasted revenues for each project based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by allelix and its competitors 
the projected revenues are dependent upon successful introduction of products from the in process research and development projects 
in determining the operating cash flows related exclusively to each in process research and development project  we considered the contribution of both developed technology and core technology leveraged by the in process project 
because allelix did not have any products that had achieved technological feasibility as of the valuation date  we assigned no value to developed technology for allocation purposes 
the value of the core technology leveraged by the in process projects was captured in the valuation of the patent portfolio  consequently  we assigned no value for allocation purposes to core technology leveraged by the in process projects 
considering both project costs and technological progress for each project  we employed percentage of completion assumptions to reduce the projected revenue streams for the incomplete portion of each project as of the valuation date 
we forecasted operating expenses and resulting profit margins were based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process research and development 
we applied a tax rate of percent and appropriate adjustments were made to operating income to derive net cash flow for each project 
the revenues earned by the in process research and development products represent the return on all of the assets acquired under the agreement 
the cash flows generated by the new products must provide a return on each asset purchased that is consistent with the value and the relative risk of the asset 
to separately value in process research and development  we determined the value and required rate of return for other identifiable assets 
we deducted the required return on these other contributory assets from the cash flows generated by the projects in the in process research and development model to determine the incremental net cash flows specifically attributable to the completed portion of the in process research and development projects 
the discount rate applied to the net estimated cash flow for each in process research and development project was based on each project s state of development  complexity  and the market risk for the resulting product 
we applied discount rates of to percent to the in process research and development projects 
we valued the remaining intangible assets acquired from allelix at million after the write off of in process research and development 
this amount includes goodwill  assembled work force  and patents which are being amortized using the straight line basis over lives ranging from two to six years 
we did not incur any amortization of acquired intangibles in interest income was million in  million in  and million in the decreases in and were primarily due to decreases in the average balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities as cash was utilized for operations 
on february   we signed definitive agreements for the private placement of million shares of our common stock with expected net proceeds to us of approximately million upon closing of the transaction 
we expect that interest income will be higher in due to a higher average cash balance resulting from this offering 
however  we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations 
as of december   we had a us federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a us federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
we also had a canadian federal income tax investment credit carryforward of approximately million  and a canadian federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million and a canadian net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize the us operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities which totaled million at december  in addition  the net proceeds of the private placement agreements signed in february are expected to provide approximately million in cash to us 
we receive quarterly research and or development support payments under our agreements with amgen  kirin  and smithkline beecham and from janssen and eli lilly canada under agreements acquired as part of the allelix transaction 
all of the research and or development support payments under these agreements are scheduled to expire in we do not receive any research and development support payments under our agreement with abbott laboratories 
we could receive future payments of up to million in the aggregate upon the accomplishment of specified research and or development milestones under the several agreements 
all of the agreements provide for future royalties to be paid to us from the sale of products derived from these license agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing  or resources applied by our licensees under the several development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone payments and royalties from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee 
we cannot assure that our licensees will make any future payments  whether as research or development support payments  milestone payments or royalty payments 
we have an agreement with technology partnerships canada tpc  a program of the canadian government  which provides for tpc to reimburse us for research expenses incurred pursuing treatments for various intestinal disorders utilizing specified technology the alx technology 
tpc is bound to reimburse us for of the qualified costs incurred through december up to a maximum of cdn million 
we will pay a royalty to tpc on revenues received by us through december  from the sale or license of any product developed from the funded research 
if such payments have not reached a total of cdn million by that date  then royalty payments shall continue until that amount is reached or until december  whichever occurs first 
if tpc declares an event of default by us under the agreement  we could be required to repay all amounts received from tpc  plus interest and other damages 
as of december   no event of default had occurred 
we have entered into joint venture agreements and sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to purchase services from the joint ventures and to make research support payments to academic and or commercial research institutions 
as of december   we had a total commitment of approximately million for future joint venture services and research support payments 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the research institutions  or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
we expect that our existing capital resources  including interest earned thereon  and expected research and development support payments  milestone payments and the proceeds of the private placement agreements signed in february will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least months 
however  actual needs are dependent on numerous factors  especially with regard to the clinical trial and pre launch marketing and production costs for alx furthermore  in the event we in license or otherwise acquire other technologies  product candidates or companies  substantial expenditures may be required 
in addition  if any licensee terminates its agreement  we might not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product arising from the technology returned to us under the then terminated agreement 
a reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or milestone payments may shorten the period during which we could maintain our operations or require us to reduce operations  or both 
it may also become necessary to raise additional funds to support our development and commercialization programs 
we are presently seeking additional funding for certain current programs through corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financing which could be dilutive to current shareholders 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may modify plans for some of our research and development programs 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
in sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we must adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
on december   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we will incorporate the guidance of sab in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet determined the impact that sab will have on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  and maximize yields 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types  and maturities  which consist mainly of fixed rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
after a review of our marketable securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
a portion of our research and development operations are in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in canada to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
