to date the foreign currency rate changes have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
this is because approximately of the company s sales are made by foreign subsidiaries and independent currency fluctuations tend to minimize the translation effect of any individual currency exchange fluctuations  and the effect of individual rate changes on sales and expenses tend to offset each other 
additionally  the company hedges its foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to its foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts
