revenues the company s contract placement revenues are derived from professional service activities  primarily the placement of skilled it  engineering and professional personnel whose work is billed at an hourly rate 
an engagement of the company s technical consultants typically lasts from six to months 
revenues are directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates

for the year ended december   total hours billed were  with an average billing rate of  compared to total hours billed of  with an average billing rate of for the prior year period 
the company believes that the increase in the average billing rates for its technical consultants has resulted from an increased demand for skilled and experienced technical consultants and to its intentional focus on making higher level it placements 
cost of sales in the contract placement business consists primarily of the compensation expenses related to the consultants  such as salaries  fringe benefits and payroll taxes

the company frequently conducts its courses at the in house facilities of its corporate clients and has the ability to provide the necessary computer equipment at conference centers  hotels and other off site locations as requested by its clients 
business strategy the company s business objectives are to increase market share in existing markets by offering additional services  such as its regional website for on line recruiting and job posting  to increase cross selling opportunities by offering all of its services in each location  and to continue to strengthen its market position  by expansion through internal growth 
the company continues to pursue cost controls originally put in place in  by reevaluating its current operating practices to find ways to improve the productivity of its personnel 
in the company continued a focused strategic planning and budgeting process resulting in a internal operating plan that attempts to increase revenues approximately  while controlling costs  and returns the company to profitability 
however  this plan is subject to many factors and contingencies  and the company may not be able to realize this goal 
a part of the increase in revenues includes a planned expansion of the sales and recruiting staffs 
the internal operating plan more closely ties management s compensation to its ability to meet revenue and profit goals 
if the company is able to achieve its internal operating plan  which relies upon certain assumptions including  but not limited to  its ability to increase sales and recruiting staffs in the contract placement and permanent placement businesses  and to maintain strict cost controls in all of its operating units  the company believes it can achieve earnings before interest and taxes of approximately of its revenues

in addition  as companies approached the yk turnover they postponed some non yk projects  which was reflected in decreased revenues for the third and fourth quarters of above

when used in sec filings  and in oral statements by the company the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions as they relate to the company or the company s management  identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to the company s operations and results of operations  competitive factors and pricing pressures  shifts in market demand  the performance and needs of the industries served by the company  and other risks and uncertainties  including  in addition to any uncertainties specifically identified in the text surrounding such statements and those identified below  uncertainties with respect to changes or developments in social  economic  business  industry  market  legal and regulatory circumstances and conditions and actions taken or omitted to be taken by third parties  including the company s shareholders  customers  suppliers  business partners  competitors  and legislative  regulatory  judicial and other governmental authorities and officials 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated  believed  estimated  expected  intended or planned 
dependence on availability of qualified technical consultants 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain technical consultants who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of its clients 
to keep pace with rapidly evolving information technologies and changing client needs  the company must continually evaluate and upgrade its database of available qualified technical consultants 
competition for individuals with proven technical skills is intense  and  as is currently customary in the industry  the company does not have any exclusive contracts with its consultants 
the company competes for such individuals with other providers of technical staffing services  systems integrators  providers of outsourcing services  computer systems consultants  clients and temporary personnel agencies 
factors influencing such competition include compensation  benefits  growth opportunities and pre existing relationships with other companies  particularly specialty staffing companies 
as the company expands into new geographic areas  it may experience difficulty attracting qualified technical consultants who have a prior relationship or familiarity with more established specialty staffing companies in such areas 
there can be no assurance that qualified technical consultants will continue to be available to the company in sufficient numbers to meet the company s current and anticipated growth requirements 
acquisition risks 
the company from time to time evaluates the possible acquisition of companies that will complement and expand the company s existing businesses  principally in new geographic markets 
the successful implementation of this strategy is dependent on the company s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire such companies on suitable terms and integrate their operations with those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that  if identified  the company will be able to acquire such companies on suitable terms 
the specialty staffing industry is relatively mature 
acquisitions in this industry are therefore likely to be at higher relative prices than for other industries due to competition from other staffing companies for acquisition candidates 
acquisitions also involve a number of special risks  including i adverse effects on the company s reported operating results  including increased goodwill amortization and interest expense  ii diversion of management attention  iii risks associated with unanticipated problems  liabilities or contingencies  iv difficulties and higher than expected costs related to the integration of the acquired business  and v dilution of existing shareholders 
the occurrence of some or all of the events described in these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ability to manage growth 
sustained or significant growth  if achieved  will subject the company to risks by placing a substantial strain on the company s available managerial  sales  recruiting  financial and other resources 
specifically  such growth will require the company to i hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing markets as well as markets in which the company has no prior operating experience  ii develop and maintain relationships with an increasingly large number of highly qualified technical consultants  iii maintain cost controls in all of the company s businesses  and iv apply its management practices to a significantly larger organization 
expansion beyond the geographic areas where the company s offices are presently located will further increase demands on the company s management 
the company s ability to manage its staff and facilities growth effectively will require it to continue to expand its operational  financial and other internal systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be successfully implemented or adequate to support the company s expanded operations 
furthermore  an element of the company s business strategy is to cross sell the existing services of its businesses to new and existing clients 
historically  these businesses have operated independently  producing only occasional referrals  and there can be no assurance that the company will successfully market such services on an integrated basis 
in addition  if the technology sector of the economy experiences a downturn  the company could be affected more so than other businesses 
dependence on contract placement business 
the company s contract placement business was responsible for  and of total company revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  for the year ended  one customer of the contract placement business  merck company  inc  accounted for approximately of total contract placement revenues  and of total company revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain this level of revenue from this client 
the ability of the company to sustain or increase revenues in the contract placement business is subject to various factors  including its ability to attract and retain qualified technical consultants  to hire  integrate and retain qualified managers  recruiters and sales personnel in existing and new markets  to apply its management practices to a significantly larger organization and to consummate acquisitions of and to successfully integrate profitable staffing companies 
the inability of the company to successfully manage these factors would have a material adverse effect on the revenues of the contract placement business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase its contract placement revenues 
furthermore  a decline in the level of contract placement revenues would have a material adverse effect on the company
