item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations 
overview the general financial condition and results of operations for kvh industries  inc  which will be addressed in this discussion will include information about o factors that affect our business  o what our earnings and costs were in and  o why those earnings and costs were different from the years before  o where our income came from  o how all these factors affected our overall financial condition  o what we spent for capital projects from through  and o how we will pay for future operations 
as you read management s discussion and analysis  it may help to refer to our consolidated statements of operations on page  which presents the results of our operations for  and during the time period covered by this discussion  we have undergone a number of significant changes 
these changes have resulted in notable variances in our revenues  expenses  debt and total assets 
in reading this discussion  please keep certain events in mind o since  we have been targeting the communications and military navigation industries  where there are significant market opportunities 
this shift from our previous emphasis on the marine navigation industry  with its many competitors and low margins  has been a time consuming and costly process 
o an important step in our new strategy  acquiring a fiber optic sensor technology and the experienced staff to support and advance it  has required a substantial investment of funds to date 
we derive revenues from sensor products and systems sold to a range of commercial  military and oem markets in the communications and navigation industries 
our products include o stabilized antenna systems for mobile satellite applications such as voice  fax and data transmission and televisionreception  o positional and heading systems for tactical military applications in amphibious and land vehicles and for commercial applications in land vehicles  o digital compasses and instrument systems for recreational  commercial and military applications  and o embedded fiber optic sensors 
our in house sales and marketing groups have established a worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors to market the company s products 
the majority of sales  product distribution and customer service is conducted at our headquarters in middletown  rhode island  and the european market is managed through our subsidiary in hoersholm  denmark 
the manufacturing process consists primarily of light assembly and final test  which is conducted at our facilities in middletown  rhode island  and tinley park  illinois 
during  we had an increase in communications sales of more than percent  primarily due to the new land mobile satellite system we launched in february 
this entry into a new market also was our most successful product launch ever  and sales exceeded company expectations 
initial sales have been primarily to owners  manufacturers and distributors of rvs and luxury motor coaches 
rv and motor coaches together represent a potential market for us of some million existing vehicles and more than  new vehicles each year  and statistics and reports compiled by industry analysts indicate that this market will see considerable growth over the next years 
continued growth in sales of marine mobile satellite systems during also contributed to the increase in communications revenues 
our navigation sales were down during primarily because military orders decreased 
the military sales decline was principally due to longer sales cycles than originally anticipated for projects that were awarded to us  and as a result sales did not meet our expectations for the year 
at the same time  the increasing pressure within branches of the united states military during to create new  more mobile forces was a strong validation of our product strategy for this market 
transforming military forces from a conventional  open terrain threat to something more adaptable to the varied international crises that currently occur requires the consistent  highly accurate navigation capabilities that we believe is designed into our tactical navigation systems 
worldwide  the market for military retrofits and new installations of tactical navigation products is enormous and we are aggressively pursuing customers in many countries 
also during  integration of our tactical navigation systems and fiber optic gyros fogs advanced and we began taking orders for this new addition to our product line 
we also sell fiber optic sensors to oem customers  and in we strengthened our sales efforts in this area 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  net sales gross profit research and development sales and marketing general and administrative operating loss profit other expense income  net loss income before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense net loss income years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million from million in  primarily due to strong communications sales that offset lower than expected navigation sales 
product sales were million in and million in with respective customer funded research of million and million 
communications revenues increased in to million from million in as strong sales of mobile television satellite systems for our new market in land vehicles exceeded expectations and our marine mobile satellite systems continued to sell well 
navigation revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of more than that is attributable to unanticipated declines in high margin military sales 
while we were selected for a number of high margin military products  revenues were lower than anticipated due to longer timeframes for completing contracts than we had expected 
navigation products incorporating fiber optic sensors in decreased to million from million in  reflecting the discontinuance of bus navigation products in late the bus navigation product was a legacy product acquired through acquisition 
the decision to withdraw the bus navigation product from the marketplace was based on excessively high post sales support costs that made the economics of this product unfeasible 
our acquisition of fiber optic technology in was driven by our need to incorporate more accurate sensors into our existing product offerings 
the process of integrating fog technology has taken longer than anticipated  however  we received our first order for a tactical navigation system with an integrated fiber optic sensor in and anticipate sales in this product area will grow rapidly 
cost of goods sold 
the company s cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  material and indirect manufacturing costs 
customer funded research and development costs of million in and million in are also included as costs of sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased in to from in due to two opposing factors 
the positive impact of decreases in labor and material costs were offset by increases in manufacturing overheads  netting out to positive savings 
manufacturing overheads increased to million in from million in due to costs associated with initiating and scaling up production of new products and the under utilization of the tinley park manufacturing facility 
fixed manufacturing overheads at our tinley park facility were not offset by production volumes 
in  we completed the integration of fiber optic technology into our navigation products and received our first orders for these enhanced products 
based upon the market acceptance of our fiber optic enhanced sensor products  we anticipate that sales volumes will be sufficient to offset manufacturing costs of the tinley park facility 
looking ahead  we believe our production cost trends will continue in a positive direction 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of direct labor and material  associated overheads and other direct costs associated with the company s internally funded product development 
all software development costs are expensed in the period incurred 
internally funded research costs increased slightly to million in from million in we directed most of our research funds in to developing the new land mobile satellite television system and to integrating fiber optic sensor technology into our tactical navigation products 
we continued to increase internal funding of product development  which allowed us to better focus our research and decrease the amount of time required to bring a new product to market in total research and development expenditures  including customer funded product development expenditures included in cost of goods sold  were million in and million in we anticipate that customer funding of research and development will increase in  which will take some of the pressure off our capital resources by reducing overall research and development costs 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel expenses  cooperative advertising  sales literature  advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing costs grew more than to million in from million in major factors contributing to the growth of sales expenses were independent sales representative commissions  staffing  travel and new product introduction costs 
we expect sales and marketing expense will continue to grow as we introduce new products 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs attributable to the company s management  finance  accounting and human resources operations and legal and other professional services 
we decreased costs slightly to million in from million in by improving cost controls 
interest income 
interest income reflects the interest earned by investin excess cash in federal short term obligations 
interest expense 
mortgage costs and certain costs associated with leases are included in interest expense 
we anticipate significant increase in interest expense 
gain on foreign currency translation 
the results of operations of the company s foreign subsidiary  kvh europe  are determined by re measuring its foreign currency denominated operations as if they had taken place in united states dollars 
gains and losses resulting from this translation are included in the company s net income 
the translation gain decrease to 
million from million reflects changes in the strength of the united states dollar relative to the danish krone 
income tax benefit expense 
due to losses in both and  we realized a deferred income tax benefit of million and a current income tax benefit of million  respectively 
our effective tax rate in decreased by approximately to from in the decrease reflects a write down of deferred tax assets related to research tax credits taken from to we have taken this position based upon preliminary discussions with the internal revenue service  which is currently engaged in reviewing our tax returns filed in those years 
based upon our interpretation of the research tax credit provision  we believe the tax provision includes amounts that are sufficient to offset any exposure we may have for the years under examination 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in product sales were million in and million in with customer funded research of in both years 
navigation sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decline in high margin military sales 
communications sales increased to million in from million in as direct sales began replacing large non recurring oem sales 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes customer funded research and development costs of million in and million in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in due to a proportional decrease in higher margin military product sales 
manufacturing overheads increased to million in from million in as we moved the fiber optic group from the former andrew corporation site to a new facility in tinley park  illinois 
excluding fiber optic facility and manufacturing costs of million  overhead would have decreased percent in from research and development expense 
research costs increased to million in from million in due to costs for developing new directional antenna systems and million for fiber optic sensor integration and development 
internally funded product development accounted for million of the increase while fiber optic start up costs accounted for the remainder 
total research and development expenditures  including customer funded product development expenditures included in cost of goods sold  were million in and million in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing costs grew to million in from million in major factors contributing to the growth of sales expenses were staffing  travel and new product introduction costs 
general and administrative expense 
administrative costs increased to million in from million in due to staffing and increased professional fees related to maintaining our patent portfolio 
interest income 
interest income reflects the interest earned by investing excess cash in federal short term obligations 
gain loss on foreign currency translation 
the translation gain increase to million in from million in reflects changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar in relation to the danish krone 
income tax expense 
we realized an income tax benefit of million in compared to an expense of million in due to our operating loss 
our effective tax rate in both years was positively affected by utilizing state and federal research and development and investment tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  change change in thousands cash and cash equivalents    working capital    through the use of existing cash balances and mortgage financing  we financed approximately million in for the combined costs of operations and fixed asset acquisitions 
in january  we borrowed approximately million by mortgaging our facility at enterprise center  middletown  rhode island see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
looking ahead we anticipate that our operating costs will decrease in proportion to our sales volumes  generating positive cash from operations 
we believe that fixed manufacturing overhead spending will decline as a percent of revenues and we plan to reduce research and development costs by offsetting these costs with customer funding 
on march  we entered into a million asset based  three year  revolving loan facility at an interest rate of the prime bank lending rate plus 
any unused portion of the revolving credit facility accrues interest at an annual rate of basis points 
the loan facility provides for advancing funds based upon an asset availability formula that includes our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the availability formula sets aside a fixed amount of qualified assets that may not be borrowed against 
the company may terminate the loan prior to the full term  however  we would become liable for certain termination fees 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that existing cash balances and funds available under our new revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements for if we decide to expand more rapidly  to broaden or enhance products more rapidly  to acquire businesses or technologies or to make other significant expenditures to remain competitive  then we may need to raise additional funds 
other matters recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 

the statement amends sfas no 
to defer its effective date to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet completed our analysis of the impact of adopting sfas no 
on the financial statements  however  it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
year after evaluating the impact of the year issue as it relates to our navigation and communications products  we have concluded that they are not affected by year operating issues 
we also assessed our software and computer systems to be sure they are year compliant 
based on usage to date  our systems are year compliant 
inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
forward looking statements risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our previous statements 
o our products target two industries that are subject to volatility  risks and uncertainties 
the communications industry is experiencing rapid growth fueled by strong worldwide demand and buffeted by competing formats and rapid  unpredictable technology changes 
the defense industry historically experiences variability in supply and demand related to international conditions  national politics  budget decisions and technology changes  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict 
factors in both industries could affect our ability to effectively meet prevailing market conditions 
to position kvh in these uncertain industries  we have acquired fiber optic technology and developed related new products  redesigned and reduced product costs  and improved operational efficiencies 
o our future sales growth will depend to a considerable extent upon the successful introduction of new mobile satellite communications products for use in marine and land applications 
our success depends heavily on us rapidly completing product development that results in marketable products  particularly for worldwide internet and data applications 
success in this industry also requires satellite broadband capabilities that may not be available until or later and depends on other external variables that could adversely affect us satellite launches and new technology are expensive and experience some failures  and poor consumer confidence and or economic conditions could depress product demand 
o we also need to increase military sales over levels to achieve overall profitability 
issues that can affect our success in the military navigation industry include funding  equipment and performance criteria are continually evolving  we are introducing new technological solutions such as fogs that must be proven and then accepted  politics play a strong role in how products are selected  and sales cycles are long and difficult to predict 
o a large portion of our product development strategy for the near future relies upon fogs 
expenses for fog operations continue to add significant costs to operations 
as we continue the process of integrating fog sensors into current product offerings and pursuing oem markets for existing fog products  we expect fog related costs to increase 
our success with fiber optic products depends on our ability to continue funding fog development and marketing efforts  and progress in increasing manufacturing capabilities 
o major competitors pose risks throughout our target markets sea tel corporation manufactures and markets a broad line of marine satellite communications and satellite tracking equipment  including antenna systems for inmarsat and dbs tv applications 
for large dish marine satellite systems  sea tel has greater marketing experience than the company 
datron corporation provides a stabilized antenna design for rv and marine reception of dbs tv that competes with the company s turnkey dbs products 
hand held worldwide satellite voice  data and fax services provided by companies such as iridium world communications  ltd  globalstar telecommunications ltd 
and ico global communications could compete with our phone systems  although we believe there are mobile applications where our antennas will be required 
fibersense manufactures fiber optic gyros that compete in price and performance with our fog products 
o our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon all the foregoing risk factors and how successful we are in improving our ratios of revenues to expenses 
o the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations  and this could continue due to variations in operating results  development failures of our communications  navigation or fog products  and stock market volatility caused by industry events
