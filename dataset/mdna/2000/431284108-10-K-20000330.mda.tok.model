liquidity and capital resources statement of cash flows 
for the year ended december   the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities and million from investing activities primarily as a result of the dispositions of assets  offset in part by additions to real estate assets 
these combined cash flows of million were used to fund financing activities of million  primarily consisting of repayments on our million unsecured revolving loan the revolving loan and mortgages and notes payable as well as the payment of distributions during capitalization 
the company s total indebtedness at december  totaled billion and was comprised of million of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of and billion of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
except as stated below  all of the mortgage and notes payable outstanding at december  were either fixed rate obligations or variable rate obligations covered by interest rate hedge contracts 
a portion of our revolving loan and approximately million of floating rate notes payable assumed upon consummation of the merger with jc nichols were not covered by interest rate hedge contracts on december  based on the company s total market capitalization of billion at december  at the december  stock price of and assuming the redemption for shares of common stock of the million common units of minority interest in the operating partnership  the company s debt represented approximately of its total market capitalization 
we completed the following financing activities during o june equity settlement 
on june   we settled our august forward equity transaction with ubs ag  london branch through a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
in connection with the settlement   shares of the company s common stock were returned and retired 
o july debt retirement 
on july   we retired a million mortgage note that was secured by of our properties held by ap southeast portfolio partners  lp  one of our subsidiaries  by using million of availability under our revolving loan to repay the principal amount of the mortgage note plus the required yield maintenance premium for early maturity 
o october debt borrowing 
on october   we borrowed million from monumental life insurance company  an affiliate of aegon usa realty advisors  inc  pursuant to one million mortgage note due and one million mortgage note due  which notes are secured by of our properties 
we used the net proceeds from these mortgage loans  together with million that we received from counterparties to settle two treasury lock agreements in september  to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving loan 
o december credit facility amendment 
on december   we and our lenders amended our revolving loan to  among other things  reduce the overall borrowing committment thereunder from million to million 
o december share repurchases 
on december   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase plan pursuant to which the company may  at its sole and absolute discretion  repurchase up to million shares of common stock and common units 
in december  we used million of net proceeds from our recent disposition activity  either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under the revolving loan  to repurchase million shares of common stock through periodic open market or privately negotiated transactions at a weighted average price of per share 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of long term financings and the issuance of debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth information regarding our interest rate hedge contracts as of december  in thousands notional maturity fixed fair market type of hedge amount date reference rate rate value swap  month libor collar  month libor we enter into swaps  collars and caps to limit our exposure to an increase in variable interest rates  particularly with respect to amounts outstanding under our revolving loan 
the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
net payments made to counterparties under interest rate hedge contracts were  during and were recorded as increases to interest expense 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the interest rate hedge contracts 
we expect the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under these contracts 
however  if the counterparties were to default on their obligations under the interest rate hedge contracts  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rates in the contracts 
current and future cash needs 
historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to pay operating expenses  debt service  stockholder distributions and capital expenditures  excluding nonrecurring capital expenditures 
in addition  construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees have provided sources of cash flow 
we presently have no plans for major capital improvements to the existing properties  other than normal recurring building improvements  tenant improvements and lease commissions 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through working capital and net cash provided by operating activities along with the revolving loan 
our short term within the next months liquidity needs also include  among other things  the funding of approximately million of our existing development activity 
see business development activity 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity needs through a combination of o additional borrowings under our revolving loan approximately million was available as of march   o the issuance of secured debt  o the selective disposition of non core assets  and o the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties to strategic joint ventures to be formed with selected partners interested in investing with us  which will have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of existing and future development activity  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under the revolving loan and long term unsecured debt 
we remain committed to maintaining a flexible and conservative capital structure 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under the revolving loan 
we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  the company s ability to make the expected distributions to stockholders discussed below and satisfy other cash requirements may be adversely affected 
distributions to stockholders 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make distributions to its stockholders of at least of reit taxable income 
the company expects to use its cash flow from operating activities for distributions to stockholders and for payment of recurring  non incremental revenue generating expenditures 
the following factors will affect cash flows from operating activities and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding distributions debt service requirements after taking into account the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and procurement of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  and operating expenses and capital replacement needs 
recent developments stock repurchase 
from january  to march   the company repurchased million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of per share unit for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
disposition activity 
we currently have  rentable square feet of properties under contract for sale in various transactions totaling million 
additionally  million rentable square feet of properties are under various letters of intent for sale at million 
these transactions are subject to customary closing conditions  including due diligence and documentation  and are expected to close during the first and second quarters of however  we can provide no assurance that all or parts of these transactions will be consummated 
we expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from our recent and pending disposition activity to reinvest in tax deferred exchange transactions under section of the internal revenue code 
we expect to reinvest up to million of the remaining net proceeds from disposition activity as of december  and up to million of the net proceeds from pending disposition activity to acquire in tax deferred exchange transactions in service properties  development land and development projects located in core markets and in sub markets where we have a strong presence 
for an exchange to qualify for tax deferred treatment under section  the net proceeds from the sale of a property must be held by an escrow agent until applied toward the purchase of real estate qualifying for gain deferral 
given the competition for properties meeting our investment criteria  there may be some delay in reinvesting such proceeds 
delays in reinvesting such proceeds will reduce our income from operations 
in addition  the use of net proceeds from dispositions to fund development activity  either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under our revolving loan  will reduce our income from operations until such development projects are placed in service 
possible environmental liabilities in connection with owning or operating our properties  we may be liable for certain costs due to possible environmental liabilities 
under various laws  ordinances and regulations  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  and common law  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs to remove or remediate certain hazardous or toxic chemicals or substances on or in the property 
owners or operators are also liable for certain other costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic chemicals or substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to remediate such substances properly  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal  treatment or transportation of hazardous or toxic chemicals or substances may also be liable for the same types of costs at a disposal  treatment or storage facility  whether or not that person owns or operates that facility 
certain environmental laws also impose liability for releasing asbestos containing materials 
third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real property for personal injuries associated with asbestos containing materials 
a number of our properties have asbestos containing materials or material that we presume to be asbestos containing materials 
in connection with owning and operating our properties  we may be liable for such costs 
in addition  it is not unusual for property owners to encounter on site contamination caused by off site sources 
the presence of hazardous or toxic chemicals or substances at a site close to a property could require the property owner to participate in remediation activities or could adversely affect the value of the property 
contamination from adjacent properties has migrated onto at least three of our properties  however  based on current information  we do not believe that any significant remedial action is necessary at these affected sites 
as of the date hereof  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments and  in certain instances  phase ii environmental assessments on substantially all of our in service properties 
these assessments have not revealed  nor are we aware of  any environmental liability at our properties that we believe would materially adversely affect our financial position  operations or liquidity taken as a whole 
this projection  however  could be incorrect depending on certain factors 
for example  material environmental liabilities may have arisen after the assessments were performed or our assessments may not have revealed all environmental liabilities or may have underestimated the scope and severity of environmental conditions observed 
there may also be unknown environmental liabilities at properties for which we have not obtained a phase i environmental assessment or have not yet obtained a phase ii environmental assessment 
in addition  we base our assumptions regarding environmental conditions  including groundwater flow and the existence and source of contamination  on readily available sampling data 
we cannot guarantee that such data is reliable in all cases 
moreover  we cannot provide any assurances that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose a material environmental liability or that tenants  the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties or unrelated third parties will not affect the current environmental condition of our properties 
some tenants use or generate hazardous substances in the ordinary course of their respective businesses 
in their leases  we require these tenants to comply with all applicable laws and to be responsible to us for any damages resulting from their use of the property 
we are not aware of any material environmental problems resulting from tenants use or generation of hazardous or toxic chemicals or substances 
we cannot provide any assurances  however  that all tenants will comply with the terms of their leases or remain solvent 
if tenants do not comply or do not remain solvent  we may at some point be responsible for contamination caused by such tenants

requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the fair market value of our derivatives is discussed in item a 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act under the americans with disabilities act the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers  and noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  we may incur additional costs to comply with the ada 
although we believe that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on us  if required changes involve a greater expenditure than we currently anticipate  our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources could be materially adversely affected 
funds from operations and cash available for distributions we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo  as described below 
ffo and cash available for distributions should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo equals net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income in arriving at ffo 
in october  nareit issued an additional clarification effective as of january  stipulating that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results 
consistent with this clarification  non recurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under gaap will be reflected in the calculation of ffo 
gains and losses from the sale of depreciable operating property will continue to be excluded from the calculation of ffo 
cash available for distribution is defined as funds from operations reduced by non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements and tenant improvements and lease commissions related to second generation space 
ffo and cash available for distribution for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  ffo income before minority interest and extraordinary item    add deduct dividends on preferred stock    cost of unsuccessful transactions  severance costs and other division closing expenses  gain on disposition of assets   depreciation and amortization    depreciation on unconsolidated subsidiaries  ffo before minority interest    cash available for distribution add deduct rental income from straight line rents    amortization of deferred financing costs    non incremental revenue generating capital expenditures building improvements paid    second generation tenant improvements paid    second generation lease commissions paid    cash available for distribution    weighted average shares units outstanding diluted    dividend payout ratio ffo cash available for distribution assumes redemption of common units for shares of common stock 
minority interest common unit holders and the stockholders of the company share equally on a per common unit and per share basis  therefore  the per share information is unaffected by conversion 
inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on us because of the relatively low inflation rate in our geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  of the leases are for remaining terms of less than seven years  which may enable us to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements some of the information in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements 
such statements include  in particular  statements about our plans  strategies and prospects under the headings business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you can identify forward looking statements by our use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
although we believe that our plans  intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by such forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that our plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved 
when considering such forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the following important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement o our markets could suffer unexpected increases in development of office  industrial and retail properties  o the financial condition of our tenants could deteriorate  o the costs of our development projects could exceed our original estimates  o we may not be able to complete development  acquisition or joint venture projects as quickly or on as favorable terms as anticipated  o we may not be able to lease or release space quickly or on as favorable terms as old leases  o we may have incorrectly assessed the environmental condition of our properties  o an unexpected increase in interest rates would increase our debt service costs  o we may not be able to continue to meet our long term liquidity requirements on favorable terms  o we could lose key executive officers  and o our southeastern markets may suffer an unexpected decline in economic growth or increase in unemployment rates 
given these uncertainties  we caution you not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under the revolving loan bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of long term financings and the issuance of debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
certain variable rate debt 
as of december   the company had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense would be increased or decreased approximately million 
in addition  as of december   we had million of additional variable rate debt outstanding that was protected by an interest rate collar that effectively keeps the interest rate within a range of basis points 
we do not believe that a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would materially affect our interest expense with respect to this million of debt 
interest rate hedge contracts 
for a discussion of our interest rate hedge contracts in effect at december   see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capitalization 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts as of december  would increase by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties under the hedge contracts 
we expect the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under these contracts 
however  if the counterparties were to default on their obligations under the interest rate hedge contracts  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rates in the contracts
