individual membership revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared to the adjusted ebitda margin improved to positive from negative for the same periods 
the revenue growth is principally due to a greater number of members added year over year and increases in the average price of a membership 
the increase in the adjusted ebitda margin is primarily due to the revenue increases  since many of the infrastructure costs associated with providing services to members are not dependent on revenue volume  and reduction in solicitation spending  as we further refined the targeted audiences for our direct marketing efforts and achieved greater efficiencies in reaching potential new members 
beginning september   certain of individual membership s online businesses were no longer consolidated into our operations as a result of the ngi transaction

insurance wholesale revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared to primarily due to customer growth  which resulted from increases in affiliations with financial institutions 
the increase in affiliations with financial institutions was attributable principally to international expansion  while the adjusted ebitda increase was due to improved profitability in international markets as well as a million expense decrease related to longer amortization periods for certain customer acquisition costs as a result of a change in accounting estimate

real estate franchise revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in compared to royalty fees for the century registered trademark  coldwell banker registered trademark and era registered trademark franchise brands collectively increased by million primarily as a result of a increase in home sale transactions by franchisees and an increase in the average price of homes sold 
home sales by franchisees benefited from strong existing domestic home sales for the majority of  as well as from expansion of our franchise system 
existing domestic home sales are expected to decline compared to as a result of increases in interest rates 
declining home sales will impact royalty income since royalty income is based on gross commission income earned by agents and brokers on the sale of homes 
these declines are expected to be partially offset by increases in other areas of our business  such as real estate franchise sales and higher home resale prices 
beginning in the second quarter of  the financial results of the advertising funds for the coldwell banker and era brands were consolidated into the results of the real estate franchise segment  increasing revenues by million and expenses by a like amount  with no impact on adjusted ebitda 
revenues in benefited from million generated from the sale of portions of our preferred stock investment in nrt incorporated nrt  the independent company we helped form in to serve as a consolidator of residential real estate brokerages

in  revenues and adjusted ebitda benefited from the sale of a minority interest in an insurance subsidiary  which resulted in million of additional revenue and adjusted ebitda 
in  revenues and adjusted ebitda also benefited from an improvement in receivable collections  which permitted an million reduction in billing reserve requirements 
mortgage revenues increased million and adjusted ebitda decreased million  respectively  in compared with the increase in revenues resulted from a million increase in loan servicing revenues and a million increase in loan closing revenues 
the average servicing portfolio increased billion  with the average servicing fee increasing approximately seven basis points because of a reduction in the rate of amortization on servicing assets 
the reduced rate of amortization was caused by higher mortgage interest rates in total mortgage closing volume in was billion  a decline of million from however  purchase mortgage volume mortgages for home buyers increased billion to billion  offset by a billion decline in mortgage refinancing volume 
moreover  purchase mortgage volume from the teleservices business phone in move in and internet business log in move in increased billion  primarily because of increased purchase volume from our real estate franchisees 
industry origination volume is expected to be lower in compared to as a result of recent increases in interest rates and reduced refinancing volume 
we expect to offset lower refinancing volume with increased purchase mortgage volume in the adjusted ebitda margin decreased from in to in adjusted ebitda decreased in because of a million increase in expenses incurred within servicing operations for the larger of the increase in the average servicing portfolio and other expense increases for technology  infrastructure and teleservices to support capacity for volume anticipated in future periods

also contributing to the revenue growth are increased product sales and service fees  which are offered and provided to individual members 
the reduction in adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin is a direct result of a million increase in membership solicitation costs 
we increased our marketing efforts during to solicit new members and as a result increased our gross average annual membership base by approximately million members at december   compared to the prior year

home sales by franchisees benefited from existing home sales in the united states reaching a record million units in  according to data from the national association of realtors  as well as from expansion of our franchise systems 
because many costs associated with the real estate franchise business  such as franchise support and information technology  do not vary directly with home sales volumes or royalty revenues  the increase in royalty revenues contributed to an improvement in the adjusted ebitda margin from to 
relocation revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in over the adjusted ebitda margin improved from to 
the primary source of revenue growth was a million increase in revenues from the relocation of government employees 
we also experienced growth in the number of relocation related services provided to client corporations and in the number of household goods moves handled  partially offset by lower home sale volumes 
the divestiture of certain niche market property management operations accounted for other revenue of million 
expenses associated with government relocations increased in conjunction with the volume and revenue growth  but economies of scale and a reduction in overhead and administrative expenses permitted the reported improvement in the adjusted ebitda margin

mortgage closings increased billion to billion and average origination fees increased basis points  resulting in a million increase in origination revenues 
although the servicing portfolio grew billion  net servicing revenue was negatively impacted by average servicing fees declining basis points due to the increased refinancing levels in the mortgage market  which shortened the servicing asset life and increased amortization charges

the revenue increase is further attributable to a increase in fleet leasing fees and a increase in service fee revenue 
the fleet leasing revenue increase is due to a increase in pricing and a increase in the number of vehicles leased  while the service fee revenue increase is the result of a increase in number of fuel cards and vehicle maintenance cards partially offset by a decline in pricing 
the adjusted ebitda margin improvement reflects streamlining of costs at newly acquired harpur and a leveraging of our corporate infrastructure among more businesses

prior to september   our ownership of ngi was restructured into common stock and preferred stock interests 
on september  the donation date  we donated ngi s outstanding common stock to a charitable trust the trust  and ngi issued additional shares of its common stock to certain of its marketing partners 
the structure allows ngi to use its equity to attract  retain and incent employees and permits ngi to pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions and to make operational and strategic decisions without the need to consider the impact of those decisions on cendant 
in addition  the contribution establishes a charitable foundation that may enhance our image in the marketplace 
although no assurances can be given  we believe the donation of ngi to a separate autonomous entity will increase the likelihood that ngi will be successful and increase in value thereby increasing the value of our investment 
our shareholders should benefit from the potential increased value of ngi 
the beneficiaries of the trust include the inner city games foundation  the susan g 
komen breast cancer foundation  inc and community funds  inc 
the fair market value of ngi common stock on the donation date was estimated to be approximately million 
we retained the opportunity to participate in ngi s value through the ownership of convertible preferred stock of ngi  which is ultimately convertible  at our option  beginning september   into approximately of ngi s diluted common shares 
the convertible preferred stock is accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
the convertible preferred stock has a million annual preferred dividend  which will be recorded in income if and when it becomes realizable 
accordingly  as a result of the change in ownership of ngi s common stock from us to independent third parties  prospective from the donation date  ngi s operating results are no longer included in our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to our contribution of ngi s common stock to the trust  we provided a development advance of million to ngi  which is contingently repayable to us if certain financial targets related to ngi are achieved 
the purpose of the development advance was to provide ngi with the funds necessary to develop internet related products and systems  that if successful  would significantly increase the value of ngi 
without these funds  ngi would not have sufficient funds for development activities contemplated in its business plans 
repayment of the advance is therefore solely dependent on the success of the development efforts

during the fourth quarter of  as a result of changes in estimate  we adjusted certain merger related liabilities  which resulted in a million credit to unusual charges

the phh merger afforded us  at such time  an opportunity to rationalize our combined corporate  real estate and travel related businesses  and enabled our corre sponding support and service functions to gain organizational efficiencies and maximize profits 
we initiated a plan just prior to the phh merger to close hotel reservation call centers  combine travel agency operations and continue the downsizing of fleet operations by reducing headcount and eliminating unprofitable products 
in addition  we initiated plans to integrate our relocation  real estate franchise and mortgage origination businesses to capture additional revenues through the referral of one business unit s customers to another

pursuant to the agreement  arac acquired the net assets of the fleet businesses through the assumption and subsequent repayment of billion of intercompany debt and the issuance to us of million of convertible preferred stock of avis fleet leasing and management corporation avis fleet  a wholly owned subsidiary of arac 
coincident to the closing of the transaction  arac refinanced the assumed debt under management programs which was payable to us 
accordingly  we received additional consideration from arac comprised of billion of cash proceeds and a million receivable 
we realized a net gain on the disposition of the fleet business segment of million million  after tax of which million million  after tax was recognized at the time of closing and million million  after tax was deferred at the date of disposition 
the fleet segment disposition was structured as a tax free reorganization and  accordingly  no tax provision has been recorded on a majority of the gain 
however  pursuant to a recent interpretive ruling  the internal revenue service irs has taken the position that similarly structured transactions do not qualify as tax free reorganizations under internal revenue code section a a 
if the transaction is not considered a tax free reorganization  the resultant incremental liability could range between million and million depending upon certain factors including utilization of tax attributes and contractual indemnification provisions 
notwithstanding the irs interpretive ruling  we believe that  based upon analysis of current tax law  our position would prevail  if challenged 
other businesses

com  national leisure group and nlp

financing exclusive of management and mortgage program financing we have sufficient liquidity and access to liquidity through various sources  including our ability to access public equity and debt markets and financial institutions 
we currently have a million term loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
in addition  we also have committed back up facilities totaling billion  which are currently undrawn and available  with the exception of million of letters of credit 
furthermore  we also had billion of availability under existing shelf registration statements at december  which was subsequently reduced by million in connection with the liberty media transaction 
our long term debt  including current portion  was billion at december  and consisted of i approximately billion of publicly issued fixed rate debt comprised of million of senior notes   million of senior notes and million of convertible subordinated notes and ii million of borrowings under a term loan facility 
on january   we redeemed all outstanding senior notes at a redemption price of of par  plus accrued interest  using available cash 
our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  mergers  limitations on liens  liquidations and sale and leaseback transactions  and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
financing related to management and mortgage programs our phh subsidiary operates our mortgage and relocation services businesses as a separate public reporting entity and supports the origination of mortgages and advances under relocation contracts primarily by issuing commercial paper and medium term notes and maintaining secured obligations 
such financing is not classified based on contractual maturities  but rather is included in liabilities under management and mortgage programs rather than long term debt since such debt corresponds directly with high quality related assets 
phh continues to pursue opportunities to reduce its borrowing requirements by securitizing increasing amounts of its high quality assets 
additionally  we entered into a revolving sales agreement  under which an unaffiliated buyer the buyer  bishops gate residential mortgage trust  a special purpose entity  committed to purchase  at our option  mortgage loans originated by us on a daily basis  up to the buyer s asset limit of billion 
under the terms of this sale agreement  we retain the servicing rights on the mortgage loans sold to the buyer and arrange for the sale or securitization of the mortgage loans into the secondary market 
the buyer retains the right to select alternative sale or securitization arrangements 
at december  and  we were servicing approximately million and billion  respectively  of mortgage loans owned by the buyer 
phh debt is issued without recourse to the parent company 
our phh subsidiary expects to continue to maximize its access to global capital markets by maintaining the quality of its assets under management 
this is achieved by establishing credit standards to minimize credit risk and the potential for losses 
phh minimizes its exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk by effectively matching floating and fixed interest rate and maturity characteristics of funding to related assets  varying short and long term domestic and international funding sources  and securing available credit under committed banking facilities 
depending upon asset growth and financial market conditions  our phh subsidiary utilizes the united states commercial paper markets  public and private debt markets  as well as other cost effective short term instruments 
augmenting these sources  our phh subsidiary will continue to manage outstanding debt with the potential sale or transfer of managed assets to third parties while retaining fee related servicing responsibility 
at december   aggregate borrowings were comprised of commercial paper  medium term notes  secured obligations and other borrowings of billion  billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
phh filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  effective march   for the aggregate issuance of up to billion of medium term note debt securities 
these securities may be offered from time to time  together or separately  based on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
as of december   phh had approximately million of availability remaining under this shelf registration statement 
proceeds from future offerings will continue to be used to finance assets phh manages for its clients and for general corporate purposes 
secured obligations in december  our phh subsidiary renewed its day financing agreement to sell mortgage loans under an agreement to repurchase such mortgages 
the agreement is collateralized by the underlying mortgage loans held in safekeeping by the custodian to the agreement 
the total commitment under this agreement is million and is renewable on an annual basis at the discretion of the lender in accordance with the securitization agreement 
mortgage loans financed under this agreement at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
we are currently in the process of creating a new securitization facility to purchase interests in the rights to payment related to our relocation receivables 
although no assurances can be given  we expect that such facility will be in place by the end of the first quarter of other to provide additional financial flexibility  phh s current policy is to ensure that minimum committed facilities aggregate percent of the average amount of outstanding commercial paper 
as of december   phh maintained billion of unsecured committed credit facilities  which were provided by domestic and foreign banks 
on february   phh reduced these facilities to billion to reflect reduced borrowing needs of phh after the disposition of its fleet businesses 
the facilities consist of a million revolving credit maturing in february and a million revolving credit maturing in february our management closely evaluates not only the credit of the banks but also the terms of the various agreements to ensure ongoing availability 
the full amount of phh s committed facilities at december  was undrawn and available 
our management believes that our current policy provides adequate protection should volatility in the financial markets limit phh s access to commercial paper or medium term notes funding 
phh continuously seeks additional sources of liquidity to accommodate phh asset growth and to provide further protection from volatility in the financial markets 
in the event that the public debt market is unable to meet phh s funding needs  we believe that phh has appropriate alternative sources to provide adequate liquidity  including current and potential future securitized obligations and its revolving credit facilities 
on july   phh entered into a supplemental indenture no 
the supplemental indenture with a bank  as trustee  under the senior indenture dated as of june   which formalizes phh s policy of limiting the payment of dividends and the outstanding principal balance of loans to us to of consolidated net income as defined in the supplemental indenture for each fiscal year 
the supplemental indenture prohibits phh from paying dividends or making loans to us if upon giving effect to such dividends and or loan  phh s debt to equity ratio exceeds to  at the time of the dividend or loan  as the case may be 
litigation since the april  announcement of the discovery of accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc  approximately lawsuits claiming to be class actions  two lawsuits claiming to be brought derivatively on our behalf and several individual lawsuits and arbitration proceedings have been commenced in various courts and other forums against us and other defendants by or on behalf of persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired securities or options issued by cuc or us between may and august the court has ordered consolidation of many of the actions 
in addition  in october  an action claiming to be a class action was filed against us and four of our former officers and directors by persons claiming to have purchased american bankers stock between january and october the complaint claimed that we made false and misleading public announcements and filings with the sec in connection with our proposed acquisition of american bankers allegedly in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and that the plaintiff and the alleged class members purchased american bankers securities in reliance on these public announcements and filings at inflated prices 
on april   the united states district court for new jersey found that the class action failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and  accordingly  dismissed the complaint 
the plaintiff has appealed the district court s findings to the us court of appeals for the third circuit as such appeal is pending 
the sec and the united states attorney for the district of new jersey are conducting investigations relating to the matters referenced above 
the sec advised us that its inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the sec or its staff that any violations of law have occurred 
as a result of the findings from our internal investigations  we made all adjustments considered necessary which are reflected in our previously filed restated financial statements for the years ended  and and for the six months ended june  although we can provide no assurances that additional adjustments will not be necessary as a result of these government investigations  we do not expect that additional adjustments will be necessary 
as previously disclosed  we reached a final agreement with plaintiffs counsel representing the class of holders of our prides securities who purchased their securities on or prior to april  to settle their class action lawsuit against us through the issuance of a new right for each prides security held 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the settlement 
on december   we announced that we reached a preliminary agreement to settle the principal securities class action pending against us in the us district court in newark  new jersey relating to the common stock class action lawsuits 
under the agreement  we would pay the class members approximately billion in cash  an increase from approximately billion previously reported 
the increase is a result of continued negotiation toward definitive documents relating to additional costs to be paid to the plaintiff class 
the settlement remains subject to execution of a definitive settlement agreement and approval by the us district court 
if the preliminary settlement is not approved by the us district court  we can make no assurances that the final outcome or settlement of such proceedings will not be for an amount greater than that set forth in the preliminary agreement 
the proposed settlements do not encompass all litigation asserting claims associated with the accounting irregularities 
we do not believe that it is feasible to predict or determine the final outcome or resolution of these unresolved proceedings 
an adverse outcome from such unresolved proceedings could be material with respect to earnings in any given reporting period 
however  we do not believe that the impact of such unresolved proceedings should result in a material liability to our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
our plan to finance the settlement reflects the existence of a range of financing alternatives which we have considered to be potentially available 
at a minimum  these alternatives entail using various combinations of i available cash  ii debt securities and or iii equity securities 
the choice among alternatives will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of the actual settlement payment  the relative costs of various securities  our cash balance  our projected post settlement cash flows and market conditions

cash flows vs 
we generated billion of cash flows from operations in representing a billion increase from the increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to a billion increase in net income as adjusted for discontinued operations activity  net gain on dispositions of businesses and non cash charges

we generated billion in cash flows from investing activities in representing a billion increase from the incremental cash flows in from investing activities was primarily attributable to a billion increase in net proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries  primarily related to the fleet businesses  and a billion decrease in cash used in acquisition related activity acquisitions in included ncp  green flag and jackson hewitt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses various financial instruments  particularly interest rate and currency swaps  forward delivery commitments  futures and options contracts and currency forwards  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities  and debt 
such financial instruments are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its foreign currency denominated translational and transactional exposures 
the company is exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
the company does not engage in trading  market making  or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
the company s derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges of underlying exposures  as those instruments demonstrate high correlation in relation to the asset or transaction being hedged 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest and currency rate risks are the principal market exposures of the company 
o interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact the company s profitability 
the company s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgagor prepayments  mortgage loans held for sale  and anticipated mortgage production arising from commitments issued and libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings 
the company anticipates that such interest rates will remain a primary market exposure of the company for the foreseeable future 
o the company s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations of the british pound sterling 
the company anticipates that such foreign currency exchange rate will remain a primary market exposure of the company for the foreseeable future 
the company assesses its market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in earnings  fair values  and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
the company uses a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair market value of investment in leases and leased vehicles  relocation receivables  equity advances on homes  mortgages  commitments to fund mortgages  mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment speeds and discount rates 
in determining the fair market value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities  the models also utilize credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrowers propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgages and commitments to fund mortgages forward delivery contracts and options  the company uses an option adjusted spread oas model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
the company also utilizes the oas model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumption in an oas model is the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions used in determining fair market value 
the company uses a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on its debt portfolio and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
the company uses a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives and monetary assets and liabilities 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all currency exposures of the company at december  and the company s total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis permitted  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
the company used december  and market rates on its instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of the company s market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
the company has determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on its earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
