however  as a result of various legislative and regulatory changes since  the commercial and consumer lending powers of the bank have increased substantially 
consequently  the bank initiated a diversification strategy in fiscal year which included a significant increase in commercial real estate lending 
commercial real estate lending was temporarily discontinued in and only originations required by previous funding commitments were made 
in  the bank began to originate small business and commercial real estate loans in its primary market area 
the bank s current lending activity is concentrated on lending to consumers and small businesses in the mid atlantic region of the united states

the above schedule does not include any prepayment assumptions 
although prepayments tend to be highly dependent upon the current interest rate environment  management believes that the actual repricing and maturity of the loan and lease portfolio is significantly shorter than is reflected in the above table as a result of prepayments 
residential real estate lending 
wsfs originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to  however  the bank generally requires private mortgage insurance for up to of the mortgage amount on mortgage loans whose loan to value ratio exceeds 
the bank does not have any significant concentrations of such insurance with any one insurer 
on a very limited basis  the bank originates loans with loan to value ratios exceeding without a private mortgage insurance requirement 
at december   the balance of all such loans was approximately million 
generally  residential mortgage loans originated or purchased are underwritten and documented in accordance with standard underwriting criteria published by fhlmc to assure maximum eligibility for subsequent sale in the secondary market  however  unless loans are specifically designated for sale  the company holds newly originated loans in portfolio for long term investment 
among other things  title insurance is required  insuring the priority of its lien  and fire and extended coverage casualty insurance for the properties securing the residential loans 
all properties securing residential loans made by the bank are appraised by independent appraisers selected by the bank and subject to review in accordance with bank standards 
the majority of residential real estate adjustable rate loans currently originated have interest rates that adjust yearly  after an initial period  with the change in rate limited to two percentage points at any adjustment date 
the adjustments are generally based upon a margin currently percent over the weekly average yield on us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity  as published by the federal reserve board 
generally  the maximum rate on these loans is up to six percent above the initial interest rate 
the bank generally underwrites adjustable rate loans under standards consistent with private mortgage insurance and secondary market criteria 
the bank does not originate adjustable rate mortgages with payment limitations that could produce negative amortization 
consistent with industry practice in its market area  the bank has typically originated adjustable rate mortgage loans with initially discounted interest rates 
all such loans are underwritten at the fully indexed rate 
the retention of adjustable rate mortgage loans in the bank s loan portfolio helps mitigate the bank s risk to changes in interest rates 
however  there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the repricing of adjustable rate mortgage loans 
it is possible that during periods of rising interest rates  the risk of default on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest costs to the borrower 
further  although adjustable rate mortgage loans allow the bank to increase the sensitivity of its asset base to changes in interest rates  the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that yields on the bank s adjustable rate mortgages will adjust sufficiently to compensate for increases in the bank s cost of funds during periods of extreme interest rate increases 
the original contractual loan payment period for residential loans originated is normally to years 
because borrowers may refinance or prepay their loans without penalty  such loans normally remain outstanding for a substantially shorter period of time 
first mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses on adjustable and fixed rate loans  which are provisions giving the institutions the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage 
due on sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rate on existing fixed rate mortgage loans to current market rates 
the bank enforces due on sale clauses through foreclosure and other legal proceedings to the extent available under applicable laws 
commercial real estate and commercial lending 
federal savings banks  are generally permitted to invest up to of its total regulatory capital in nonresidential real estate loans and up to of its assets in commercial loans 
as a federal savings bank which was formerly chartered as a delaware savings bank  however  the bank has certain additional lending authority 
from to  the bank had been operating under a capital plan and was subject to the terms and conditions of a capital directive 
consequently  wsfs had discontinued the origination of commercial real estate and construction loans other than renewal of performing loans or funding outstanding commitments 
beginning in  after the plan and directive were lifted  the bank began to originate commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans in its primary market area 
wsfs offers commercial real estate mortgage loans on multi family and other commercial real estate 
generally  loan to value ratios for such loans do not exceed of appraised value at origination 
as a result of subsequent changes in the real estate market  however  current loan to value ratios on certain loans could effectively be in excess of 
the bank offers commercial construction loans to developers 
these loans are made as construction permanent loans  which provides for disbursement of loan funds during construction and automatic conversion to mini permanent loans years upon completion of construction 
such construction loans are made on a short term basis  usually not exceeding two years  with interest rates indexed to the wsfs prime rate and adjusted periodically as the bank s prime rate changes 
the loan appraisal process includes the same criteria as required for permanent mortgage loans as well as completed plans  specifications  comparables and cost estimates 
these items are used  prior to approval of the credit  as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property when completed 
policy requires that all appraisals are to be reviewed independently of the commercial lending area 
generally  the loan to value ratio for construction loans does not exceed 
the initial interest rate on the permanent portion of the financing is determined based upon the prevailing market rate at the time of conversion to the permanent loan 
at december   million was committed for construction loans  of which million had been disbursed 
the bank s commercial lending  excluding real estate loans  includes loans for the purpose of financing equipment acquisitions  expansion  working capital and other business purposes 
these loans generally range in amounts up to approximately million  and their terms range from less than one year to seven years 
the loans generally carry variable interest rates indexed to the bank s prime rate or libor at the time of closing 
the bank intends to continue originating commercial loans to small businesses in its market area 
commercial  commercial mortgages and construction lending entail significant risk as compared with residential mortgage lending 
these loans typically involve larger loan balances concentrated in single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  the payment experience on loans secured by income producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the commercial real estate market or in the economy generally 
the majority of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans is concentrated in delaware and surrounding areas 
construction loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced as the construction progresses 
the valuation of the underlying collateral can be difficult to quantify prior to the completion of the construction due to uncertainties inherent in construction such as ever changing construction costs  delays arising from labor or material shortages and other unpredictable contingencies 
the bank attempts to mitigate these risks and plan for these contingencies through additional analysis and monitoring of its construction projects 
federal law limits the extensions of credit to any one borrower to of unimpaired capital  or  if the additional incremental is secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value that can be determined by reliable and continually available pricing 
a single large extension of credit by the bank would be limited by this of capital restriction  except if the extension of credit would be fully or partially secured by us treasury securities 
extensions of credit include outstanding loans as well as contractual commitments to advance funds  such as standby letters of credit  but do not include unfunded loan commitments 
in april  the bank originated a million loan to refinance an employee stock ownership plan esop loan of a company 
approximately of the loan is secured by discounted us treasury securities 
the portion of the loan that is secured by us treasury securities is exempt from the above lending limits 
at december   no borrower had collective outstandings exceeding the above limits 
consumer lending 
the primary consumer credit products  excluding leases  of the company are equity secured installment loans and home equity lines of credit 
with a home equity line of credit the borrower is granted a line of credit up to of the appraised value net of any senior mortgages of the residence 
this line of credit is secured by a mortgage on the borrower s property and can be drawn upon at any time 
at december   the bank had extended a total of million in home equity lines of credit  of which million had been drawn at the date 
home equity lines of credit offer federal income tax advantages in certain circumstances the interest paid on a home equity loan can be deductible and the convenience of checkbook access as well as revolving credit features 
over the past few years  however  home equity lines of credit have decreased as low interest rates offered on first and second mortgage loans have enabled consumers to refinance their mortgages and consolidate debt 
although home equity lines of credit expose the company to the risk that falling collateral values may leave it inadequately secured  the company has not had any significant adverse experience to date 
operating leases 
through its wsfs credit corporation wcc subsidiary  the company originates operating leases on new motor vehicles through a network of unaffiliated dealers in the mid atlantic states 
in the typical operating lease transaction  the company acquires title to the vehicle from the dealer and leases the vehicle to the customer on terms such that the total lease payments will equal the projected economic depreciation on the vehicle during the lease term plus a financing charge 
the customer assumes responsibility for all other costs of ownership 
at the end of the lease  the customer has the option of either acquiring the vehicle at an agreed upon price or surrendering the vehicle to wcc 
in the event the vehicle is surrendered  the company promptly sells the vehicle in order to recoup its investment 
in addition to credit risks  operating leases expose the company to the risk that the resale value of the leased vehicle will be less than the residual value estimated at the beginning of the lease 
the company s operating leases are generally for terms of to months and the average estimated residual value of the vehicles under lease is approximately of their manufactures suggested retail price 
at december   the company had million in vehicles under operating leases  net of reserves for credit losses and losses on resale of off lease vehicles 
due to expected softness in the resale market of certain vehicles  the company took a charge of million during the year ended december  for likely losses on resales of leased vehicles

as part of the loan application  the borrower in some instances  also pays the bank for out of pocket costs in reviewing the application  whether or not the loan is closed 
the interest rate charged on the mortgage loan is normally the prevailing rate at the time the loan application is approved 
loan fees that are considered adjustments of yield in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are reflected in interest income and represented an immaterial amount of interest income during the three years ended december  loan fees other than those considered adjustments of yield are reported as loan fee income  a component of other income 
loan and lease loss experience  problem assets and delinquencies the company s results of operations can be negatively impacted by nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued  but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
the company endeavors to manage its portfolios to identify problem loans and leases as promptly as possible and take actions immediately which will minimize losses 
to accomplish this  the bank s risk management department monitors the asset quality of the company s loan  lease and investment in real estate portfolios and reports such information to the credit policy committee the audit committee of the board of directors and the controller s department

the ots capital rule defines tier or core capital as common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual institutions and qualifying supervisory goodwill  less intangible assets other than certain supervisory goodwill and  subject to certain limitations  mortgage and non mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships 
tangible capital is given the same definition as core capital but does not include qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings institution s intangible assets except for limited amounts of mortgage servicing rights 
the ots capital rule requires that core and tangible capital be reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in nonincludable subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible to national banks  other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies 
adjusted total assets for purposes of the core and tangible capital requirements are a savings institution s total assets as determined under generally accepted accounting principles  increased by certain goodwill amounts and by a prorated portion of the assets of unconsolidated includable subsidiaries in which the savings institution holds a minority interest 
adjusted total assets are reduced by the amount of assets that have been deducted from capital  the savings institution s minority investments in unconsolidated includable subsidiaries and  for purposes of the core capital requirement  qualifying supervisory goodwill 
at december   the bank was in compliance with both the core and tangible capital requirements 
the risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
under the ots risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a risk weight 
mortgage backed securities that qualify under the secondary mortgage enhancement act  including those issued  or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest  by the fnma or fhlmc  are assigned a risk weight 
single family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding  fixed rate multi family first mortgages not more than days past due with loan to value ratios not exceeding if rate is adjustable  and annual net operating income equal to not less than of debt service if loan is adjustable and certain qualifying loans for the construction of one to four family residences pre sold to home purchasers are assigned a risk weight of 
consumer loans  non qualifying residential construction loans and commercial real estate loans  repossessed assets and assets more than days past due  as well as all other assets not specifically categorized  are assigned a risk weight of 
the portion of equity investments not deducted from core or supplementary capital is assigned a risk weight 
in determining compliance with the risk based capital requirement  a savings institution is allowed to include both core capital and supplementary capital in its total capital  provided the amount of supplementary capital included does not exceed the savings institution s core capital 
supplementary capital is defined to include certain preferred stock issues  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that do not qualify as core capital  certain approved subordinated debt  certain other capital instruments and a portion of the savings institution s general loan and lease loss allowances 
the ots risk based capital standards require savings institutions with more than a normal level of interest rate risk to maintain additional total capital 
a savings institution s interest rate risk is measured in terms of the sensitivity of its net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
a savings association with more than normal interest rate risk is required to deduct an interest rate risk component equal to one half of the excess of its measured interest rate risk over the normal level from its total capital for purposes of determining its compliance with the ots risk based capital guidelines 
at december   the bank was in compliance with the ots risk based capital requirements 
loans to directors  officers and stockholders 
under section h of the federal reserve act  loans to an executive officer or director or to a greater than stockholder of a savings association and certain affiliated interests of either  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests  the association s loans to one borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to all such persons may not exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans  above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency  to directors  executive officers and greater than stockholders of a savings association  and their respective affiliates  unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the association with any interested director not participating in the voting 
the federal reserve board has prescribed the loan amount which includes all other outstanding loans to such person  as to which such prior board of director approval if required  as being the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
further  loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit plan that is widely available to employees and does not discriminate in favor of insiders 
section h also prohibits a depository institution from paying the overdrafts of any of its executive officers or directors 
savings associations are subject to the requirements and restrictions of section g of the federal reserve act which requires that loans to executive officers of depository institutions not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded to other borrowers  requires approval for such extensions of credit by the board of directors of the institution  and imposes reporting requirements for and additional restrictions on the type  amount and terms of credits to such officers 
section of the bank holding company act bhca prohibits extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  and greater than stockholders of a depository institution by any other institution which has a correspondent banking relationship with the institution  unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
dividend restrictions 
savings associations must submit notice to the ots prior to making a capital distribution which includes cash dividends  stock repurchases and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash merger if a they would not be well capitalized after the distribution  b the distribution would result in the retirement of any of the association s common or preferred stock or debt counted as its regulatory capital  or c the association is a subsidiary of a holding company 
a savings association must make application to the ots to pay a capital distribution if x the association would not be adequately capitalized following the distribution  y the association s total distributions for the calendar year exceeds the association s net income for the calendar year to date plus its net income less distributions for the preceding two years  or z the distribution would otherwise violate applicable law or regulation or an agreement with or condition imposed by the ots 
deposit insurance 
the bank may be charged semi annual premiums by the fdic for federal insurance on its insurable deposit accounts up to applicable regulatory limits 
the fdic may establish an assessment rate for deposit insurance premiums which protects the insurance fund and considers the fund s operating expenses  case resolution expenditures  income and effect of the assessment rate on the earnings and capital of members 
the assessment rate for an insured depository institution depends on the assessment risk classification assigned to the institution by the fdic which is determined by the institution s capital level and supervisory evaluations 
institutions are assigned to one of three capital groups well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized using the same percentage criteria as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
see prompt corrective action 
within each capital group  institutions will be assigned to one of three subgroups on the basis of supervisory evaluations by the institution s primary supervisory authority and such other information as the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
because the bank insurance fund bif achieved its statutory reserve ratio of of insured deposits  the fdic has eliminated deposit insurance premiums for most bif members 
the fdic  however  continues to assess bif member institutions to fund interest payments on certain bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to help fund takeovers of insolvent thrifts 
until december   bif members were assessed at approximately one fifth the rate at which savings association insurance fund saif members were assessed 
after december   bif and saif members are being assessed at the same rate of basis points on deposits 
prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution generally is i subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  ii required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  iii subject to asset growth limits  and iv required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
significantly undercapitalized institutions and their holding companies may become subject to more severe sanctions including limitations on asset growth  restrictions on capital distributions by the holding company and possible divestiture requirements 
institutions generally must be placed in receivership within specified periods of time after they become critically undercapitalized 
under the ots regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  the ots measures a savings institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
a savings institution that is not subject to an order or written directive to meet or maintain a specific capital level is deemed well capitalized if it also has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater 
an adequately capitalized savings institution is a savings institution that does not meet the definition of well capitalized and has i a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii a tier capital risk based ratio of or greater  and iii a leverage ratio of or greater or or greater if the savings institution has a composite camel rating 
an undercapitalized institution is a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than or if the institution has a composite camels rating 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is defined as a savings institution that has i a total risk based capital ratio of less than  or ii a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or iii a leverage ratio of less than 
a critically undercapitalized savings institution is defined as a savings institution that has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of less than

pursuant to regulations of the federal reserve board  a savings institution must maintain average daily reserves equal to on the first million of transaction accounts  plus on the remainder 
this percentage is subject to adjustment by the federal reserve board 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  the effect of the reserve requirement may be to reduce the amount of the institution s interest earning assets 
as of december  the bank met its reserve requirements 
financial modernization legislation on november   president clinton signed legislation which could have a far reaching impact on the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley g l b act authorizes affiliations between banking  securities and insurance firms and authorizes bank holding companies and national banks to engage in a variety of new financial activities 
among the new activities that will be permitted to qualifying bank holding companies are securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking

the following discussion focuses on the major components of the company s operations and presents an overview of the significant changes in the corporation s results of operations for the past three fiscal years and financial condition during the past two fiscal years 
this discussion should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ending december   compared to million and million in and  respectively 
included in the annual results were nonrecurring and unusual items discussed below that net  added approximately million to net income or to earnings per share 
earnings for were impacted by an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  on the early extinguishment of million in senior notes 
adjusting for the extraordinary charge in and the nonrecurring and unusual items in  net income amounted to million for both years 
earnings per share  however  grew to as a result of share buybacks 
net interest income 
net interest income remains the most significant component of operating income to the corporation 
net interest income is reliant upon the levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the difference or spread between the respective yields earned and rates paid 
the interest rate spread is influenced by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that affect interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
the level of nonperforming loans can also impact the interest rate spread by reducing the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
the corporation classifies substantially all leases originated by its vehicle leasing subsidiary to operating leases in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
accordingly  income on these leases  has been presented as other income  consistent with the operating lease treatment 
the increasing magnitude of such assets in recent years has had a negative impact on the net interest margin 
net interest income increased to million in compared with million in total interest income increased million  between and primarily due to an increase in average balances for mortgage backed securities of million over the previous year 
in addition  the average total loan balances increased million above the prior year s level 
partially offsetting the benefit to net interest income attributable to the increase in balances was the general decline in average interest rates in versus the average yield on mortgage backed securities declined to from while the average yield on total loans declined to from  between and total interest expense increased  between and as a result of the growth in interest bearing deposits by an average of million 
this was partially offset by a basis point drop on the average rate paid on deposits  in versus in  due to favorable repricing of deposit rates 
in addition  interest expense related to borrowed funds declined  in as a result of the reduced rate environment 
at the end of  the company reduced long term borrowing rates by issuing million in lower cost trust preferred securities as replacement financing for its senior notes 
between and  interest income decreased million  while interest expense increased million 
the primary decrease in interest income was related to the decline in average loan balances of million and the declining interest rate environment 
the decline in average loan balances was more than offset by the growth in mortgage backed securities of million 
however  the average yield on mortgage backed securities of was basis points below the average yield on total loans of 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the growth in interest bearing deposits by an average of million 
this increase in deposits was used to fund growth in operating leases and mortgage backed securities 
this was partially offset by a decline in the average rate paid on deposits to from  between and the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior year rate  ii changes in rates change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  and iii net change

provision for loan losses 
the corporation considers  among other things  identifiable and inherent risks in its loan portfolio in periodically establishing the amount of the provision for loan losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
such risks are determined based upon an ongoing review of the loan portfolio  which includes the identification and assessment of adverse situations that may affect borrowers debt servicing ability  an analysis of overall portfolio quality and prior loan loss experience as well as an appraisal of current economic conditions 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management deems adequate to provide for potential losses 
the corporation s continued efforts to resolve and collect problem loans  including nonaccrual and restructured loans favorably impacted the provision 
this was evident in as the provision for loan loss of million decreased from million in the allowance for loan loss was million at december   a decrease from the level reported at december  the corporation will continue to adjust the provision for loan losses periodically as necessary to maintain the allowance at what is deemed to be an adequate level  based on the previously discussed criteria 
as the provision is primarily a function of credit quality  changes in the provision for loan losses are contingent upon the economic conditions of the corporation s market area and the economic prospects of borrowers 
other income 
included in other income for the fourth quarter were the following items million in securities losses on the sale of million of investment securities and a million loss on the designated sale of loans held for sale 
these below market yielding investments and loans were purchased and originated in a lower rate environment  and are expected to be replaced by higher yielding assets in to better position the corporation for the current higher interest rate environment 
in addition  the corporation also posted a million charge for the estimated residual value losses on certain leased vehicles within wsfs credit corporation s prime vehicle leasing portfolio 
finally  the corporation recorded a gain of  from the value of common stock received on the demutualization of an insurance company in which the corporation was a policyholder 
excluding the above mentioned items  other income increased million during to million 
other income  excluding the above mentioned items  included increases of million in operating lease revenue and million in debit credit card and atm income 
these increases resulted from a growth in the operating lease portfolio  and the expansion of the bank s atm network 
at december   the bank derived income from  atms compared to at december  other income increased million between and to million in consistent with results  this increase was largely attributable to growth in the corporation s average operating lease portfolio during as a result  the net rental income from operating leases increased million during the year 
in addition  debit credit and atm income increased million as a result of expansion of the atm network 
other expenses 
other expenses of million  increased million during from expenses increased mainly in salaries  equipment expense  professional fees and data processing and operations expense 
these increases were attributable to investments in retail banking offices  atms  and improvements in technology 
as part of this investment the corporation added four new branch offices during the year 
in addition  expenses of million from the not wholly owned cfn and wnfi investments have been incorporated into other expenses 
the unowned portion of the results of these subsidiaries has been eliminated through minority interest  on an after tax basis  in the consolidated statement of operations 
other expenses increased million between and to million 
expense rose primarily due to increases in salaries excluding stock appreciation rights sars  equipment  data processing and operating expenses  occupancy and other operating expenses 
these increases were associated with the continued investment in new retail banking offices  our atm network and technological enhancements 
as part of this investment the corporation added four new branch offices and new owned and operated atms as well as establishing a large number of relationships with independent service organizations to provide funding for atms nationwide 
these increases in expenses were offset in part by expenses associated with sars  which declined million during the year 
sars are similar to stock options  but  unlike stock options  accounting for sars requires a charge to operating expenses as the stock price changes above the exercise price 
this decline largely reflects the lower stock price at december  as compared to december  in addition  other expenses were favorably affected by lower costs associated with foreclosed assets 
this decrease was attributable to an improvement in the level of nonperforming assets during the year 
income taxes 
the corporation recorded a million tax provision for the year ended december  compared to tax provisions of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state  and local income taxes that are currently payable and those currently deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
the years  and include million  million  and million in acquired tax benefits  respectively 
the increase in tax benefits resulted primarily from a change in the tax code and an expiration of a holding period related to built in losses of an acquired subsidiary 
as a result of the change in tax code  certain tax benefits  which were previously offset by a valuation allowance  are now recognizable based upon the continued profitability of the wsfs consolidated group 
approximately million in gross deferred tax assets of the corporation at december  is related to built in losses on reverse mortgages that are attributable to a former subsidiary  providential home income plan  inc providential 
management has continued to provide substantial valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets due to limitations imposed by the internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization on these assets 
as historical data accumulates  management continues to obtain more information on which to base the potential recognition of these assets 
the corporation analyzes its projection of taxable income on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its provision benefit for income taxes  accordingly

financial condition total assets grew million or during to billion 
this growth occurred predominantly in loans and vehicles under operating leases  partially offset by a decline in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and mortgage backed securities 
total liabilities grew million during the year to billion at december  this increase occurred primarily in deposits and borrowings 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase resulted primarily from earnings  offset in part by the acquisition of treasury stock 
investments 
between december  and  total investments declined million 
during  federal funds sold decreased million 
in addition  investments in reverse mortgages decreased million  primarily due to collections 
these decreases were partially offset by the purchase of an additional million in stock in federal home loan bank fhlb of pittsburgh 
mortgage backed securities 
investments in mortgage backed securities decreased million during to million 
during  the corporation purchased million in collateralized mortgage obligations  however  these purchases were more than offset by principal repayments of million and a decline of million in the fair market value of mortgage backed securities available for sale 
loans 
net loans  including loans held for sale  increased million between december  and this increase was primarily due to a million increase in residential mortgages 
the growth in residential mortgages was a result of a shift to the adjustable rate lending environment in late  as interest rates increased 
the corporation has traditionally retained adjustable rate mortgages in its portfolio 
in addition  commercial and consumer loans increased million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in commercial mortgages  mainly resulting from million in loan payoffs that occurred in the first quarter of vehicles under operating leases 
vehicles under operating leases grew million during this increase resulted primarily from originations during the year 
deposits 
deposits grew million during to million 
this growth was largely attributable to a net inflow of deposits of million and interest credited to deposits of million 
the table below depicts the changes in deposits over the last three years year ended december  in millions beginning balance interest credited deposit inflows outflows  net ending balance borrowings 
total borrowings increased million between december  and approximately million in borrowings from the federal home loan bank were added during the year as well as million in sweep repurchase agreements 
these increases were offset in part by a million decline in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase included million in net income offset in part by the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock for million and dividends of million declared and paid to stockholders 
in addition net unrealized losses on securities available for sale increased million during asset liability management the primary asset liability management goal of the corporation is to manage and control its interest rate risk  thereby reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  and achieving sustainable growth in net interest income over the long term 
other objectives of asset liability management include ensuring adequate liquidity and funding  maintaining a strong capital base and maximizing net interest income opportunities 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
management regularly reviews the corporation s interest rate sensitivity  and uses a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of the primary strategies utilized by the corporation to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of the corporation s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are set forth in the following table less than one to over one year five years five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans     commercial loans     consumer loans and leases     vehicles under operating leases    mortgage backed securities     loans held for sale   investment in reverse mortgages     investment securities     other investments   interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits    savings deposits    retail time deposits     jumbo certificates of deposit    brokered certificates of deposit    fhlb advances    trust preferred borrowings and interest rate cap   other borrowed funds    excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap     interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage loans 
to provide a more accurate one year gap position of the corporation  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
management estimates  based on historical trends of the bank s deposit accounts  that of money market and interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit products with interest rates based on a particular index are classified according to the specific repricing characteristic of the index 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are typically subject to local market conditions and management s discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
in november  the corporation purchased a ten year interest rate cap in order to limit its exposure on million of variable rate trust preferred securities issued in november this derivative instrument caps month libor the base rate of the trust preferred at 
the trust preferred is classified in the over five years category reflecting the inability to price upward for the balance on the term of the interest rate cap 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as the company adjusts its interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
one measure  required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the chart below is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a december  change in interest change in change in rate net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio basis points margin value margin value reflects a change with respect to the npv value of demand deposits in this column represents the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected in the various rate increments 
this column represents the net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected in the various rate increments 
december  has been restated to reflect the interest sensitive nature of the operating lease portfolio 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on the company s asset liability structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure can negatively affect the corporation s results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest 
past due loans are loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the corporation s non performing assets  restructured loans and past due loans and leases at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans nonperforming leases commercial    consumer commercial mortgages      residential mortgages      construction   total nonaccruing loans nonperforming leases      nonperforming investments in real estate   assets acquired through foreclosure      total nonperforming assets      restructured loans    past due loans leases residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages   consumer total past due loans     ratio of nonaccruing loans leases to total loans leases ratio of allowance for loan lease losses to gross loans leases ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan lease losses allowance to nonaccruing loans leases ratio of loan lease losses and foreclosed asset allowance to total nonperforming assets total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
total nonperforming assets decreased by million between and and by million between and in  million in collections of such assets  million in charge offs writedowns  and million in transfers to accrual restructured status contributed to the reduction in nonperforming assets 
such decreases were offset by the addition of million of assets that were not previously classified as nonperforming assets 
the decrease in the levels of nonperforming assets reflect management s continued efforts to identify and resolve problem assets coupled with the effects of the current economic environment 
an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three fiscal years is presented below year ended december  in thousands beginning balance    additions    collections    transfers to accrual restructured status    transfers to investment in real estate charge offs write downs   ending balance    the level of nonaccruing loans and the nonperforming leases to total loans leases ratio decreased from

in both the continued reduction in nonaccruing assets and nonperforming loans and the increase in total loans leases and assets  contributed to the improved ratios 
in  assets acquired through foreclosure reductions of million accounted for the majority of the decrease in total nonperforming assets 
allowance for loan lease losses 
the corporation maintains allowances for credit losses and charges losses to these allowances when such losses are considered probable 
the allowances for losses are maintained at a level which management considers adequate to provide for potential losses based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolios 
management s evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolios  which include factors such as identification of adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  a review of overall portfolio quality  prior loss experience and an assessment of current and expected economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions and economic prospects of debtors can occur quickly  and as a result  impact the estimates made by management 
additionally  each quarter  management evaluates the collectibility of each loan and lease in the nonperforming portfolio and the fair value of each asset in the assets acquired through foreclosure category 
the most frequent forms of collateral for loans and foreclosed assets are income producing properties  business owned real estate and personal residences 
the value of such collateral is frequently verified through the use of outside appraisals 
appraisals of collateral  together with the value of guarantees and the worth of other collateral  are combined to recognize current losses  write downs of foreclosed assets  and to reserve for potential future losses

liquidity as required by the ots  institutions under its supervision must maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of cash and qualified assets to net withdrawable deposits and borrowings due within one year 
the liquidity ratios of the bank were and at december  and  respectively 
management monitors liquidity daily and maintains funding sources to meet unforeseen changes in cash requirements 
it is the policy of the bank to maintain cash and investments at least slightly above required levels 
the corporation s primary financing sources are deposits  repayments of loans and investment securities  sales of loans and borrowings 
in addition  the corporation s liquidity requirements can be accomplished through the use of its borrowing capacity from the fhlb of pittsburgh  the sale of certain securities and the pledging of certain loans for other lines of credit 
management believes these sources are sufficient to maintain the required and prudent levels of liquidity 
at december  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million  respectively 
the corporation routinely enters into commitments requiring the future outlay of funds 
effective march   the bank entered into a new year agreement with its data processing facilities management company 
under the terms of this agreement  an average minimum payment of approximately million per year for and has been committed 
the aforementioned commitment  as well as loan commitments  are expected to be met through traditional funding sources  such as deposits  short term borrowings  advances from the fhlb and principal repayments on loans and investments 
during  financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of million while operating and investing activities used million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional borrowings from the fhlb and increases in demand and savings deposits 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as the repayment of other borrowings  and a net increase in loan volume 
in  operating and financing activities provided million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from additional fhlb advances  increases in demand and time deposits  and the issuance of trust preferred securities 
this cash was utilized to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as the repayment of other borrowings  and a net increase in vehicles under operating leases 
during  the operating and financing activities provided million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  while investing activities used million 
the funds provided by financing activities reflect the additional fhlb advances and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
this cash was used to fund the purchase of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  as well as for the repayment of other borrowings and a net increase in assets leased to others 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as the bank to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   the bank is classified as well capitalized and is in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
management anticipates that the bank will continue to be classified as well capitalized 
for additional information concerning the bank s regulatory capital compliance see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of capital management  the corporation from time to time purchases its own shares of common stock to be included in its treasury 
since  the board of directors has approved four separate stock repurchase programs to reacquire common stock outstanding 
as part of these programs  the corporation acquired million shares in   shares in  million shares in and  shares in at december   the corporation held million shares of its common stock in the treasury 
the corporation may continue repurchasing shares in impact of inflation and changing prices the corporation s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of the corporation s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the corporation are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the corporation s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
accounting developments in june the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended in july by sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the derivative and the resulting designation 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of certain foreign currency exposures 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company has determined that the impact of this statement  including its provisions for the potential reclassifications of investment securities  on operations  financial condition and equity  will not have a material impact 
year banking  by its nature  is a very data processing intensive industry 
year issues resulted from the inability of many computer programs or computerized equipment to accurately calculate  store or use a calendar date after december  these potential shortcomings could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operation  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  calculate interest payments  track important customer information  provide convenient access to this information  or engage in normal business operations 
as a result of the rollover to the year  wsfs experienced no significant technological related problems and more importantly no adverse customer impact 
there remain however  some critical dates that could affect future computer operations 
these dates include march  and december   which are the first times that quarterly and yearly information will be processed 
while there can be no assurances that these dates will be handled properly  given the successful rollover to the year and our plan to effectively manage the remaining critical dates  management believes wsfs is well prepared to handle all remaining year issues 
wsfs is subject to the regulation and supervision of various banking regulators  whose oversight includes providing specific timetables  programs and guidance regarding year issues 
regulatory examination of the wsfs year programs were conducted periodically and reports are submitted by the bank to the banking regulators and the board of directors on a periodic basis 
from a technology perspective  wsfs uses application software systems and receives technical support from one of the world s largest data processing providers to financial institutions  for nearly its entire critical customer accounting applications 
this company has extensive resources dedicated at their corporate level to assist their financial institution customers  including wsfs  in the effort to become year compliant 
from a cost perspective  wsfs was already involved in upgrading its technology infrastructure and therefore  many potential year issues were avoided by the replacement of old systems with new technology 
wsfs approach to the year issue was to develop an effective plan and monitor progress closely  thereby minimizing exposure to adverse customer and shareholder impact while satisfying all regulatory requirements 
as of december   wsfs had incurred million in expenses related to the year issue and anticipates spending an additional  in future periods 
a large portion of costs associated with year issues was met from existing resources through a reprioritization of the technology department initiatives with the remainder representing incremental costs
