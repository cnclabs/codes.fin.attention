new accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements of the company 
funds from operations and cash available for distribution historical funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined to mean net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
cash available for distribution cad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations and loan amortization payments 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo and cad should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo and cad for the years ended december   and presented on a historical basis are summarized in the following table calculations of funds from operations and cash available for distribution year ended december  net income available to common shareholders    extraordinary item  net of minority interest minority interest    net gain loss on sale of assets   loss on unused treasury locks  loss on relocation of corporate office  adjusted net income    depreciation of real estate assets    funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    non recurring capital expenditures   loan amortization payments cash available for distribution    revenue generating capital expenditures    cash flow provided from used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average common shares outstanding basic    weighted average common shares outstanding diluted    weighted average common shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average common shares and units outstanding diluted    the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo which was adopted for periods beginning after january  ffo for any period means the consolidated net income available to common shareholders of the company and its subsidiaries for such period excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
nareit s definition of ffo excludes items classified by gaap as extraordinary or unusual and significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of performance over time 
effective january  nareit amended its definition of ffo to include in ffo all non recurring events  except for those that are defined as extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of property 
the company will use the amended definition of ffo in reporting results for all periods on or after january  the company does not expect use of the amended definition to materially affect ffo 
recurring capital expenditures consisted primarily of   and  of carpet replacement and   and  of other community additions and improvements to existing communities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since the company does not add back the depreciation of non real estate assets in its calculation of ffo  capital expenditures of   and  are excluded from the calculation of cad for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non recurring capital expenditures consisted of the additions of vehicle access control gates to communities of  and and other community additions and improvements of   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue generating capital expenditures included major renovations of communities in the amount of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and submetering of water service to communities in the amounts of  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively
