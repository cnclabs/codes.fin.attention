item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a radioactive and hazardous waste management company that offers comprehensive treatment solutions for llrw  llmw and other waste generated by the dod  doe and commercial entities such as nuclear power plants  medical facilities and research institutions 
the company principally derives its revenue from the waste treatment operations of its fixed facilities group and the on site remediation services of its field engineering group

gross profit margins are generally higher for technology transfer agreements involving up front  non refundable  licensing fees payable to the company  and due to the extensive expertise the company has developed in this area  when the company is processing radioactive waste  while margins on nonradioactive waste projects generally are lower 
in  the company focused a significant portion of its business on safglas tm vitrification of llrw  on its newly acquired tennessee business interests and llmw processing  and intends to continue this focus in during the company focused a significant portion of its business on safglas tm vitrification of llrw 
during the company entered into two technology transfer agreements with licensees in selected asian territories and intends to continue to seek additional such licensing arrangements as appropriate opportunities arise 
the company operates its fixed facilities under regulation of  and licenses and permits issued by  various federal  state and local agencies 
there can be no assurance as to the successful outcome of any pending licensing and permitting efforts 
the licensing and permitting process is subject to regulatory approval  time delays  community opposition and potentially stricter governmental regulation 
the company s inability to obtain licenses or permits on a timely basis  delays or changes in facility construction programs or the cancellation of pending projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has historically relied upon the integration of proven technologies with the company s know how and processes  and has not incurred significant levels of research and development spending 
most of the research and development activities conducted to date have related to the design and construction of its fixed operating facilities  particularly in connection with the safglas tm system

the company currently focuses on large  multi year site specific and term contracts in the areas of llrw and llmw treatment  environmental restoration and d d  and has in recent years been awarded a number of large government term contracts which  in most cases  require several years to complete 
these government term contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification at the sole option of the government at any time  to annual funding limitations and public sector budget constraints and  in many cases  to actual delivery orders being released 
such projects  which may create an opportunity for the company to realize margins higher than on other types of contracts  also impose heightened risks of loss if  for example  actual costs are higher than those estimated at the time of bid 
a loss on one or more of such larger contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  failure to obtain  or delay in obtaining  targeted large  multi year contracts could result in significantly less revenue to the company than anticipated
