overview medicis is a specialty pharmaceutical company and the leading independent pharmaceutical company in the united states focusing primarily on the treatment of dermatological conditions 
the company offers prescription products and an over the counter otc product  emphasizing the clinical effectiveness  quality  affordability and cosmetic elegance of its products 
medicis develops and markets leading products for major segments within dermatology  including acne  rosacea  antifungals  eczema  hyperpigmentation  pediculosis head lice  psoriasis  seborrheic dermatitis  and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
medicis has built its business by successfully executing a four part growth strategy 
the company s growth strategy includes expanding sales of existing brands  launching new products from intensive research and development efforts  acquiring complementary strategic products  businesses and technologies  and collaborating with other companies 
the company s primary products include the prescription brands dynacin minocycline hcl  triaz benzoyl peroxide  loprox ciclopirox  lustra and lustra af hydroquinone  ovide malathion  plexion sodium sulfacetamide sulfur  lidex fluocinonide  synalar fluocinolone acetonide  topicort desoximetasone  buphenyl sodium phenylbutyrate  a prescription product indicated in the treatment of urea cycle disorder  and the over the counter brand esoterica 
medicis derives a majority of its revenue from sales of its dynacin  triaz  lidex  loprox  lustra  lustra af and topicort products the key products 
the company believes that sales of the key products will constitute the majority of net revenues for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting the sale of the key products  individually or collectively  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of the key products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by regulatory or competitive changes 
the sale of the key products could also be adversely affected by other factors  including manufacturing or supply interruptions  the development of new competitive pharmaceuticals to treat the conditions addressed by the key products  technological advances  factors affecting the cost of production  marketing or pricing actions by one or more of the company s competitors  regulatory action by the fda  changes in the prescribing practices of dermatologists  changes in the reimbursement policies of third party payors  product liability claims  the outcome of disputes relating to trademarks  patents and other rights  or other factors 
the company s results of operations may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors  including expenditures incurred to acquire  license and promote pharmaceuticals  expenditures and timing relating to the acquisition and integration of businesses  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  cost increases from third party manufacturers  manufacturing and supply interruptions  the availability and cost of raw materials  the mix of products sold by the company  changes in marketing and sales expenditures  market acceptance of the company s products  competitive pricing pressures  the outcome of disputes relating to trademarks  patents and other rights  general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand  and the company s level of research and development activities 
in addition  the company s business has historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations  with lower sales generally being experienced in the first quarter of each fiscal year 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of the company s revenues has been in the last month of each quarter 
the company schedules its inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by the company could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
the company s operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
medicis recognizes revenues from sales upon shipment to its customers 
at the time of sale  the company records reserves for returns based upon estimates using historical experience 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated product returns and net of pricing adjustments and or discounts 
the company applies royalty obligations to the cost of sales in the period the corresponding sales are recognized 
the company s customers include the nation s leading wholesale pharmaceutical distributors  such as mckesson hboc  inc mckesson  bergen brunswig corporation bergen brunswig  cardinal health  inc cardinal  bindley western industries  inc bindley  quality king quality king and other major drug chains 
during fiscal  cardinal  mckesson  quality king and bergen brunswig accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s sales 
during fiscal  mckesson and cardinal accounted for and  respectively  of the company s sales 
during fiscal  mckesson  bergen brunswig and cardinal  accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s sales 
the loss of any of these customers accounts could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company plans to spend substantial amounts of capital to continue the acquisition of and the research and development of pharmaceutical products 
actual expenditures will depend upon the company s financial condition  as well as the results of clinical testing  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  and strategic marketing decisions 
the company may increase total expenditures for research and development and expects that research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
the company can give no assurance that the research and development projects will provide technologies or products that will be patentable  commercially feasible or acceptable to government agencies whose approval may be necessary 
the company intends to seek additional acquisitions of products or companies to leverage its existing distribution channels and marketing infrastructure  to provide additional opportunities for growth  and to aggressively market formulations of existing products 
the company is also seeking licensing opportunities 
the company can give no assurance that opportunities will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
to enable medicis to focus on its core marketing and sales activities  the company selectively out sources certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as laboratory research  manufacturing and warehousing 
as the company expands its activities in these areas  additional financial resources are expected to be utilized 
the company typically does not enter into long term manufacturing contracts with third party manufacturers 
whether or not such contracts exist  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate supplies of such products in a timely fashion  on acceptable terms  or at all 
the success of the company s efforts is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including dependence on sales of the key products  integration of new product acquisitions  risks associated with the genderm corporation and subsidiaries genderm acquisition  reliance upon third party manufacturers to produce certain key products  the ability to effectively manage a changing business  uncertainties related to pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement  and the uncertainty of competitive forces within the pharmaceutical industry that affects both the market for its product  and the availability of product lines for acquisitions that meet the company s acquisition or licensing criteria 
the future results of operations  both annually and from quarter to quarter  are subject to a variety of factors applicable to the company and to the industries and markets in which it operates
