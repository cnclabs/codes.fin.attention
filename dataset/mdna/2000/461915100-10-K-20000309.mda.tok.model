item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  investors bank trust company and investors capital services  inc  provides global custody  multicurrency accounting  institutional transfer agency  performance measurement  foreign exchange  securities lending  mutual fund administration and investment advisory services to a variety of financial asset managers  including mutual fund complexes  investment advisors  banks and insurance companies 
the company provides financial asset administration services for net assets that totaled approximately billion at december   including approximately billion of foreign net assets 
the company also engages in private banking transactions  including secured lending and deposit accounts 
on may  the company acquired amt capital services  inc and an affiliated company amt capital  a new york based firm recognized for providing fund administration services to global and domestic institutional investment management firms 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of amt capital in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
upon completion of the acquisition  amt capital became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and was re named investors capital services  inc on april    of the shares issued by the company were returned to the company pursuant to the indemnification and escrow provisions of the acquisition agreement 
on october   the bank acquired the domestic institutional trust and custody business the business of bankboston  na under the terms of the purchase agreement  the bank paid approximately million to bankboston as of the closing and paid an additional amount of approximately million in february based upon client retention and business performance 
the business provides master trust and custody services to endowments  pension funds  municipalities  mutual funds and other financial institutions  primarily in new england 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in connection with the acquisition  the bank and bankboston also entered into an outsourcing agreement 
pursuant to the outsourcing agreement  the bank acted as custodian  and provided certain other services  for three bankboston asset management related businesses domestic private banking  institutional asset management and international private banking 
in september  the bank received notification from bankboston of its intent to terminate the outsourcing agreement 
the termination  to be effective in early  will have no impact on the remaining business purchased from bankboston 
pursuant to the terms of the outsourcing agreement  the bank received a termination fee of million in february therefore  a net adjustment to decrease the purchase price  resulting from the two above mentioned items  was made for million 
the bank does not anticipate a material impact on net income due to the termination of the outsourcing agreement 
the bank was informed by bankboston that its decision to terminate the outsourcing agreement was not related in any way to the company s quality of service but was made as part of the integration process undertaken in connection with the recently completed bankboston fleet merger 
on february   the board of directors of the company declared a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable march  to stockholders of record on march  all share numbers shown in this annual report have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split paid march  where applicable 
on march   the company completed the issuance and sale of  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement to one investor 
the net capital raised in the private placement was used to support the company s balance sheet growth 
on october   the bank entered into an agreement with sanwa bank california  pursuant to which the bank agreed to purchase the right to provide institutional custody and related services to accounts managed by the trust company of the west 
the accounts subject to the agreement totaled approximately billion in assets at october  the bank expects to complete the purchase by march   subject to customary closing conditions 
the company s current largest client  eaton vance  accounted for  and of the company s net operating revenues for the years ended december   and respectively 
the company believes its relationship with eaton vance is good and expects it to continue 
the company s agreements with mutual funds managed by eaton vance  pursuant to which the company provides custody and fund accounting services  extend through august and continue thereafter until terminated by either party upon sixty days prior notice 
the company derives its revenues from financial asset administration services and private banking transactions 
although interest income and non interest income are reported separately for financial statement presentation purposes  the company s clients view the pricing of the company s asset administration and banking service offerings on a bundled basis 
in establishing a fee structure for a specific client  management analyzes all expected revenue and related expenses  as opposed to separately analyzing fee income and interest income and related expenses for each from such relationship 
accordingly  management believes net operating revenue net interest income plus non interest income and net income are the most meaningful measures of financial results 
revenue generated from asset administration and other fees and interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non interest income consists primarily of fees for financial asset administration and is principally derived from custody  multicurrency accounting  transfer agency and administration services for financial asset managers and the assets they control 
the company s clients pay fees based on the volume of assets under custody  the number of securities held and portfolio transactions  income collected and whether other value added services such as foreign exchange  securities lending and performance measurement are needed 
asset based fees are usually charged on a sliding scale 
as such  when the assets in a portfolio under custody grow as a result of changes in market values or cash inflows  the company s fees may be a smaller percentage of those assets 
fees for individually managed accounts  such as custodial  trust and portfolio accounting services for individuals  investment advisors  private trustees  financial planners  other banks and fiduciaries  and other institutions are also included in non interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income generated from interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest bearing liabilities are generated by the company s clients who  in the course of their financial asset management  generate cash balances  which they deposit on a short term basis with the company 
the company invests these cash balances and remits a portion of the earnings on these investments to its clients 
the company s share of earnings from these investments is viewed as part of the total package of compensation paid to the company from its clients for performing asset administration services 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the sec including this form k may contain statements  which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements in this form k include certain statements regarding liquidity  the effects of bankboston s termination of the outsourcing agreement  customary closing conditions relating to the sanwa bank transaction and the effect of certain potential legal claims against the company 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
each of these factors  and others  are discussed from time to time in the company s filings with the sec 
the company s future results may be subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
the company s liquidity is dependent  in part  upon the continued availability of current borrowing facilities  the loss of which may impair the company s access to liquid funds 
because certain fees charged by the company for its services are based on the market values of assets processed  such fees and the company s quarterly and annual operating results are sensitive to changes in interest rates  declines in stock market values  and investors seeking alternatives to the investment offerings of the company s clients 
also  the company s interest related services  along with the market value of the company s investments  may be adversely affected by rapid changes in interest rates or changes in the relationship between certain index rates 
in addition  many of the company s client engagements are  and in the future are likely to continue to be  terminable upon days notice 
if the company is not able to recognize expense reduction or reallocation of resources after the termination of the outsourcing agreement  the termination may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
also  the outcome of any legal claim against the company cannot be predicted with certainty and  even if the company is successful in defending or settling any claims  the existence of the claims may harm the company s reputation or ability to add new clients 
the company has been experiencing a period of rapid growth  which places a strain on all of its resources  including management 
in addition  the company must integrate future acquisitions  if any  into the company s business 
also  the company must continue to attract and retain skilled personnel in a tight labor market 
in particular  the current market for financial services employees is extremely competitive 
if the company fails to manage growth effectively  integrate acquisitions successfully or attract and retain skilled employees  it could reduce the quality of the company s services  lead to loss of key employees and clients  and have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of the company s intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of those rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the segment of the financial services industry in which the company is engaged is extremely competitive 
certain current and potential competitors of the company are more established and benefit from greater market recognition and have substantially greater financial  development and marketing resources than the company 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the timing of the commencement or termination of client engagements  the rate of net inflows and outflows of investor funds in the debt and equity based investment vehicles offered by the company s clients  fluctuations in global equity and debt markets  the introduction and market acceptance of new services by the company and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
because the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenues in a specified period may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations for that period 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  operating results and stock price 
statement of operations comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and non interest income non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non interest income consists of the following items for the year ended december  change dollars in thousands asset administration fees   computer service fees other operating income net gain loss on sale of securities total non interest income   asset administration fees increased million due principally to higher levels of assets processed resulting from the addition of new clients as well as the expansion of existing client relationships

the acquisition of bankboston s institutional trust and custody business was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and as a result  the purchase price was allocated first to all identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the remainder of the purchase price excess of purchase price over the fair value of intangible net assets was then allocated to goodwill 
goodwill expense relates to the amortization of the resulting goodwill from the acquisition  which is being amortized over its estimated useful life 
in september  the bank received notification of bankboston s intent to terminate the outsourcing agreement 
the termination  expected to be effective in early  will have no impact on the remaining business purchased from bankboston 
pursuant to the terms of the outsourcing agreement  the bank received a termination fee of million in february the bank does not anticipate a material impact on net income due to the termination 
the bank was informed by bankboston that its decision to terminate the outsourcing agreement was not related in anyway to the company s quality of service  but was made as part of the integration process undertaken in connection with the bankboston fleet merger

other operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses include fees for office supplies  recruiting costs  temporary help and various fees assessed by the massachusetts banking commission 
recruiting costs accounted for  of the increase due to the growth of the company s staffing needs 
the growth in assets processed has resulted in an overall increase in operating expenses 
net interest income net interest income is the amount of interest received on interest earning assets less the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  and the movement and level of interest rates 
the table below presents the changes in net interest income resulting from changes in the volume of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  changes attributed to both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category

the overall effective tax rate for the period was which compares to for the prior year 
the period over period increase was due to the change in tax status from an s corporation to a c corporation of investors capital services  inc financial condition investment portfolio the following table summarizes the company s investment portfolio as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands securities held to maturity mortgage backed securities    federal agency securities    state and political subdivisions    foreign government securities    total securities held to maturity    securities available for sale mortgage backed securities    federal agency securities  corporate debt   state and political subdivisions    us treasury securities  total securities available for sale    the investment portfolio is used to invest depositors funds and provide a secondary source of earnings for the company 
in addition  the company uses the investment portfolio to secure open positions at securities clearing institutions in connection with its custody services 
the portfolio is comprised of securities of state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed securities issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac  and federal agency callable bonds issued by fhlmc and the fhlbb  municipal securities  corporate debt securities  and foreign government bonds issued by the canadian provinces of ontario and manitoba 
the company invests in mortgage backed securities  federal agency callable bonds and corporate debt to increase the total return of the investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and prepayment risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty is unable to meet the terms of the contract 
prepayment risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates may cause mortgage securities to be paid off prior to their maturity dates 
federal agency callable bonds generally have a higher yield than us treasury securities due to credit and call risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that the federal agency issuing the bonds may be unable to meet the terms of the bond 
call risk results from the possibility that fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in the exercise of the call option by the federal agency 
credit risk related to mortgage backed securities and federal agency callable bonds is substantially reduced by payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
the company invests in municipal securities to generate stable  tax advantaged income 
municipal securities generally have lower stated yields than federal agency and us treasury securities  but the after tax yields are comparable 
municipal securities are subject to credit risk 
the company invests in foreign government bonds in order to generate foreign source income to maximize the use of the foreign tax credit 
the foreign government bonds are denominated in us dollars to avoid foreign currency risk 
these bonds are subject to credit risk 
the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities held to maturity at december  are reflected in the following table 
years under to to over amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield mortgage backed securities     federal agency securities    state and political subdivisions   foreign government securities  total securities held to maturity     the book value and weighted average yield of the company s securities available for sale at december  are reflected in the following table

the unsecured lines of credit may  in the event of a default  be collateralized at the company s option by securities held in custody by the company for those mutual funds 
loans to mutual funds also include advances by the company to certain mutual fund clients pursuant to the terms of the custody agreements between the company and those clients 
at december   the company s only lending concentrations which exceeded of total loans were the revolving lines of credit to mutual fund clients discussed above 
these loans were made in the ordinary course of business on the same terms and conditions prevailing at the time for comparable transactions 
the company s credit loss experience has been excellent 
there have been no loan chargeoffs or adverse credit actions in the history of the company 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on non accrual status when either principal or interest becomes days past due and the loan s collateral is not sufficient to cover both principal and accrued interest 
as of december   there were no past due loans  troubled debt restructurings  or any loans on non accrual status 
although virtually all of the company s loans are fully collateralized with freely tradable securities  management recognizes some credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and has recorded an allowance for loan losses of  at december  this amount is not allocated to any particular loan  but is intended to absorb any risk of loss inherent in the loan portfolio 
management actively monitors the loan portfolio and the underlying collateral and regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
market risk overview the active management of market risk is integral to the company s operations 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
the company administers and oversees the investment risk management process primarily through two oversight bodies the board of directors and the asset and liability committee alco 
the company s board of directors reviews  on a quarterly basis  the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the alco committee is a senior management committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief financial officer  the executive vice president and members of the treasury function and others who are responsible for the day to day management of market risk 
alco meets on a bi weekly basis to provide detailed oversight of investment risk  including market risk 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
the company has investment guidelines that define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountabilities and controls over these activities 
in addition  the company also has specific investment policies that delineate investment limits and strategies that are appropriate  given liquidity  surplus and regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  the financial position of the company is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risks associated with interest rate movements 
the company regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
the company recognizes that effective management of interest rate risk includes an understanding of when adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the statement of income and comprehensive income 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
in order to manage this interest rate risk  the company has established that it will follow a policy limit stating that projected net interest income over the next months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points or over months 
the bank s primary tool in managing interest rate risk in this manner is an income simulation model wherein the company projects the future net interest income derived from the most current projected balance sheet using a variety of interest rates scenarios 
the model seeks to adjust for cash flow changes arising from the changing interest rates for mortgage prepayments  callable securities and adjustable rate securities 
the company also utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swap contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on an underlying interest rate index 
the effect of these agreements was to lengthen short term variable rate liabilities into longer term fixed rate liabilities 
for instance  in as interest rates rose in sympathy with the federal reserve actions  prepayment cash flow diminished raising the effective return on certain investment portfolio holdings 
the results of the sensitivity analysis as of december  and december   indicated that an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and respectively  versus the policy limit of 
conversely  a downward shift of basis points would result in an increase in projected net interest income of and respectively 
during  the company took advantage of the steepening yield curve to acquire intermediate fixed rate investments to protect against a falling or flattening yield curve 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yield and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
assumptions are the underlying factors that drive the interest rate risk measurement system which include interest rate forecasts  client liability funding  mortgage prepayment assumptions and portfolio yields 
the model assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period will change periodically over the period being measured 
the model also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the model provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors  quarterly 
market risk re pricing risk the company  like all financial intermediaries  is subject to several types of interest rate risk 
rapid changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the company by causing changes in the market value of the company s assets and its net interest income 
repricing risk arises when an earning asset matures or when its rate of interest changes in a time frame different from that of the supporting interest bearing liability 
by seeking to minimize the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that could experience changes in interest rates in the same time frame  the company attempts to reduce the risk of significant adverse effects on net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
the company does not attempt to match each earning asset with a specific interest bearing liability 
instead  as shown in the table below  it aggregates all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to determine the difference between these in specific time frames 
this difference is known as the rate sensitivity gap 
a positive gap indicates that more earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature in a time frame  and a negative gap indicates the opposite 
maintaining a balanced position will reduce risk associated with interest rate changes  but it will not guarantee a stable interest rate spread because the various rates within a time frame may change by differing amounts and change in different directions 
the company seeks to manage interest rate risk by investment portfolio actions designed to address the interest rate sensitivity of asset cash flows in relation to liability cash flows 
portfolio actions used to manage interest rate risk include managing the effective duration of the portfolio securities and utilizing interest rate swaps 
interest rate contracts are used to hedge against large rate swings and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge against rising interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company s current strategy is to use such contracts to offset increases in interest expense related to customer deposits and other client funding sources including repurchase agreements 
interest rate contracts involve elements of credit and market risk  which are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such instruments are entered into for hedging as opposed to investment or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company periodically monitors the financial stability of its counterparties according to prudent investment guidelines and established procedures 
there can be no assurance that such portfolio actions will adequately limit interest rate risk
