part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and has the largest sales volume worldwide 
the company is the only integrated producer with major titanium processing facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
the demand for titanium reached a peak in when worldwide mill products shipments reached  metric tons 
since this peak  annual shipments declined to  metric tons in and a further to  metric tons in the company estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of world sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in diverse uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive and architectural uses 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
the company believes it is among the lower cost producers of titanium sponge and melt products due in part to its economies of scale  manufacturing expertise and investment in technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like the company  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company believes that at least of the world s titanium sponge is produced by six companies 
the company intends to continue its focus on the following long term goals and objectives to change the traditional way business is conducted o maximize the long term value of its core aerospace business by focusing on the company s basic strengths of sponge production  melting and forging of various shapes of titanium products  and by entering into strategic agreements with major titanium users to help mitigate the cyclicality of the company s aerospace business 
o invest in strategic alliances  including joint ventures  acquisitions and entrepreneurial arrangements  as well as new markets  applications and products  to help reduce traditional dependence on the aerospace sector 
o invest in technology  capacity and innovative projects aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity  quality  customer service and production capabilities 
o stabilize the cost and supply of raw materials 
o maintain a strong balance sheet 
the company s focus in the short term is to return to profitability as quickly as possible by reducing costs  improving quality and streamlining its overall business and manufacturing processes 
to that end  the company has o limited planned capital expenditures to include those principally intended for capital maintenance  environmental  health and safety purposes 
o rationalized staffing and production worldwide to fit current market conditions 
o suspended the dividend on its common stock 
o negotiated new credit agreements to provide liquidity through the current down cycle 
o initiated a plan to reduce overhead  inventory and receivables 
the company intends to consider further means to reduce costs if the foregoing do not prove sufficient to return to profitability 
current industry conditions and outlook for the titanium industry historically has derived the majority of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the historical fluctuations in performance of titanium companies  which had cyclical peaks in mill products shipments in  and and cyclical lows in and during the period  the company reported aggregate net income of million  which substantially more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult period 
the company currently expects that the loss in will exceed the loss and looks to return to profitability in late worldwide industry mill products shipments of approximately  metric tons in were above levels 
in  industry mill product shipments declined approximately  to approximately  metric tons  with a further decline to approximately  metric tons in expectations for are a further decline in mill product shipments although it is expected to be less than the decline as experienced during each of the last two years 
the company believes that the reduction in demand for aerospace products is attributable to a decline in the number of aircraft forecast to be produced  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes  compounded by reductions in inventories throughout the aerospace industry supply chain as customers adjust to the decreases in overall production rates 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components such as rotor blades  discs  rings and engine cases  and air frame components  such as bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear and wing supports  can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
industry shipments to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of total aerospace demand of total titanium demand 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of over billion estimated in  compared to billion in each of and the company believes that commercial aircraft deliveries peaked in current expected deliveries for and  while below the record levels of and  are still high by historical standards  and the current generations of airplanes use substantially more titanium than their predecessors 
the demand for titanium generally precedes aircraft deliveries by about a year  which results in the company s cycle preceding that of the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will result in demand for titanium products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded 
existing industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in diverse uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive and architectural uses 
several of these are emerging applications and represent potential growth opportunities that the company believes may reduce the industry s historical dependence on the aerospace market 
the business environment in which timet finds itself in remains very different from during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
during  aerospace customers continued to reduce inventories  and customers and end users continue to indicate that a substantial inventory overhang exists 
as a result  a significant number of the company s major aerospace customers canceled or delayed previously scheduled orders 
most importantly  timet believes orders under the company s long term contract with the boeing company boeing were significantly below the contractual volume requirements for although boeing has informed the company that it will either order the required contractual volume under the contract in or pay the liquidated damages provided for in the agreement  timet has received virtually no boeing related orders under the contract for the year boeing has also informed the company that it is unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year  and timet has filed a lawsuit against boeing for repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
these factors lead timet to believe that year sales will be somewhat lower than the fourth quarter annualized amount 
adding to the challenges in the aerospace sector  industrial demand for titanium remains soft due to the weakness in asian and other economies 
assuming overall market demand remains at currently expected levels  which is lower than  the company currently expects operating and net losses in each quarter of in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts referred to below are expected to cause sales  gross margin and operating income excluding special charges to be lower in than in in the fourth quarter of and january timet began implementing a plan of action designed to address current market conditions without abandoning key elements of its long term strategy  which it believes remain sound 
the action plan entails the following o timet s global manufacturing operations and commercial operations have been consolidated into two organizations with personnel reductions of about people compared to year end levels 
this comes on top of a reduction of approximately people during and o timet will focus significant efforts in improving manufacturing performance 
considerable resources will be devoted to continuous improvement programs to improve the quality of manufacturing  customer service and management processes 
o reductions in plant overhead costs as well as in selling and administrative costs have been targeted 
o supply contracts with key vendors have been renegotiated in order to reduce volumes and  to some extent  prices 
similar efforts will continue throughout o capital expenditures will be reduced from levels 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in  compared to approximately million in and an aggregate of approximately million in and in addition to its short term plan of actions as described above  the company has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company 
these agreements provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
the contracts were structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of the company s long term aerospace strategy 
these agreements should limit pricing volatility both up and down for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
the boeing contract requires boeing to purchase a minimum percentage of their titanium requirements from timet 
although boeing placed orders and accepted delivery of certain volumes in  timet believes the level of orders was significantly below the contractual volume requirements for although boeing has informed the company that it will either order the required contractual volume under the contract in or pay the liquidated damages provided for in the agreement  timet has received virtually no boeing related orders under the contract for the year boeing has also informed the company that it is unwilling to commit to the contract beyond the year on march   the company filed a lawsuit against boeing in a colorado state court seeking damages for boeing s repudiation and breach of the boeing contract 
timet s complaint seeks damages from boeing that timet believes are in excess of million and a declaration from the court of timet s rights under the contract 
as a complement to the long term agreements entered into with the company s key customers  the company has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that were intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for the company s key customers 
primarily because of the lack of boeing orders  the order flow did not meet expectations in  therefore  the company restructured the terms of certain agreements 
acquisitions and capital transactions during the past three years 
during  the company entered into a welded tube joint venture valtimet intended to combine best manufacturing practices and market coverage in this market 
in  timet i acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  particularly oil and gas  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe  ii purchased for cash million of non voting preferred securities of special metals corporation  a us manufacturer of wrought nickel based superalloys and special alloy long products  and iii entered into a castings joint venture with wyman gordon 
in january  the company sold its interest in the castings joint venture 
these transactions are more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge to pretax earnings for the write down associated with the company s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  tremont corporation purchased additional timet common stock in market transactions 
in  tremont exercised an option to purchaseapproximately two million shares of the company s common stock 
at march   tremont held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock 
an additional of timet s outstanding common stock is owned by the combined master retirement trust  a trust formed by valhi  inc  an affiliate of tremont  to permit the collective investment by trusts that maintain the assets of certain employee benefit plans adopted by valhi and related entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
in  virtually all of timet s sales were generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nevada  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip  welded pipe  pipe fittings  extrusions and wire 
the company sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to the company s service centers 
the company s customers usually process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of products  the company performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
the company is dependent upon the services of outside processors to perform important processing functions with respect to certain of its products 
in particular  the company currently relies upon a single processor to perform certain rolling steps with respect to some of its plate  sheet and strip products 
although the company believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
the company is exploring ways to lessen its dependence on any individual processor 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
the company processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
during  approximately of the company s production was made from internally produced sponge  from purchased sponge  from titanium scrap and from alloying elements 
while the company is one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a portion of its sponge needs in based upon the company s evaluation of the relative cost of raw materials and the technical requirements of its customers  the company expects the mix of raw materials in to be internally produced sponge  purchased sponge  scrap and alloying elements 
sponge producers in japan and kazakhstan are expected to supply all of the company s sponge purchases in timet has a long term agreement  concluded in  for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
this sponge purchase agreement is for ten years  with firm pricing for the first five years subject to certain possible adjustments 
this contract provides for annual purchases by the company of  to  metric tons 
the parties agreed to reduced minimums for and due to the decrease in demand for titanium  the company has abandoned its plans to purchase on a long term basis premium quality sponge produced in japan 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  africa south africa and sierra leone  india and the united states 
a majority of the company s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
in addition  although the company believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single source near the company s plant  but alternative suppliers are available 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
markets and customer base 
about of the company s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
while no customer accounts for more than of the company s direct sales in  about of the company s mill product sales were used by the company s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
the company has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  which accounted for approximately of aerospace sales in the company expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace sector  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft boeing commercial airplane group and the airbus consortium and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
the company s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during although the company believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect the company s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of through various strategic relationships  the company seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  former soviet union fsu and china 
the company is one of five integrated producers in the world  with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
the company believes that most producers will continue to generally operate at lower capacity utilization levels in than in  increasing price competition 
the company s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny technologies inc  rti international metals  inc 
and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on the company has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
the gsp program has been renewed for two years and is scheduled to expire during the second quarter in  gsp benefits to these products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine had for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
titanium sponge imports from japan were also subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision  and the briefing of the appeal was concluded in the third quarter of a decision is expected during and until such decision is reached  the orders remain revoked 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
however  the company has  in recent years  been one of the largest importers of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent the company remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to the company for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward improving process technology  developing new alloys  enhancing the performance of the company s products in current applications  and searching for new uses of titanium products 
for example  aerospace applications continue to grow for some of the company s proprietary alloys such as timetal r s and timetal additionally  testing of alloys such as timetal lcb and timetal is increasing for new non aerospace applications 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nevada laboratory  which the company believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton  england facility 
patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
the company believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
the following table shows the significant reduction in the number of employees over the past years 
the reduction in employees from the peak in was in response to a reduction in market demand 
during  the company expects to reduce employment by an additional people  or approximately of timet s worldwide workforce 
the vast majority of the employee reductions are expected to occur during the first half of the year 
employees at december  us    europe  total    the company s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
negotiations with respect to the henderson contract are expected to begin during the third quarter of employees at the company s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
over of the salaried and hourly employees at the company s european facilities are represented by various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements  the majority of which are still under negotiation for the company expects to complete the negotiation of one year contracts in the uk and france that would include modest wage increases 
while the company currently considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
the company s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the following federal acts the clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at the company s henderson  nevada facility  the company uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
the company has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in the company s operations 
the company s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws 
the company s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  the company may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties 
the company incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental compliance matters of approximately million in each of  and and its capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately three fourths of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
during the second half of  it became evident to the company that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes 
during  aerospace customers reduced inventories and adjusted to decreases in overall production rates and  as a result  the company s mill products shipments declined to  metric tons 
the company s fourth quarter sales of million was the lowest quarterly sales amount in four years 
at present  a substantial inventory overhang still exists throughout the aerospace industry supply chain and current expectations are that sales will be somewhat below the fourth quarter annualized due to lower expected sales volumes and selling prices 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies and is expected to remain soft during the company estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons and decreased in to approximately  metric tons and decreased a further in to  metric tons 
expectations for are a further decline in mill product shipments although the decline is expected to be less than that experienced during each of the last two years 
the company s order backlog decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the year end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during the company expects that production levels  capacity utilization  sales volumes  sales prices  gross margins and operating income excluding special charges  will all be lower in than they were in accordingly  the company currently expects that its loss before special charges will exceed its loss before special charges and looks to return to profitability in late in january  the company adopted a plan to restructure the organization and reduce costs 
as part of this reorganization  the global manufacturing and commercial operations have been consolidated into two organizations  and the company will further reduce personnel by about  or employees  primarily during the first half of additional resources will be focused in an effort to significantly improve the quality of the company s manufacturing  customer service and management processes to return to profitability 
the restructuring actions taken in january are expected to result in an additional restructuring charge in the first quarter of of up to million  primarily related to employee termination costs 
additionally  in february  the company entered into new us and us credit facilities 
in connection therewith  the company wrote off million of deferred financing costs associated with its previous us facility 
sales and operating income loss compared with the titanium melted and mill product segment net sales in decreased compared to primarily due to a decrease in mill products shipment volume resulting primarily from reduced demand in the aerospace market  as described above 
average selling prices for were approximately lower than reflecting both the price effect of long term agreements and increased price competition on non contract business 
average prices on shipments are expected to be as much as lower than average in certain product lines  but only slightly lower than average prices in the fourth quarter of as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company produced approximately million of titanium ingot in  for which the customer was billed but income recognition was deferred 
the company anticipates the majority of this ingot will be converted and shipped in  at which time the related income will be recorded 
the decrease in net sales of the other segment is a result of the company s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total cost of sales in was of sales compared to in the increase in the percentage is a result of the lower selling prices  lower production volumes  higher depreciation  and increased reserves for slow moving inventory 
yield  rework and deviated material costs were also higher and plant operating rates were lower 
selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were lower than in dollar terms due in large part to the completion of the implementation of the initial phase of the company s business enterprise system during the first half of these costs as a percentage of sales  however  increased to approximately primarily due to the decline in sales 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million of special charges consisting of million of restructuring charges and million of write downs associated with the company s investment in certain start up joint ventures 
during the same quarter  the company also recorded a million charge to cost of sales for slow moving inventory 
approximately half of the restructuring charges were non cash  primarily related to the disposition of a germany subsidiary  with the cash component relating to the termination of people 
the million charge for slow moving inventory and million of the million of special charges are included in the operating loss of the titanium melted and mill products segment in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million 
operating losses of the other segment included million and million of special charges in and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment decreased by million from principally due to the decline in earnings of valtimet 
equity in losses of the other segment were higher in due to the company recording a higher share of the losses for a full year in as a result of increased ownership in certain of these ventures in mid sales and operating income compared with net sales of the titanium melted and mill products segment in were below levels primarily due to lower volumes from reduced demand during the last half of the year in both aerospace and industrial markets  as described above 
mill product shipment volume for the year declined to  metric tons 
selling prices on shipments were relatively flat  in large part due to prices on orders entered prior to the decline in demand 
net sales of the other segment were down primarily as a result of the company s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total cost of sales was of sales in  comparable to of sales in selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were higher than in  in both total dollar and percent of sales terms  up from  in large part due to information technology costs  including implementation of the company s business enterprise information system and addressing yk issues 
equity in earnings of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment improved in over principally due to improved earnings of valtimet 
equity losses of the other segment were higher in as certain ventures were held for the full year  compared to a part year in european operations 
the company has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing the company s us and european operations are substantially the same 
approximately of the company s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and european currencies tied to the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for the company s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of the company s european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
the company s export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and as such are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the us dollar sales and purchases of the company s european operations described above provide some natural hedge of non functional currencies  and the company does not use currency contracts to hedge its currency exposures 
net currency transaction gains losses included in earnings was a million loss in  a 
million gain in and nominal in at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of u 
s 
dollar cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and borrowings 
exchange rates among european currencies including the french franc  italian lira and german mark  but excluding the british pound became fixed relative to each other as a result of the implementation of the euro effective in costs associated with modifications of systems to handle euro denominated transactions were not significant 
dividends and interest income

see liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
general corporate income expense 
general corporate income expense consists principally of currency transaction gains losses 
interest expense 
interest expense for more than doubled from the levels of primarily due to higher levels of average debt and increased interest rates 
also contributing to the higher comparative interest expense is a lower level of interest being capitalized in compared to as major capital projects have been completed 
while average borrowing levels increased in over  interest rates declined and interest capitalized increased 
interest expense in is expected to be higher than due to higher average borrowing levels and higher interest rates on the new credit facilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by compagnie europeene du zirconium cezus  sa cezus 
income taxes 
the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income loss can impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
in  the company s income tax rate also varied from the us statutory rate due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes 
for financial reporting purposes  the company has recognized the tax benefit of all of its net operating loss carryforwards  and expects that tax benefits to be recognized during will be deferred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year yk 
as a result of many computer systems and applications being written to use two digit fields to designate a year  many date sensitive systems may have recognized the year as  or not at all 
this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing systems to incorrectly process critical financial  manufacturing and operational information
