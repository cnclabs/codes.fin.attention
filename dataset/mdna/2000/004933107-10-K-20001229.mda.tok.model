item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design and market licensed motorsports products  including die cast scaled replicas of motorsports vehicles  apparel  and souvenirs 
our vehicles are replicas of cars driven by individual drivers and are principally nascar and nhra replicas although such vehicles also include sprint car  cart and formula one replicas 
third parties manufacture all of our motorsports vehicles and most of our apparel and souvenirs  generally utilizing our designs  tools  and dies 
we screen print and embroider a portion of the apparel that we sell in our atlanta facility 
formula one vehicles and apparel are designed and marketed in our subsidiaries in germany and the united kingdom 
our company was incorporated in arizona in may and we began marketing die cast collectibles in july prior to fiscal  our revenue consisted primarily of sales of die cast vehicles 
during fiscal and we acquired companies that sold either die cast or other collectibles or licensed motorsports apparel and souvenirs 
as a result of these acquisitions and our subsequent efforts to develop new product lines and distribution channels  sales of collectible products represented approximately and of net sales in fiscal and and sales of apparel and souvenirs represented approximately and of net sales in such periods 
the following factors  among other factors  have an impact on our revenue the popularity and performance of drivers and teams under license  the popularity of motorsports and nascar in particular  and the general demand for licensed sports merchandise 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  royalty payments to licensors  and depreciation of tooling and dies 
significant factors affecting our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales include the overall percentage of net sales represented by sales of die cast collectible products  which typically carry higher gross margins than our other products  the percentage of sales of die cast collectible products represented by sales through the collectors club  which typically carry higher gross margins than sales of such products through wholesale distributors  and the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales 
in addition  product is purchased generally at prices intended to yield a specific margin 
our margins may vary  however  based upon higher than anticipated freight charges  additional charges related to order quantities  cancellation of specific purchase orders  and discounted sales 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenue represented by certain expense and revenue items

com internet strategy  costs associated with our reorganization in order to achieve a cost structure consistent with anticipated revenue volumes  and a strategic decision to focus on core drivers and core programs 
the loss includes special charges of million for the fourth quarter and million for the fiscal year as set forth below and in restructuring and other charges below 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million arising from our decision to abandon our goracing 
com internet strategy  including withdrawal of its initial public offering 
the charges include provisions for the write off of goodwill  endorsements and sponsorship commitments  and employee severance and termination costs 
in addition to the goracing 
com charge  we recorded other charges totaling approximately million in fiscal these charges are comprised of a million write down related to excess inventories based in part on anticipated sponsorships  driver and marketing programs which did not materialize  million of additional receivable reserves based on current information regarding the uncollectibility of certain customer account balances  a million provision for vendor discounts which were anticipated but not received due to lower than anticipated volumes  tooling write downs and amortization of million arising from a change in the estimated useful lives of tooling equipment and the write off of obsolete items  write downs of prepaid royalties and sponsorship fees of million  reflecting  in part  our decision to concentrate future production on core drivers and core programs  and approximately million in other asset impairments

net sales decreased to million in fiscal  a decline of from the million reported for fiscal the decrease reflected a general decline in sports licensed merchandise sales  a decline in the number of promotional programs  and a decline in sales for certain licensed products that had enjoyed materially increased sales in the previous year 
cost of sales for fiscal were million or of sales compared with million for fiscal or of sales 
before special charges  cost of sales was million or of sales 
this percentage was greater than the percentage for because of increased freight costs as a percentage of cost of sales  increased manufacturing costs due to change orders  and lower order quantities and sales of product at discounted prices 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million or of sales for fiscal compared with million for fiscal or of sales 
excluding special charges  such expenses were million for fiscal or of sales 
the increase before special charges of million for fiscal was principally due to the costs of operating goracing 
com prior to abandoning our internet strategy  the costs of operating fantasy sports  which was acquired in fiscal  and an increase in sponsorships and additional professional fees 
the percentage increase was also due to the reduction in sales volume without a corresponding reduction in such costs 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal excluding the special charge for the write off of the goracing 
com and simpson products  inc intangible  amortization was million for fiscal minority interest was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal  principally reflecting lower income from our owned german subsidiary 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal  representing of the pre tax  loss compared with a tax provision of million for fiscal  representing of the pre tax income 
the percentage income tax benefit for fiscal was less than the percentage tax provision for fiscal principally because of the special charges for the write off of intangibles that did not have a tax basis and because no benefit was recorded for state and federal tax jurisdictions 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september net sales increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  we attribute the improvement in sales during fiscal primarily to our ability to capitalize on the continued strong growth in the base of motorsports enthusiasts and to produce and sell increased quantities of souvenirs  apparel  and die cast collectible goods  additional revenue from promotional programs for die cast  apparel  and souvenirs  expanded sales through our retail trackside operations and mass retail channels  a full year s revenue from our international operations  and an increase in collectors club membership 
the number of members in the collectors club increased to approximately  members at september  from approximately  members at september  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from a greater economies of scale as a result of the larger production runs associated with the corporate promotional programs conducted during fiscal  which decreased costs of sales as a percentage of sales for those products  and b an increase in sales  as a percentage of total sales  of die cast products  which typically provide higher gross margins than our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  representing and of net sales  respectively 
the increase in such expenses as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from a development and other operating costs related to the launch of our internet operations in fiscal  b increased depreciation expenses of approximately million associated with capitalized costs added in fiscal and c increased expenses for facilities and personnel  particularly in our charlotte operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is related to an approximately  expense recorded in connection with the acquisitions of tech and goodsports during fiscal and an additional million of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our fiscal acquisitions  which were expensed over the entire year in fiscal we amortize the goodwill and other intangible assets over periods of three to years 
interest income expense and other  net  changed to a net expense of approximately million for fiscal from a net expense of approximately million for fiscal the change was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense of approximately million related to the convertible subordinated notes 
pro forma results of operations the following unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the years ended september  and present our results of operations as if the acquisition of fantasy sports had occurred as of october  pro forma results are as follows fiscal year ended september in thousands  except per share data net sales   net income loss   net income loss per common share  diluted quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the eight quarters in the fiscal years ended september  and all quarterly information was obtained from unaudited financial statements not otherwise contained in this report 
we believe that all necessary adjustments have been made to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

our cost of sales was million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales compared with million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales 
before special charges  fourth quarter cost of sales were million  or of sales 
the increase in the percentage of sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to increased freight costs and sales of product at discounted prices 
loss from operations reflects the factors described in footnote above as well as increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  or of sales  compared with million during fiscal  or of sales 
excluding special charges during fiscal  such expenses were million  or of sales 
the percentage increase was in part due to the reduction in sales without a corresponding reduction in such costs 
our revenue and operating results may be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors 
as a result of the fiscal and acquisitions  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our past financial results may not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
seasonality because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally are characterized by higher sales of motorsports products 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital position decreased to million at september  from million at september  the decrease of million is primarily attributable to cash used in operations  capital expenditures  including tooling of million  the cost of acquiring fantasy sports of million  the repurchase of common stock of million  royalty payments of million  and the cash component of special charges of million 
on march   we sold million of convertible subordinated notes due the subordinated notes are convertible  at the option of the holders  into shares of common stock at the initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments in certain events 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april and october of each year 
the notes mature on april  the notes are general unsecured obligations of our company  subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined in the notes 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit or prohibit our company or our subsidiaries from incurring additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
we have the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time on or after april   at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading  as defined in the indenture  the holders of the subordinated notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holders notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of goodsports holdings pty 
ltd  an australian based marketer of formula one related apparel and other merchandise 
the consideration paid by our company consisted of the assumption of certain liabilities and contingent payments of up to million to be paid over a four year period based upon the attainment of certain performance objectives 
we do not believe that any amounts will be paid under these contingent payment commitments 
on march   we signed a series of sublease agreements whereby a third party assumed responsibility for all long term lease obligations related to goracing 
com s infrastructure  including its physical facility and all related computer equipment 
we remain the guarantor under the terms of the original agreement 
during march  we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide web hosting environments for our company 
the agreement provides for a three year term  however  we terminated the agreement pursuant to its terms prior to december monthly fees under this agreement were  also during march  we entered into a service agreement with our web hosting provider under which we are committed to purchase million worth of normal business services over a two year period 
as of september   we had fulfilled  of our million purchase commitment 
in december  our board of directors approved a program in which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the initial term of the repurchase program will be one year  subject to extension by the board of directors depending on market conditions 
we are a defendant in various lawsuits  including a securities class action lawsuit filed in november we have not made provisions in the financial statements with respect to the securities class action lawsuit we are defending 
the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit or the imposition of any damages in that lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
from time to time  we also are subject to certain asserted and unasserted claims encountered in the normal course of business 
we believe that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that damages that result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation will not be imposed in these matters 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures in fiscal will principally relate to expenditures for tooling 
our capital expenditures are not anticipated to exceed million 
we expect to file a federal income tax return claim in january of approximately million 
the amount of the refund claim will depend on final tax calculations and may differ materially from the above amount 
we expect to receive the tax refund within days after filing as provided for in the applicable tax law 
on september   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a subsidiary of bank one  providing for borrowings of up to million  subject to the limitation of a calculated borrowing base 
the loan agreement replaced our previous credit agreement with first union national bank of north carolina 
the loan agreement consists of a million revolving line of credit  which includes up to million of stand by letters of credit 
the line of credit bears interest at a base rate plus basis points  or libor plus basis points 
a commitment fee of of the average unused line of credit and of the average unused letters of credit is payable annually on the loan 
the loan agreement matures december we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million as of september  and million as of september  the loan is secured principally by our inventory  receivables  and equipment and restricts the payment of dividends 
the agreement contains covenants that require us to meet certain financial tests principally related to tangible net worth and ebitda 
following our fourth quarter loss  we were in violation of these covenants 
we have received a waiver of these covenant violations  and an amendment that reduces the assets available to be included in the calculated borrowing base by million 
as a result of this reduction and our intention of reducing outstanding receivables  we believe that the calculated borrowing base will generally be less than million 
we believe that the revised borrowing base will be adequate to cover our letter of credit and other liquidity needs for the next months after considering anticipated cash flow from operations 
an adverse change in economic conditions could materially affect our anticipated cash flow from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
we do not currently use and we have not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
at september   we had million outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes at an interest rate of  and approximately million of debt outstanding at various rates and terms  principally under promissory notes and capital leases 
interest rates on these credit instruments are fixed and comparable to current market rates 
the functional currencies for our foreign operations are the deutschmark  australian dollar  and british pound sterling 
as such  changes in exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar could adversely affect our future earnings 
given the level of income we currently derive from our foreign operations  we consider this exposure to be minimal 
a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on our future earnings
