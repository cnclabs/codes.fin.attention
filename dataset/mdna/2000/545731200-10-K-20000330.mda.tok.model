the company derives its operating revenue from worldwide sales of digital and analog audio mixers  speakers  amplifiers and other professional audio equipment 
a significant portion of the company s total sales is to customers outside the us international sales volumes have historically been affected by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
when weaknesses of local currencies have made the company s products more expensive  sales to those countries have declined 
the company s gross margins are also affected by its international sales 
typically  gross margins from exported products by mackie are lower than from those sold in the us due to discounts offered to its international distributors 
rcf does not offer discounts to its distributors 
the discounts offered by mackie are given because the international distributor typically incurs certain expenses  including technical support  product service and in country advertising that the company normally incurs for domestic sales 
the company offered its international distributors an average discount of approximately in  in  and in the decrease in discounts in is attributable to the lack of discounts offered by rcf 
sales outside the us represented approximately   and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
the company s gross margins are also affected by the purchase of some components outside of the us and italy 
as a result of fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar and italian lira  some of the company s international component suppliers have increased prices and may further increase prices 
the company currently does not employ any formal foreign exchange hedging strategies  but may do so in the future 
the company s gross margins have fluctuated from time to time due primarily to inefficiencies related to the introduction and manufacturing of new products and inefficiencies associated with integrating new equipment into the company s manufacturing processes 
historically  fluctuations have also resulted from varying prices of components and competitive pressures 
the company plans to introduce new products and product revisions at a more rapid rate than it has in the past 
some anticipated new products will require the implementation of manufacturing practices for which the company is not familiar 
this could result in lower margins as the company becomes more familiar with new manufacturing procedures

these uses of cash were offset partially by net borrowings on long term and short term debt of approximately million during in june  the company entered into a credit agreement with a bank to provide certain credit facilities to the company  including a million loan for the acquisition of rcf of which million was outstanding at december  the loan  which is secured by all of the company s assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate  or at a specified libor rate plus a specified margin  whichever the company chooses

the agreement also provides a million credit facility for capital equipment purchases or general corporate purposes 
certain terms under this facility  such as interest rate  repayment period and collateral  will be determined at the time advances are made to the company 
at december   there were no outstanding balances on any of these credit lines 
these credit facilities excluding the acquisition loan expire april  under the terms of the credit agreement  the company must maintain certain financial ratios and tangible net worth 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the agreement also provides  among other matters  restrictions on additional financing  dividends  mergers  acquisitions  and an annual capital expenditure limit of million 
the company also has entered into agreements with several banks in italy that provide short term credit facilities totaling approximately million 
at december   there was approximately million outstanding under these facilities 
the majority of these credit facilities are secured by rcf s receivables 
interest rates on these credit facilities range from to 
approximately million of rcf s debt was repaid in february the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances and its available for sale securities together with cash generated from operations and cash available from credit facilities will be sufficient to finance the company s operations at least through inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effects of inflation  the company does not believe inflation has had or is likely to have a material effect on its results of operations or liquidity

year issue the year or yk issue referred to the potential risks associated with the fact that many existing computer programs use only the last two digits in reference to a year

the yk issue did not have any material impact on the operations of the company nor is any future impact anticipated 
euro conversion european business systems are being forced to handle currencies in a new way with the introduction of the euro 
rcf s computer system does not support the euro  and reprogramming the system is not an economically viable option 
although the date for mandatory euro compliance is january   it is believed that the existing system could only be utilized until mid after which time the effort to run a non compliant system will be prohibitively high 
the company plans to replace all computer systems with a single system worldwide 
this system will be euro compliant and is scheduled to be in place in italy prior to mid share repurchase program the company fulfilled the authorization from its board of directors to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock during the three year period ended december  these purchases were executed through open market purchases at prevailing market prices 
as of december   the company had repurchased all  shares authorized under the program at a total cost of approximately million 
no additional authorizations are currently pending 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 aaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because the company does not currently hold any derivative instruments 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
the company does not expect that its financial statements will be materially affected by sab no 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company did not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  and however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and available for sale securities as well as interest paid on debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities and bonds of million and short term borrowings of million  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would not have a material impact on the company s earnings 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities and bonds of million and short term borrowings of million  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would not have a material impact on the company s earnings 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates subsidiaries in italy  the united kingdom  germany  france  the netherlands and china 
the company s business and financial condition are  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates during the period 
the company does not employ any derivative based hedging strategies  however  it has a significant natural hedge in the form of italian based manufacturing and operating  interest and tax expenses 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
all other things being equal  an average movement in the value of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of changing net income approximately million 
the same analysis for the year ended december  would have had the effect of changing net income approximately million
