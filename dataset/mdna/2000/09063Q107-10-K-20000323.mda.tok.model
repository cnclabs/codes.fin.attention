item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial information of bionova holding and the financial statements and related notes of bionova holding included elsewhere in this form k 
overview bionova holding engages in the production  distribution  and sale of fresh produce to wholesalers and retailers primarily in mexico  the united states  and canada 
the business strategy of the company consists of i vertical integration within the produce agronomics industry  ii growth by acquisition of complementary businesses and iii access to basic technology to separate itself from others in the fresh produce business  as exemplified by the merger with dnap 
dnap  which was incorporated in delaware in  is an agribusiness biotechnology company focused on the development and application of genetic engineering and transformation technologies in plants  as well as development and marketing of premium  differentiated  fresh and processed  branded fruits and vegetables 
dnap uses advanced breeding  genetic engineering  and other biotechniques to achieve improvements in the taste  texture  product form  color  and shelf life of produce and to improve production characteristics  such as disease resistance and production or processing yields 
bionova holding expects to capitalize on the combination of production  distribution  and technology strengths by focusing its longer term business strategy on the development and commercialization of value added  proprietary differentiated products that are developed with dnap s technology 
the company classifies its business into three fundamental areas farming  which consists principally of interests in company owned fresh produce production facilities and joint ventures with other growers  distribution  consisting principally of interests in sales and distribution companies in mexico  the united states  and canada  and research and development  consisting of business units focused on the development of fruits and vegetables and intellectual properties associated with these development efforts 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated total revenues declined to million for the year ended december  from million in  consolidated gross profit sales less cost of sales decreased from million in to million in  and the company s consolidated operating loss increased from million in to million in farming segment revenues  the majority of which are eliminated in consolidation  for the year ended december  were million as compared with million during farming segment loss at the gross profit line increased to million in from a million loss in the operating loss in this segment increased from million in to million in weather related factors  including abnormally cold weather impacted first half production in culiacan and in the company s joint venture in chihuahua  and plant disease and insect infestation damaged crops in the company s santa cruz joint venture in northern baja california during the second half of the year 
product pricing during the culiacan and santa cruz growing seasons also were lower than in florida and california  two of the major tomato growing areas in the united states  which compete directly with culiacan and santa cruz during these periods  experienced one of their best growing seasons in years  which in turn caused an oversupply of product in the marketplace 
this very high level of supply led to a significant deterioration in average prices of many of the company s products  and during the last quarter of prices were almost lower than the same quarter in the decline in gross margin and the higher operating loss stemmed from i the poor production output and pricing conditions which increased average unit production costs  ii the write down of receivables associated with the termination of five of absa s joint ventures  and iii higher administrative expenses in as compared with due to higher salary and wage costs  which were consistent with the rate of inflation and the impact in dollar terms of the appreciation in the mexican peso over the past year 
corporate overhead allocated to this segment of the business declined by million in as compared with the company continues to believe it can achieve operating margins before corporate overhead allocation in its wholly owned and joint venture growing operations in baja california and culiacan in the future with a return of more normal weather conditions 
however  the company has determined that a better pricing environment and or a significant lowering of costs will be required to achieve these margins 
revenues of the distribution segment declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  distribution segment gross profit declined from million in to million in  and operating income for the segment fell from million in to a loss of million in revenues in the canadian and mexican distribution operations increased by million from to due to a higher volume of shipments 
the us distributing companies reflected a significant decrease in revenues totaling million due primarily to i the discontinuation of a freshworld farms florida grower  which generated very little income for the company and ii product prices during the second half of the year that were lower than the prior year 
the distribution segment reflected a increase in gross profit in as compared with before one time charges of million for writeoffs of growers and accounts receivables 
operating income of the distribution segment decreased by million  reflecting the impact of the gross margin decline  offset in part by a reduction in corporate overhead allocated to this segment of the business 
while the results reflected a operating margin on sales before writeoffs of grower receivables  the company believes it can achieve at least a operating margin in this segment of the business in the year by increasing volumes and thereby leveraging its existing infrastructure 
research and development revenues declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development segment gross profit declined to million in from million in  and the operating loss in this segment increased from million in to million in the decline in revenues was due to lower third party licensing and contract revenues  offset in part by additional contract revenues stemming from the long term funded research agreement with savia signed at the time of the merger in savia was obligated to fund dnap at least million over the three year period that ended on september   and savia paid an incremental million in to meet this obligation 
the segment s lower gross margin in as compared with was a direct consequence of the lower revenues 
the higher operating loss in this segment in as compared with reflects the lower gross margin and the higher research and development expenses associated with the start up of activities during in vpp corporation  bionova holding s subsidiary that is working on the development of the strawberry program following the acquisition of monsanto company s strawberry assets 
the company expects to achieve a similar level of revenues in the research and development segment of its business in as it achieved in however  gross margins are expected to be lower due to a shift in the mix of revenues from licensing to contract research 
the company also anticipates spending more on research and development in as it expands its efforts to develop new products 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in due to higher corporate overhead expenses 
this increase in expenses emanated from the legal costs incurred in connection with the company s defense against shareholder suits and other general corporate expenses 
the non cash charge for amortization of goodwill  patents and trademarks increased by million in as compared with due to the recognition of a complete year of patents and trademarks amortization related to vpp s acquisition of monsanto company s strawberry assets 
interest expense increased by million in as compared with due to the higher rates of interest that prevailed on the company s debt obligations during most of the year and an increase in the average level of debt outstanding that was required to fund working capital and fixed asset investments in interest income increased by million in as compared with due primarily to higher short term investments associated with the restricted cash related to the long term floating rate notes 
in  bionova holding experienced a net foreign exchange gain of million as compared to a loss of million in the effect of a strong mexican peso and canadian dollar in accounted for this reversal 
another factor affecting year on year comparisons of foreign exchange gains and losses is that effective january   mexico ceased to be considered a highly inflationary economy 
interfruver  whose functional currency is the peso  now accounts for foreign exchange impacts on non monetary balance sheet accounts as changes to the cumulative translation account under stockholders equity rather than as foreign exchange gains and losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
absa s functional currency has been and continues to be the us dollar  therefore  its results are not affected by this change 
income tax expense increased from million in to million in this variance was primarily attributable to higher tax expense associated with the company s mexican distribution operations 
for  the share of losses allocable to minority interests was million as compared with minority interest losses of million in these allocations of losses for the years of and  respectively  were consistent with the minority positions held across the operating subsidiaries of the company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated total revenues declined to million for the year ended december  from million in despite the decline in total revenues  which was a direct consequence of the divestiture of royal van namen rvn during the first quarter of  consolidated gross profit sales less cost of sales increased from million in to million in and the company s consolidated operating loss declined from million in to million in farming segment revenues  the majority of which are eliminated in consolidation  for the year ended december  were million as compared with million during farming segment gross profit improved by million from to and the operating loss for the segment was reduced from million in to million in despite this improvement in gross margin  the company continued to struggle to get the operating margins it has believed it should obtain in the farming segment of its business 
weather related factors impacted first half production in culiacan in  and abnormally cold weather in december damaged the last stage of the crop in the company s santa cruz joint venture in northern baja california and caused damage to crops in process in culiacan 
product pricing during the culiacan growing season also has been lower than the company expected during the past several years 
revenues of the distribution companies declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decline in revenues was due to the divestiture of rvn during the first quarter of  which contributed full year revenues of million in revenues in the us  canadian  and mexican distribution operations increased by million from to due to a higher volume of shipments and the better pricing environment that prevailed  particularly during the fourth quarter of the us and canadian distribution companies reflected an improvement of million in gross profit from to due to the higher volumes and prices  which offset entirely the loss of rvn s gross margin of million recorded in operating income of the distribution companies improved by million from a loss of million in to a profit of million in due to a reduction in selling and administrative expenses associated with the divestiture of rvn 
research and development revenues and gross margins increased from to by million due to higher licensing and contract revenues 
the higher licensing and contract revenues were due largely to the granting of a license to novartis for the company s transwitch technology in the fourth quarter of the operating loss in the research and development segment was impacted in by a charge of million for purchased research and development in connection with the acquisition of the intellectual property assets of uac 
the absence of this type of charge in along with the improvement in gross margins contributed to the million improvement in the operating loss of this segment of the company s business from to research and development expenses increased from million in to million in due to the increased level of activity at dnap 
the write off in of million of purchased research and development occurred in connection with the acquisition of the intellectual property assets of united agricorp  inc uac  which included rights to genetically engineer traits in university of california strawberry varieties and rights to genes for fruit quality and disease resistance 
dna plant technology corporation had been performing research for uac since in the area of genetic modification of strawberries to improve various traits 
the acquisition price was million  which consisted of million in cash and  stock options granted to one of the principals of uac that expired in august at the time of the acquisition a zero value was assigned on the books of uac to the various rights that were acquired 
a valuation was completed to arrive at a value for in process research and development 
this valuation employed an income approach to determine the potential income the company would generate by completing the necessary development activity to incorporate quality and disease resistance traits in strawberries and susbsequently selling the transformed plants to strawberry growers over a fifteen year time horizon  discounted at a rate of 
the value derived from this analysis was significantly greater than million 
as the technologies that were being acquired from uac were not considered to have any alternative uses other than their application in the transgenic transformation of strawberry plants and additional research and development was required to demonstrate the technological feasibility of commercializing products from the assets being acquired  the entire million purchase price for the uac assets was determined to be in process research and development 
accordingly  consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  this purchased research and development was charged off immediately to current income 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses declined from million in to million in the reduction in selling and administrative expenses associated with the divestiture of rvn was offset in part by higher corporate overhead expenses 
the higher corporate expenses in emanated from the legal costs incurred in connection with the company s defense against shareholder suits  employee termination costs  and other general corporate expenses 
the employee termination costs in of million related to an agreement reached between the company and an executive officer who was in charge of the company s fresh produce business on his departure 
the non cash charge for amortization of goodwill  patents and trademarks increased by million in as compared with due to the recognition of a complete year of goodwill amortization related to bionova holding s purchase of the minority interests in absa and iphc 
interest expense increased by million in as compared with due to the higher rates of interest that prevailed on the company s debt obligations during the second half of and an increase in the average level of debt outstanding that was required to fund working capital and fixed asset investments in interest income decreased by million in as compared with due primarily to certain reclassifications 
in  bionova holding experienced a net foreign exchange loss of million as compared to a loss of million in the very high level of volatility that affected worldwide financial and currency markets in the third and fourth quarters of impacted significantly the peso dollar exchange rate 
as a consequence  both absa and interfruver experienced large exchange losses during the fourth quarter of due to their net peso monetary positions  reversing a small gain through the first three quarters of the year 
income tax expense decreased from million in to million in this variance was primarily attributable to the elimination of bionova produce  inc s tax liability due to its consolidation for tax purposes into bionova holding beginning in the third quarter of  which followed the company s acquisition of the minority interests in iphc 
for  the share of losses allocable to minority interests was million as compared with minority interest losses of million in these allocations of losses for the years of and  respectively  were consistent with the minority positions held across the operating subsidiaries of the company 
these allocations were affected significantly by the increase in the company s interests in absa and iphc effective august   and the divestiture of its entire interest in rvn  and profit distributions made by interfruver to its owners during capital expenditures during  the company made capital investments of million in property  plant and equipment  of which million was spent in the farming segment of the company s business  million in the distribution segment  and million in research and development 
major investment projects in included i the installation of new irrigation systems on agricultural land owned absa  ii additional cooling room capacity required for product quality  and iii and the completion of the new packaging facility at absa s production site in culiacan  mexico 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company used million of cash in operating activities 
the great majority of this cash usage in operations was associated with the losses sustained by the company million  offset to some extent by non cash items million 
the negative cash flow impact of changes in accounts receivable and advances to growers was million as a million decrease in accounts receivable due to stronger collection efforts was more than offset by related party receivables due from savia and the minority owners of interfruver 
inventories increased by million reflecting the investment in the farming segment for the new harvesting season 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by million reflecting similar levels of operations at year end and in addition to the capital investments discussed above  investment requirements reflected in the cash flows included the last earn out payment to interfruver in the amount of million associated with the company s purchase of its majority interest in during  the company paid million to monsanto company for the strawberry assets that were acquired in december on march   the company completed a refinancing of its million in consolidated debt 
this refinancing culminated in a three year million credit facility enabling the company to correct the significant working capital imbalance that had persisted for several years and to relieve the risk associated with the need to continuously refinance large short term lines of credit 
the key provisions of this credit arrangement consist of i a payment of the entire principal amount on the third anniversary following closing  ii prepayments at the option of the company with no penalties  iii an interest rate of libor plus  iv up front fees of million to the lead banks which arranged the financing  and v requirements that the company must keep one year s worth of interest in an interest bearing reserve account and that all existing short term financing had to be paid off with the proceeds of this loan 
the contract also provides that the company is permitted to obtain up to million in new financing for working capital purposes 
this credit facility is fully guaranteed by savia 
in the loan agreement with respect to bionova holding there are no financial covenants 
however  bionova holding is subject to the following restrictions i bionova holding and its subsidiaries are only permitted to make new investments in assets and businesses in the field of agrobiotechnology  ii the proceeds of any new debt beyond this million credit facility and the million for working capital must be used to pay down the million credit facility and the new debt must have a final maturity date that is no earlier than march   and iii bionova holding and its subsidiaries are not permitted to merge with any other company unless bionova holding or its subsidiaries is the surviving corporate entity 
savia has similar restrictions pertaining to its three year  million floating rate notes i savia and its subsidiaries are only permitted to make investments in business arenas in which they are currently involved  ii savia will not incur additional debt exceeding million unless the proceeds of any new debt are used to pay down the floating rate notes it issued and the new debt must have a final maturity date that is no earlier than march   and iii savia and its subsidiaries are not permitted to merge with any other company unless savia or its subsidiaries is the surviving corporate entity 
savia s mexican packaging company  empaques  sa de sa  and its worldwide seed company  seminis  inc have debt to ebitda requirements they must maintain on a rolling four quarter basis  and savia s mexican insurance company  seguros comercial america  sa de cv  is required to be in compliance with minimum paid in capital and technical reserve requirements and any other financial ratios or covenants as prescribed and applicable under the ministry of finance in mexico 
if savia or bionova holding is in default on any of its obligations under the loan agreement  then the lenders have the right to declare default and accelerate all of the notes 
both bionova holding and savia are currently in compliance with these restrictions and covenants 
in achieving this longer term financing  bionova holding s interest rate increased from an average of in to between and in the company obtained million of additional working capital financing at rates between and in net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
as described above  the company used the majority of the proceeds from its issuance of the three year floating rate notes to pay down existing short term debt 
since that time the company has borrowed additional funds on a short term basis for working capital purposes 
as of year end  the company had on deposit million in a restricted cash account associated with the issuance of these three year notes 
the company incurred a net loss of million and an operating cash flow deficiency of million for the year ended december  management anticipates that it may also incur a net loss and an operating cash flow deficiency for the year ending december  the losses are a result of unfavorable results of operations  primarily in the company s farming business segment  but also are due to significant research and development expenditures and substantial financing expenses associated with the company s highly leveraged financial position 
management of the company is in the process of evaluating a variety of alternatives to help sustain the company s operations and improve operating results 
savia  the indirect parent company of bionova holding  has committed at least through december  to financially support the company and its subsidiaries so that they can continue with their business plans and the fulfillment of their financial obligations 
in addition  savia has committed to continue to guarantee the short term bank loans of the company  which in the aggregate will not exceed million 
there can be no assurance that any of the alternatives being considered by management will result in sufficient working capital to significantly improve the company s current financial position or its results of operations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
absa currently has two lawsuits pending that challenge their rights of ownership to hectares of land in mexico  which represents approximately of the land owned by absa 
absa was indemnified fully by the former owners of this land  the batiz family  when it completed the acquisition of their minority interest ownership in absa in if absa were to lose both of these lawsuits  absa expects to recover the full value of this land 
absa then could either purchase new land  rent land  or contract with other growers to replace any production lost from a transfer of these specific lands 
year yk update background the company completed its year project in december this yk project included both information technology it and non it systems and was divided into four principal sections 
these sections were hardware  software  non it systems  and third parties suppliers  customers  and other 
sections   and went through seven phases  as follows i an inventory of all items relevant to yk  ii assignment of priorities regarding each of these items for the company s activities in the yk  iii determination of the company s yk capability and compliance with regard to each of these items  iv preliminary testing of yk capability  v maintenance and or replacement of items that failed to meet yk requirements  vi validation that maintenance and replacement changes met yk requirements  and vii design of contingency plans 
to date the company and its subsidiaries have operated without any disruptions associated with the changeover to the year costs incurred by the company to date with respect to the yk activities it performed amounted to million  and the entire amount of this was expensed in new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  including without limitation statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including statements regarding our financial position  business strategy  prospects  plans and objectives of our management for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give you no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following risk factors  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause these results during  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
when we use the terms bionova  we  us  and our  these terms refer to the company and its subsidiaries 
risks relating to our financial condition we may continue to sustain losses and accumulate deficits in the future we have sustained losses in    and as of december  our accumulated deficit was million 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
the factors that caused these losses  including factors described in this section  may continue to limit our ability to make a profit in the future 
we may need additional financing to achieve our growth and technology objectives  which could hurt our financial condition we may need additional capital to meet our growth objectives  working capital requirements  and to fund the purchase and development of new technologies 
our projected cash flows from operations and existing capital resources  including our existing credit lines  may not be sufficient 
therefore  our ability to pursue these objectives may depend on our ability to obtain additional capital  which could cause us to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities 
we cannot assure you that additional capital will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all  and  as a result  we may be restricted in our pursuit of future growth and technology strategies 
our leveraged position could cause us to be unable to meet our capital needs  which could hurt our financial condition at december  we had million of indebtedness and stockholders equity of million 
this level of indebtedness may pose substantial risks to our company and to our stockholders  including the possibility that we may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay our outstanding debts 
our level of indebtedness may also adversely affect our ability to incur additional indebtedness and finance our future operations and capital needs  and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities 
risks relating to our farming and distribution business bad weather and crop disease can affect the amount of produce we can grow  which can decrease our revenues and profitability weather conditions greatly affect the amount of fresh produce we bring to market  and  accordingly  the prices we receive for our produce 
storms  frosts  droughts  and particularly floods  can destroy a crop and less severe weather conditions  such as excess precipitation  cold weather and heat  can kill or damage significant portions of a crop 
crop disease and pestilence can be unpredictable and can have a devastating effect on our crops  rendering them unsalable and resulting in the loss of all or a portion of the crop for that harvest season 
even when only a portion of our crops are damaged  the profits we could have made on the crop will be severely affected because the costs to plant and cultivate the entire crop will have been incurred although we may experience low yields or may only be able to sell a portion of our crop 
in and  absa s significant losses were in large measure due to very cold weather and diseases that severely affected outputs in its culiacan operations and in its joint venture in baja california norte 
a change in absa s relationship with its joint venture in baja california norte can affect the amount of produce we grow  which can decrease revenues and profits one grower in baja california  santa cruz empacadora  s 
de rl de rl  accounted in for approximately of our consolidated sales 
due to losses incurred during the growing season  absa recently negotiated an agreement with this grower whereby the grower has pledged certain assets as collateral to secure its outstanding receivable 
absa and the grower currently are in negotiations as to whether they will continue their association agreement in and the terms and conditions of this agreement 
if an agreement is reached to continue to grow during this next growing season  we expect we will reduce our financial commitment significantly with a corresponding reduction in the amount of hectares that will be planted and harvested as compared with in turn  a reduction in the output of santa cruz would likely result in lower overall sales of the company and lower total operating profit as compared with what previously had been projected for future years 
labor shortages and union activity can affect our ability to hire workers to harvest and distribute our crops  which can hurt our financial condition the production of fresh produce is heavily dependent upon the availability of a large labor force to harvest crops 
the turnover rate among the labor force is high due to the strenuous work  long hours  necessary relocation and relatively low pay 
if it becomes necessary to pay more to attract labor to farm work  our labor costs will increase 
the mexican farm work force retained by absa is unionized 
if the union attempts to disrupt production and is successful on a large scale  labor costs will likely increase and work stoppages may be encountered  which would be particularly damaging in our industry where harvesting crops at peak times and getting them to market on a timely basis is critical 
the majority of fresh produce is shipped by truck 
in the united states and in mexico  the trucking industry is largely unionized and therefore susceptible to labor disturbances 
as a result  delivery delays caused by labor disturbances in the trucking industry or any other reason could limit our ability to get fresh produce to market before it spoils 
absa s reliance on leases and production associations could result in increased costs  which could adversely affect our financial results absa relies on agricultural land leased from others and production associations with other growers for a large part of its supply 
the average term of these land leases is two years and we expect to renew of these land leases as they expire 
if the other parties to these leases and other arrangements were to choose not to renew their agreements with absa  absa would be required to locate alternate sources of supply and or land or  in some cases  to pay increased rents for land 
in addition to increased rental rates  increases in land costs could result from increases in water charges  property taxes and related expenses 
risks relating to our scientific research and development business government regulation can cause delays and increased costs  which decrease our revenues and profitability our subsidiaries activities in the united states are extensively regulated by the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  the environmental protection agency  and other federal and state regulatory agencies in the united states 
similarly  our subsidiaries activities in mexico are extensively regulated by the secretaria de agricultura  ganaderia y desarrollo rural  the secretaria de salud  and other federal and state regulatory agencies in mexico 
also  our products may require regulatory approval or notification in the united states or in other countries in which they are tested  used or sold 
the regulatory process may delay research  development  production  or marketing and require more costly and time consuming procedures  and there can be no assurance that requisite regulatory approvals or registration of our current or future genetically engineered products will be granted on a timely basis 
if the products we develop and market are not commercial successes  we will not recoup our development and production costs  which will hurt our financial condition we are currently in the early stages of marketing several of our new products  and there can be no assurance that any of these products will be successful or will produce significant revenues or profits 
in addition  a number of our product development projects are in the early stages  and these projects may not be successful 
the success of these and future products depends on many variables  including the ability to produce and make available to the market consistent  premium quality fruits and vegetables on a year round basis  consumers willingness to pay higher prices for premium quality fruits and vegetables  and retailers willingness to carry such fruits and vegetables 
if the public is unwilling to accept genetically engineered products  we will not recoup our development and production costs  which will hurt our financial condition our second generation products are being developed through the use of genetic engineering 
the commercial success of these products will depend in part on public acceptance of the cultivation and consumption of genetically engineered products 
we cannot assure you that these products will gain sufficient public acceptance to be profitable  even if these products obtain the required regulatory approvals 
we may not be successful in obtaining patents  protecting our trade secrets and conducting our business without infringing on the rights of others  which could adversely affect our business our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce patents  maintain trade secret protection  and conduct our business without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if others develop competing technologies and market competing products  our sales could be adversely affected 
if we are not able to maintain our trade secrets or to enforce our patents  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
in addition  we license technology from third parties 
if we cannot maintain these licenses  or if we cannot obtain licenses to other useful technology on commercially reasonable terms  our research efforts could be adversely affected 
risks relating to our international operations legal limitations could affect our ownership of rural land in mexico  which could decrease our supply of produce causing a decrease in our revenues and profitability absa owns a substantial amount of rural land in mexico  which it uses to grow fresh fruits and vegetables 
historically  the ownership of rural land in mexico has been subject to legal limitations and claims by residents of rural communities  which in some cases could lead to the owner being forced to surrender its land 
absa has been  and continues to be  involved in land dispute proceedings as part of its ordinary course of business 
if absa is required to surrender any of its land  the volume of fresh fruits and vegetables it produces would decline and adversely affect our profitability 
there are currently pending in mexico two lawsuits challenging the ownership rights of absa to rural land it owns in mexico 
if both of these lawsuits were decided against absa  absa could lose a total of of all the rural land it owns in mexico 
currency fluctuations and inflation can increase the cost of our products in the united states and abroad  which decreases our revenues and profitability the currency exchange rates in mexico have historically been volatile 
for example  in december  the mexican government announced its intention to float the mexican peso against the united states dollar and  as a result  the peso devalued over relative to the dollar during that month 
since january  the value of the peso has decreased approximately 
these exchange rate fluctuations impact our subsidiaries business 
if the value of the peso decreases relative to the value of the dollar  then imports of produce into mexico for distribution by our mexican subsidiary become more expensive in peso terms and therefore more difficult to sell in the mexican market  and inflation that generally accompanies reductions in the value of the peso reduces the purchasing power of mexican consumers  which reduces the demand for all products including produce and  in particular  imported  branded or other premium quality produce 
conversely  if the value of the peso increases relative to the value of the dollar  mexican production costs increase in dollar terms  which results in lower margins or higher prices with respect to produce grown in mexico and sold in the united states and canada 
volatile interest rates in mexico can increase our capital costs historically  interest rates in mexico have been volatile  particularly in times of economic unrest and uncertainty 
high interest rates restrict the availability and raise the cost of capital for our mexican subsidiaries and for growers and other mexican parties with whom we do business  both for borrowings denominated in pesos and for borrowings denominated in dollars 
costs of operations for our mexican subsidiaries are higher as a result 
trade disputes between the united states and mexico can result in tariffs  quotas and bans on imports  including our products  which can hurt our financial condition despite the enactment of the north american free trade agreement  mexico and the united states from time to time are involved in trade disputes 
the united states has  on occasion  imposed tariffs  quotas  and importation bans on products produced in mexico 
us tomato growers have brought dumping claims against mexican tomato growers and may do so again 
because some of our subsidiaries produce products in mexico  which we sell in the united states  such actions  if taken  could adversely affect our business 
general business risks bionova international  inc 
has substantial control over our company and can affect virtually all decisions made by our stockholders bionova international beneficially owns  shares of our common stock accounting for of all issued and outstanding shares 
as a result  bionova international has the requisite voting power to significantly affect virtually all decisions made by bionova and our stockholders  including the power to elect all of our directors and to block corporate actions such as an amendment to most provisions of our certificate of incorporation 
this ownership and management structure will inhibit the taking of any action by bionova which is not acceptable to bionova international 
we may not be able to adapt our management information systems and controls to keep pace with our future growth  which could hurt our financial condition our business has undergone rapid growth through acquisition of complementary businesses 
in  we acquired dna plant technology and its subsidiaries 
in  we created vpp corporation to acquire most of the assets of united agricorp  inc in  we acquired full ownership of absa and international produce holding company  and their subsidiaries 
as a result of these acquisitions  significant strains have been placed on the management  operations and financial resources of our subsidiaries 
the realization of our business strategy depends on  among other things  our ability to adapt management information systems and controls and to hire  train and retain qualified employees to allow these operations to be effectively managed 
the geographic separation of our subsidiaries operations exacerbates these issues
