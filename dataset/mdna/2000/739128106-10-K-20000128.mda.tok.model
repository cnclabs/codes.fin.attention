the company s ability to satisfy its cash requirements is evaluated by analyzing key measures of liquidity applicable to the company 
the following table is a summary of the liquidity measures which management believes to be significant

to 
to 
to management believes that the company continues to maintain a strong liquidity position 
the change in working capital in fiscal compared to was only  however  during there were large reductions in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  and inventories  offset particularly by a reduction in accounts payable 
these reductions resulted in a large increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in working capital at october   as compared to october  is due mainly to an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and inventories and a decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
these favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
operating cash flows were  for fiscal the increase in these funds were due to the decreases in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings  accounts receivable  and inventories which was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
operating cash flows were  in fiscal the decrease when compared to fiscal was due to payments made for the settlement of the natwest litigation and decreased levels of billings in excess of costs and earnings  partially offset by increased collections on accounts receivable

the repurchased stock will be used for general corporate purposes 
the company s fiscal year asset management program will continue to focus on the reduction of accounts receivable days outstanding and reduction in inventories 
management believes that the cash and cash equivalents of  at october   along with funds generated from operating activities and funds available through borrowings from the revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet the capital requirements and operating needs of the company for at least the next twelve months 
effects of inflation and recession during the last three years  the company has not experienced any significant effects of inflation on its operations 
management continues to evaluate the potential impact inflation could have on future growth and minimize the impact by including escalation clauses in long term contracts 
recent marketing and financial reports indicate that the current economic conditions should remain in at approximately the same level as and the company does not anticipate significant increases in inflation in the immediate future 
year readiness the year readiness issue results from the historical use in computer software programs and operating systems of a two digit number to represent the year 
concerns arose as to whether certain software and hardware would fail to properly function when confronted with dates that contain as a two digit year 
to address the potential risk for disruption of operations  each subsidiary of the company developed a compliance plan and conducted numerous tests as to the effectiveness of applied solutions 
the costs to the company to achieve year readiness were approximately  to date  the company has not experienced any material problems relating to the year readiness issue
