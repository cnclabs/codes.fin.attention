item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the innsuites hospitality trust consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the innsuites hotels  inc financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the trust is a real estate investment trust which owns the sole general partner interest in the partnership 
in order for the trust to qualify as a reit under the code  neither the trust nor the partnership can operate the hotels 
therefore  each of the hotels is leased to  and operated by  the lessee pursuant to a percentage lease 
each percentage lease obligates the lessee to pay rent equal to the greater of a minimum rent or a percentage rent based on the gross revenues of each hotel 
the lessee also holds the franchise agreement for each hotel 
the lessee is owned by innsuites innternational hotels  inc  an entity owned by james f 
wirth and his wife 
the trust s principal source of cash flows is distributions from the partnership  which are dependent upon lease payments from the lessee pursuant to the percentage leases 
the lessee s ability to make payments to the partnership pursuant to the percentage leases is dependent primarily upon the operations of the hotels 
the trust s management intends to restructure and acquire the lessee in january following the guidelines of the reit modernization act 
at january   the trust owned a interest in the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership 
this change in ownership resulted primarily from the following transactions occuring between february  and april  on march   the trust purchased million additional general partner units in the partnership for million 
this transaction was fully funded by mr 
wirth who provided an unsecured loan to the trust at interest payable annually beginning march  the unpaid principal balance and accrued interest is due on march  on april   the partnership made an unsecured loan to the trust in the amount of million 
annual interest only payments are due on march of each year and are based on a interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance is due at maturity on april  the trust used the proceeds of that loan to purchase million general partner units in the partnership 
the money lent by the partnership was generated by refinancing the northern phoenix hotel and borrowing an additional million that was secured by a mortgage on that property 
the original mortgage note was restructured to match the terms of the refinanced note  which bears interest at and matures on april  monthly principal and interest payments began on april  as of april   the trust transferred  at historical cost  its interest in the scottsdale property to the partnership approximately million in exchange for million general partner units 
as a result of the aforementioned transactions  the trust increased its ownership interest in the partnership from approximately to approximately as of april  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt and depreciation of the hotels 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
the percentage leases provide for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended january   base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million was earned by the trust 
the principal determinant of percentage rent is the lessee s room revenues at the hotels  as defined by the percentage leases 
therefore  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available known as revpar  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the percentage leases 
adr increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal due to an overall market increase in room rates 
occupancy decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal year due to increased supply exceeding demand growth 
this resulted in a decrease in revpar of to in fiscal from in fiscal adr improved in fiscal due to acquisitions in fiscal and the successful repositioning of those hotels as studio and two room suite hotels that contribute more revenue per available room 
while adr increased to in from in  occupancy increased in to from due to increased occupancy rates in our california properties complimenting slight declines in occupancy at our arizona properties 
this resulted in an increase in revpar of for the twelve months ended january  the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated 
for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions 
results of operations of the trust for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  results of operations for the trust for the fiscal year ended january  reflect a full year of operations of the hotels and the fiscal year ended january  reflects a full year of operations of the initial hotels as well as a partial year of operations for the tucson st 
mary s  buena park and san diego hotels 
for the twelve months ended january   the trust had total revenues of million compared to million for the twelve months ended january   a decrease of approximately  or due primarily to the change in rent formulas effective august  total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  increased million compared to total expenses of million for the twelve months ended january  the increase in total expenses was primarily due to charges to expense of approximately  for deferred expenses related to a withdrawn public offering and a million provision for uncollected rents receivable which was partially offset by a  loss on the termination of the advisory agreement in fiscal general and administrative expenses include overhead charges for management  accounting  shareholder and legal services for the trust 
in comparing general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended january  and  these expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to charges to expense of approximately  for deferred expenses relating to a withdrawn public offering and a million provision for uncollected rents receivable from the lessee 
these were offset by decreases primarily relating to mara fees of approximately  and the loss of approximately  for the termination of the mara agreement in fiscal year total interest expense increased by  or to million from million in comparing the twelve months ended january  and january   respectively 
interest on mortgage notes payable increased approximately  or to million from million due to increased mortgage debt related to the acquisition of the buena park and san diego properties during fiscal and net additional borrowings of approximately million during fiscal for the loan modification relating to the northern phoenix property and the refinancing of the san diego property 
interest on notes payable to banks increased by or approximately  to  from  due to a full years interest in fiscal on the million credit facility obtained in fiscal  which bears a variable interest rate 
interest on notes payable to related parties increased or approximately  to  from  due to additional loans of  net of payments from james f 
wirth  current chairman  president and chief executive officer of the trust 
real estate and personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent increased approximately  or to million from million in comparing the twelve months ended january  and  respectively 
real estate and personal property taxes and property insurance increased  primarily due to the acquisition of the buena park and san diego properties during fiscal resulting in a full year of expenses in fiscal compared to months of expense for san diego and months of expense for buena park in fiscal real estate depreciation for the twelve months ended january  compared to increased approximately  or to million from million  respectively 
of the  increase  approximately  was due to the trust s acquisitions of the buena park and san diego properties resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal year the remaining  resulted primarily from an increase in capitalized refurbishment costs in the current year 
the trust had a loss before minority interest of million for the twelve months ended january   a million increase from the loss of  in the prior year 
after deducting the loss allocated to the minority interest of million  the trust had a net loss attributable to shares of beneficial interest of approximately  this represented an increase in net loss of  attributable to shares of beneficial interest comparing the twelve months ended january  and the results for the fiscal year ended january  included the recognition of a provision for uncollectible receivables of million  and a charge of approximately  resulting from withdrawing a public offering

while the revenues of the trust increased significantly to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  the trust reported a net loss of approximately  that total net loss  however  was reduced from a net loss of approximately  in fiscal the results for the fiscal year ended january  included multiple fourth quarter charges  resulting from the recognition of a provision for uncollectible receivables  a net charge recognized upon the termination of the advisory agreement between the partnership and mara  and the recognition of expenses relating to stock options 
in addition  unusual legal and professional fees are included in fiscal expenses 
without the aforementioned fourth quarter charges  the trust s earnings per share for the fiscal year ended january  would have improved by per share to a net income of per share basic for the year 
results of operations of the lessee comparison of actual results for the year ended january  compared to results of operations for the lessee for the fiscal year ended january  reflect a full year of operations of the hotels and the fiscal year ended january  reflects a full year of operations of the initial hotels as well as a partial year of operations for the tucson st 
mary s  buena park and san diego hotels 
total revenues for the lessee increased or approximately  to million from million for the twelve months ended january  and  respectively 
room revenues increased or approximately  to million from million due to the addition of the california properties and from sharp increases in room revenues at the tucson st mary s arizona property due to increased occupancy and adr for the year ended january   which was partially offset by the other six arizona properties room revenues slightly declining due to decreased occupancy rates

mary s arizona properties  which feature full service restaurants 
telecommunications revenue declined or approximately  to  from  for the twelve months ended january  and  respectively  primarily due to decreased long distance rates charged by the various long distance carriers

they decreased by or approximately  for the twelve months ended january  compared to the twelve months ended january   respectively

general and administrative expense decreased by or approximately million to million from million for the twelve months ended january  compared to the twelve months ended january   respectively 
the decrease is primarily attributable to large accounting and legal expenses incurred in fiscal related to the formation of the lessee in conjunction with the formation of the trust

liquidity and capital resources the trust  through its ownership interest in the partnership  will have its proportionate share of the benefits and obligations of the partnership s ownership interests in the hotels 
the trust s principal sources of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to its shareholders  is its share of the partnership s cash flow 
the partnership s principal source of revenue is rent payments under the percentage leases 
the lessee s obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured and its ability to make rent payments to the partnership under the percentage leases  and the trust s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to its shareholders  will depend upon the ability of the lessee to generate sufficient cash flow from hotel operations 
during fiscal and  the trust recorded million and  respectively  as provisions for uncollectible receivables 
these charges reflect the trust s assessment of the collectability of its receivables which primarily consists of rent receivable from the lessee  based on an evaluation of the lessee s future cash flows 
the trust s management may restructure and acquire the lessee in january following the guidelines of the reit modernization act 
as of january   the trust has no commitments for capital expenditures beyond a reserve for refurbishment and replacements set aside annually  described below 
the trust intends to acquire and develop additional hotels and expects to incur indebtedness to fund those acquisitions and developments 
the trust may also incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the trust s investments are insufficient to make the required distributions 
the terms of the line of credit discussed below permit borrowings for that purpose  but impose certain limitations on the trust s ability to engage in other borrowings 
on april   the trust obtained a million credit facility the credit facility from pacific century bank to assist it in its funding of the acquisition and development of additional hotels and for certain other business purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by first mortgages on three of the hotels 
the trust has drawn million from its line of credit  which charges interest at a variable interest rate 
by its terms  the credit facility will expire in approximately one year on april   subject to renewal 
the terms of the credit facility require the trust to maintain a net worth combined with minority interest of not less than million and  as of the end of each fiscal quarter  maintain a debt to net worth ratio of not greater than to  a net operating income to debt service relating to encumbered properties ratio of not less than to  and a net operating income to debt service ratio of not less than to the trust may prepay the credit facility  subject to a prepayment penalty of plus a yield maintenance penalty 
during the term of the credit facility the trust may not further encumber its collateral  sell its collateral  change the nature of its business  or unreasonably suspend its business 
at january   the trust was not in compliance with certain covenant requirements associated with the credit facility  however  the trust obtained a waiver from the lender indicating that the debt would not be called as a result of defaults occurring through january  subsequent to january   the trust negotiated a change in the covenant covering debt to tangible net worth from to 
as a result  the trust is in compliance with all covenants subsequent to january  the trust may seek to increase the amount of its credit facility  negotiate additional credit facilities  or issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by the trust may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate and be subject to such other terms as the trust considers prudent 
the trust will acquire or develop additional hotels only as suitable opportunities arise  and the trust will not undertake acquisition or redevelopment of properties unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from borrowings under the credit facility or other borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of shares of beneficial interest or other securities 
there is no agreement or understanding to invest in any other properties  and there can be no assurance that the trust will successfully acquire or develop additional hotels 
the partnership will contribute to a capital expenditures fund the fund on a continuing basis  from the rent paid under the percentage leases  an amount equal to of the lessee s revenues from operation of the hotels 
the fund is intended to be used for capital improvements to the hotels and refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  in addition to other uses of amounts in the fund considered appropriate from time to time 
the partnership anticipates making similar arrangements with respect to future hotels that it may acquire or develop 
during fiscal years ended january  and  the hotels spent approximately million and million  respectively  for capital expenditures  excluding hotel acquisitions 
the trust considers the majority of these improvements to be revenue producing 
therefore  these amounts have been capitalized and are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the hotels also spent million and million  respectively  during fiscal years and on repairs and maintenance and these amounts have been charged to expense as incurred 
inflation the trust s revenues are based on the percentage leases  which will result in changes in the trust s revenues based on changes in the underlying hotel revenues 
therefore  the trust will be relying entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessee s ability to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and the lessee in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessee s ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
the trust s largest fixed expense is the depreciation of the investment in hotel properties 
the trust s variable expenses  which are subject to inflation  represented approximately of total revenues in fiscal these variable expenses general and administrative costs  as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the six southern arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and  to a lesser extent  the fourth fiscal quarter 
the second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at those six southern arizona hotels 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the trust s quarterly lease revenue under the percentage leases 
the hotels located in northern arizona and california historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters the summer season  providing some balance to the general seasonality of the hotel business 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  because of temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  the trust may utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to make distributions to its shareholders 
no assurance can be given that the trust will make distributions in the future 
year compliance the trust and the lessee have upgraded their computer accounting programs and the lessee upgraded its computerized property management system along with necessary hardware 
the new systems have been warranted to be year compliant 
the trust incurred total costs to date of approximately  to upgrade these systems 
while these new systems represent virtually all of the trust s computer systems  the trust and the lessee cannot predict the effect of the year problem on vendors  customers and other entities with which the trust and the lessee transact business  and there can be no assurance that the effect of the year problem on such entities will not adversely affect the trust s or the lessee s operations 
although the trust is not aware of any threatened claims related to the year  the trust may become subject to litigation arising from such claims  and depending on the outcome  such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the trust 
it is not clear whether the trust s insurance coverage would be adequate to offset these and other business risks related to the year in the event of any failure of any of the computer systems  the trust and the lessee intend to perform necessary functions without the aid of the affected computer systems until any year problems are resolved 
as of may   no computer or software problems relating to the year have been discovered 
however  problems relating to the year could still arise

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks and other notes payable 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fiscal debt type thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt         average interest rate variable rate debt        interest rate available on january  approximately  of debt was repaid by february  and is not included in the aforementioned summary 
the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and future interest rates
