item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction priority healthcare corporation was formed in june to succeed to the business operations of companies previously acquired by bwi  as described below 
from our formation through our initial public offering ipo on october   we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi  and procured a number of services from  and engaged in a number of financial and other transactions with  bwi 
after the ipo  we continued to be controlled by bwi  but operated on a stand alone basis 
on december   bwi distributed to the holders of bwi common stock on december  all of the shares of our class a common stock owned by bwi  making priority healthcare corporation a stand alone public company 
accordingly  since the ipo we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental recurring legal  audit  risk management and administrative costs related to operating as a stand alone entity that we did not experience as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi 
the financial information included in this annual report on form k prior to is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows as a stand alone public company 
priority healthcare corporation provides specialty pharmaceuticals and related medical supplies as well as disease treatment services to the office based physician  outpatient renal dialysis and homecare markets 
our operations are derived from the acquisition by bwi of substantially all of the assets of charise charles  a specialty wholesale distributor of oncology and renal care biopharmaceuticals  in february and of prn  a specialty wholesale distributor of renal care supplies and dialysis equipment  in october we subsequently acquired c  a specialty distributor of acute dialysis products  in october  iv  inc  iv one services  inc 
and national pharmacy providers  inc  three related companies that provided specialty pharmacy and related healthcare services  in january  grove way pharmacy  a vaccine and injectable drug distributor  in august  pharmacy plus  ltd  a specialty pharmacy  in april  and monitors unlimited  inc  a distributor in the oral surgery market  in september these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
as a result  period to period comparisons of financial position and results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
the operations of charise charles  prn  c  grove way pharmacy and monitors unlimited are now included in our priority healthcare distribution division  and iv  inc which now is named priority healthcare pharmacy  inc 
and includes the operations of iv one services  inc and national pharmacy providers  inc  which merged into iv  inc

historically  priority healthcare pharmacy has generated substantially higher margins than priority healthcare distribution and has contributed a significant portion of our earnings 
results of operations compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the growth reflected primarily the addition of new customers  new product introductions  additional sales to existing customers  the acquisitions of pharmacy plus  ltd 
and monitors unlimited  inc and inflationary price increases

gross profit increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in gross profit reflected increased sales by both priority healthcare distribution and priority healthcare pharmacy and the acquisitions of pharmacy plus and monitors unlimited

competition continues to exert pressure on margins 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative sga expense increased to million in from million in  an increase of

the increase in sga expense reflected the growth in our business and the acquisitions of pharmacy plus and monitors unlimited 
the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales resulted from the spreading of fixed costs over a larger sales base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization d a increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in d a was primarily the result of depreciation of new equipment  particularly management information systems  offset  in part  by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets that became fully amortized 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  increased to million in from  in  an increase of 
in  interest income of million was primarily related to amounts earned by investing cash and funds received from the june and july secondary public offering of our class b common stock the secondary offering in overnight repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and in marketable securities  and interest income of  was related to loaning funds to bwi 
in  interest income of  and million was primarily related to amounts earned by investing funds received from the ipo in overnight repurchase agreements with a major financial institution and loaning funds to bwi  respectively 
this interest income was partially offset by interest expense of  on the subordinated note issued to bwi on march  which was paid september  and interest expense of  on the deferred compensation of one of our executives 
the interest income or expense on the loans to or borrowings from bwi is calculated by applying bwi s average incremental borrowing rate  which was and for and  respectively  to the average outstanding balances

the increase in sga expense reflected the growth in our business 
the increase in sga expense as a percentage of net sales resulted from incurring expenses associated with our grove city  ohio facility  which opened in november  training and payroll costs from hiring additional sales personnel at priority healthcare pharmacy  and increased overall costs of being a publicly traded company

liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund working capital needs to support internal growth  for acquisitions and for capital expenditures 
our principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
management controls inventory levels in order to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities 
we sell inventory to our customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of our major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although we monitor closely the creditworthiness of our major customers  there can be no assurance that we will not incur some collection loss on major customer accounts receivable in the future 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million at december  in addition  we have a million unsecured line of credit which has not been used during the two years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities 
our operations generated million in cash during accounts receivable  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily to support the increase in sales and the extension of credit terms to meet competitive conditions 
inventory  net of acquisitions  increased million in primarily to support the increase in sales 
the million increase in accounts payable partially reduced the cash requirements for accounts receivable  this increase was attributable to the increase in inventory  the timing of payments and the credit terms negotiated with vendors 
we anticipate that our operations may require cash to fund our growth 
d a totaled million in net cash used by investing activities 
in we purchased million of marketable securities with a portion of the funds received from the secondary offering 
effective april   we acquired the majority of the operating assets of pharmacy plus  ltd  a specialty pharmacy in philadelphia  pennsylvania  for million and effective september   we acquired the majority of the operating assets of monitors unlimited  inc  a distributor in the oral surgery market  for million 
in we purchased million in fixed assets  primarily computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment for the new corporate facility and transportation equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures during will be approximately million 
we anticipate that these expenditures will relate primarily to the purchase of computer hardware and software and telecommunications equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities 
in june and july we received million from our secondary offering 
we also had advanced excess cash to bwi on an interest bearing basis under the terms of a million revolving credit promissory note which was effective through december  on december  all outstanding amounts were paid in full on such note 
during our receivable from bwi decreased by million 
also during we received proceeds of million  including the income tax benefit  from stock option exercises 
from august to december  we purchased treasury stock for million because our management team felt the market undervalued our stock 
we believe that the net proceeds from the secondary offering  cash from operations and availability under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least two years 
inflation our financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of our ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  we believe that our gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products we distribute 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as we receive them and therefore they reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
year issues during the past three years  we replaced our hardware and software systems for reasons other than year compliance 
one software package was upgraded during to be year compliant 
the total cumulative costs relating to the upgrade of our software programs was approximately  year issues have not had a material adverse effect on our operations and we believe that we successfully avoided any significant disruption from the year issue

for this purpose  any statement contained in this report that is not a statement of historical fact may be deemed to be a forward looking statement 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  certain of which are beyond our control  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of important factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of a decline in the market value of our investments in marketable debt securities as a result of potential changes in interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates on securities included in our portfolio  and given the short term maturities of all of our investments in interest sensitive securities  this hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the period end carrying value
