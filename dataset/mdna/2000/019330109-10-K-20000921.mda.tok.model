operating results fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company recorded net income of  in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenues was due to a increase in revenues from the company s motion control products  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the company s power and process systems and instrumentation products 
the increase in motion control revenues was primarily due to expansion into new high growth applications such as test instrumentation for the fiberoptic telecommunications industry as well as the expansion of existing applications 
at june  backlog for motion control orders was in excess of million  higher than at june  this is a reflection of motion control s continued expansion into new markets and broader segments of its existing markets 
the increased order rate and backlog indicate that the segment should continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability in fiscal year the decrease in power and process revenues was due to a decline in orders and sales from the process instrumentation business partially as a result of the company s delay in releasing a new calibration product line which has now been completed and shipments started in may in addition  the decline was partially due to higher sales being achieved in fiscal year from customers purchasing upgrade products to comply with year requirements which reduced their funds available for projects in our fiscal year at june  backlog for power and process orders was  which was higher than at the end of the previous year 
this reflects higher backlog for power instrumentation and systems automation products partially offset by a decreased backlog for process instrumentation products 
sales to international customers decreased from  or of sales  in fiscal  to  or of sales  in fiscal due to a decrease in sales of fault recording and maintenance products in foreign markets 
sales order backlog increased from  at june  to  at june  cost of products sold decreased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal due to increased sales volume and changes in the mix of products sold 
selling expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal resulting from savings due to the continued overall cost reduction efforts of the company 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to bonuses paid to the management of profitable operations 
engineering and development expenses decreased from  in to  in amortization of intangibles and other assets decreased from  in to  in the decrease was primarily due to the  of amortization and  write off in fiscal of the goodwill from the acquisition of hathaway systems limited hsl

kehui and hathaway power monitoring systems company  ltd 
hpms 
the company holds a interest in si fang  a interest in kehui and a interest in hpms

the company may sell these products outside of china 
kehui designs  manufactures and sells cable and overhead fault location products  scada systems and other test instruments within the china market and the company may sell these products outside of china 
hpms manufactures and sells  under a license from the company  instrumentation products designed by the company to electric power companies in china 
during fiscal the company sold a portion of its investment in its si fang joint venture to another partner  reducing its ownership from to 
the company received  and recognized a  gain on the sale 
the gain is included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company reinvested the proceeds from the sale plus an additional  in cash to maintain this ownership interest 
during fiscal  the company received  in cash dividends from this joint venture 
the company has no future commitments relating to its chinese investments 
the company accounts for the chinese joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
at the time of the original investments in the chinese joint ventures and until the beginning of fiscal  the company determined that due to the start up nature of the entities  their untested products and political uncertainty in china  the realization of the initial investments and subsequent earnings which were not significant was uncertain  and  therefore  the company fully reserved against the original investments and its share of any equity in income 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing during fiscal years and  si fang and kehui s operations matured  their products have gained significant acceptance and both companies have achieved sustained profitability 
because of the sustained positive operating results  offset by a certain amount of political and business uncertainty in china  the company recognized a portion of its share of equity income from these two joint ventures  totaling  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
these amounts are included in equity income from investments in joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations

the company acquired tate integrated systems tis effective september  tis has operated under the ownership of hathaway industrial automation hia  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  since october  hia is a full service supplier of process automation systems for industrial applications 
hia has developed a state of the art software system for supervisory control and data acquisition scada and distributed control systems dcs 
the hia system has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and wastewater treatment plants  glass manufacturing plants  oil and gas terminals and tank farm facilities 
in addition to expanding into its traditional process markets  hia s system is being marketed to the deregulated power utility industry 
the company has been successful at integrating the hia system with certain other hathaway products and targeting the integrated product at substation automation and integration applications used in the generation  transmission and distribution of power 
the automation system allows for the measurement  control and communication of information including data for the metering of electricity to ensure the reliable delivery of power  provide data privacy and to control security 
for the years ended june   and  hia had losses before income taxes of approximately  million and million  respectively 
hia s traditional business is highly dependent on sales to the industrial market which typically encompasses a long sales cycle  significant customization to specific customer requirements  long performance periods and large contract values which are subject to a high degree of scrutiny and negotiation with customers 
consistent with the company s strategy to develop applications for the hia software for the deregulated power industry  the company has continued to invest substantial resources in hia 
hia s system is now successfully installed at generator sites in california and as part of pilot projects for several power companies where the system has been installed for evaluation in both transmission substations and generating plants 
the company also has a contract to install the technology at over eighty generating plants that supply electric power to the new england area 
the systems are designed to adapt to the power industry s future needs by allowing for the addition of future enhancements and systems capabilities 
management believes that the software products developed by hia  as modified for the power industry and combined with other company products  will provide power companies with automated and integrated systems solutions that will both reduce their operating costs and improve the reliability of their power supply 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications will be successful and or economically viable 
management believes that there is significant demand in the power industry for such solutions as a result of the business environment created by the recent industry deregulation 
the successful implementation of the company s current business plan continues to be partially dependent on the company s ability to successfully market hia s products to the deregulated power industry 
the factors that will affect the success of implementing this business plan include  but are not limited to  the ability to win sufficient amount of project work on favorable terms to the company  the ability to complete projects in a timely and cost effective manner  and the existence of sufficient demand for the hia products 
an inability to achieve this plan in the planned timeframe may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
in fiscal year the company recognized a provision for income taxes of  compared to  in fiscal year the effective tax rate as a percentage of the income or loss before income taxes was a provision of in fiscal and in fiscal the difference is primarily due to the change in the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset 
in year fiscal  the valuation allowance was decreased due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  whereas in fiscal year  the valuation allowance was increased due to the increase in net operating losses being carried forward 
the difference is also due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses and goodwill amortization 
realization of the company s remaining net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and the remaining net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s management believes that  on a more likely than not basis  the recorded net deferred tax asset is realizable 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenues was due to a increase in revenues from the company s power and process instrumentation products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the company s motion control products 
the decrease in motion control revenues was primarily due to decreased orders as a result of the asian economic crises and the slowdown in the semi conductor industry partially offset by the addition of revenues from emoteq uk 
motion control orders  however  increased over the prior year  with the order rate progressively increasing over the last three quarters of fiscal at june  backlog for motion control orders was higher than at june  this is a reflection of motion control s expansion into new markets and broader segments of its existing markets 
sales to international customers decreased from  or of sales  in fiscal  to  or of sales  in fiscal sales order backlog increased from  at june  to  at june  cost of products sold remained at of revenues in fiscal and selling expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal resulting from savings due to the overall cost reduction efforts of the company as well as from hia s change in its primary focus to the deregulated power industry in from industrial markets in previous periods 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to bonuses paid to the management of profitable operations and the addition of emoteq uk 
engineering and development expenses increased from  in to  in amortization of intangibles and other assets decreased from  in to  in the decrease was primarily due to the  impairment write off in fiscal of the unamortized portion of goodwill which resulted from the hia acquisition  partially offset by the  impairment write off in fiscal of the unamortized portion of goodwill from the acquisition of hathaway systems limited hsl  and fiscal amortization expense related to the ashurst acquisition 
see further discussion under business acquisition below 
as a result of its acquisition of hsl  the company had previously recorded goodwill of  at june  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 the company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired from its acquisition of hsl was impaired  and  therefore  wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  the company s determination was based on projections of undiscounted cash flows of hsl  which were based on current marketplace conditions  low orders and continuing losses 
such undiscounted cash flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired 
utilizing such projections and discounting the estimated cash flows  the company determined that the entire unamortized amount was impaired 
the current year amortization of  and impairment write off of  totaling  is included in amortization of intangibles and other in the fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognized a portion of its share of equity income from kehui and si fang  two of its joint venture investments in china  totaling  and  in fiscal years and  respectively

as of june   the jv had ceased all operations due to unprofitability and the asian economic downturn 
during fiscal year  the jv was dissolved and settled its existing obligations from its existing assets 
the license to manufacture  market and sell the tis system reverted back to the company and the company has no further obligations related to this jv 
in fiscal year the company recognized a provision for income taxes of  compared to a benefit of  in fiscal year the effective tax rate was a provision of in fiscal and a benefit of in fiscal the difference is primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses and goodwill amortization plus an increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the increase is also due to income taxes payable in local tax jurisdictions where the company has no net operating losses 
the valuation allowance was increased primarily due to the increased level of net operating losses being carried forward and the company s continued operating losses 
realization of the company s net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company generating sufficient united states federal taxable income approximately  in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s management believes that  on a more likely than not basis  the recorded net deferred tax asset is realizable 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future united states federal taxable income are changed

financing activities generated  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  and used  in fiscal year the increase in cash generated from financing activities in was due to proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  as well as increased net borrowings on the line of credit 
the increased cash used in financing activities in was due to repayments  net of borrowings  on the line of credit of  at june   the company had  of bank debt  compared with  at june   an increase of  the debt at june  represents borrowings on the company s current long term financing agreement agreement with silicon valley bank silicon 
the agreement matures on may  and  accordingly  the  balance has been classified as a current liability as of june  the agreement is subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for successive additional terms of one year each unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date 
borrowings on the loan are restricted to the lesser of  or of the company s eligible receivables maximum credit limit 
as of june   of the company s eligible receivables exceeded the maximum loan amount  therefore  the company could borrow an additional  up to the maximum credit limit of the loan bears interest at silicon s prime borrowing rate prime rate  at june  plus 
the interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly basis to prime rate plus if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period

the unused line fee is also adjustable on a quarterly basis  if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period  the monthly unused line fee will be adjusted to 
the company must continue to meet this quarterly financial goal  or the rate will be re adjusted to 
the company qualified for the lower interest rate and unused line fee beginning january  the debt is secured by all assets of the company 
the agreement requires that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth 
at june   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
as in the three year period ended june   the company s fiscal working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from cash provided by operations  the existing cash balance of  and the  available under the long term financing agreement at june  the company believes that such amounts are sufficient to fund operations and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
as explained above  the company s agreement with silicon matures on may  but will continue for successive additional terms of one each year unless either party gives notice of termination at least sixty days before the maturity date 
the company has not received notice of termination and does not anticipate receiving or giving such notice 
in june  the company filed a request for an income tax ruling by the internal revenue service irs with respect to the tax free treatment of the possible spin off of its power and process business from its motion control business 
in december  the irs issued a favorable ruling on the proposed transaction  however  because of the downturn in results of the motion control business in fiscal and losses being incurred by the power and process business  the company did not believe it was prudent to proceed with the spin off 
the company will continue to explore opportunities for increasing shareholder value that could include consideration of a spin off of the power and process business as well as other alternatives 
year compliance in fiscal  the company adopted a yk readiness program and prepared for year effects on the proper functioning of computer systems included in its products  software systems used in its business and items purchased from its suppliers 
the company has not experienced  and does not anticipate experiencing in the future any year related failures in its products 
in addition there was no interruption in or failure of normal business activities or operations due to year failures experienced in its internal systems  processes and facilities or from its key vendors  suppliers or subcontractors nor are any anticipated in the future 
the company s activities related to year compliance were performed with internal resources 
all payroll and associated costs related to the year issue were expensed as incurred 
year activities did not delay other projects or materially impact the company s business however  certain customers may have deferred purchases of certain power products due to their own year concerns 
with the year rollover completed  the company believes it obtained any such deferred sales during fiscal the company will continue to monitor whether it needs to further address any anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year consequences 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of june   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at june   approximately million was outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
the line of credit matures in may and is subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for successive annual terms of one year each unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates that are tied to various market indices 
additionally  the company monitors interest rates frequently and has sufficient cash balances to pay off the line of credit should interest rates increase significantly 
as a result  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in northern ireland and england 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the british us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins  net income and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the british pound 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
it also specifies the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depending on the intended use of the instrument and whether and how it is designated as a hedge 
sfas was effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  during  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas  sfas which delayed the effective date of sfas until all fiscal years beginning after june  through june   the company had not entered into any transactions involving derivative financial instruments and  therefore  cannot predict the financial statement impact of adopting sfas with respect to transactions that have not yet been entered into 
in december  the sec staff released sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
in order to recognize revenue  there must be persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must have occurred or services must have been rendered  the selling price must be fixed or determinable  and collectibility must be reasonably assured 
the accounting and disclosures described in sab must be applied no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of the company s fiscal year beginning after december  fiscal 
the company believes that adoption of sab no 
will not materially impact its financial statements 
however  implementation guidelines for this bulletin  as well as potential new bulletins  could result in unanticipated changes to the company s current revenue recognition policies 
these changes could affect the timing of the company s future revenue recognition and results of operations
