item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s utility operations are subject to regulation by the psc  which plays a significant role in determining the company s return on equity 
the psc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment 
the company s rate tariffs allow the cost of gas to be passed through to customers see business regulatory matters 
the company s business is temperature sensitive 
accordingly  the company s sales volumes in any given period reflect  in addition to other factors  the impact of weather  with colder temperatures generally resulting in increased sales volumes by the company 
the company anticipates that this sensitivity to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to be reflected in the company s sales volumes in future periods 
however  delta s current tariffs  approved by the psc effective january   provide for some adjustment of gas rates through a weather normalization tariff 
under the weather normalization tariff  delta s rates for residential and small non residential customers are generally increased when winter weather is warmer than normal and decreased when winter weather is colder than normal 
delta is permitted to adjust rates for these classes of customers for the billing months of december through april under this tariff 
liquidity and capital resources because of the seasonal nature of delta s sales  the smallest proportion of cash generated from operations is received during the warmer months when sales volumes decrease considerably 
additionally  most construction activity takes place during the non heating season because of more favorable weather conditions 
during the warmer  non heating months  therefore  cash needs for operations and construction are partially met through short term borrowings 
capital expenditures for delta for fiscal are expected to be million 
delta has been generating internally only a portion of the cash necessary for its capital expenditure requirements and thus finances the balance of its capital expenditures on an interim basis through the use of its borrowing capability under its short term line of credit 
the current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june  the line of credit  which is with bank one  kentucky  na  requires renewal during november  these short term borrowings are periodically repaid with the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities  as was done in march   when the net proceeds of  from the sale of  of debentures were used to repay short term debt and to redeem the company s debentures  that would have matured in  in the amount of  the primary cash flows during the last three years are summarized below provided by operating activities    used in investing activities    provided by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash provided by operating activities consists of net income and noncash items including depreciation  depletion  amortization and deferred income taxes 
additionally  changes in working capital are also included in cash provided by operating activities 
the company expects that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating  normal capital expenditure and dividend requirements 
results of operations operating revenues the increase in operating revenues for of  was primarily attributable to increased gas rates and increased non regulated sales volumes 
gas rates increased due to higher gas prices coupled with increases from the impact of the weather normalization tariff 
non regulated revenues increased due to the  mcf  or  increase in non regulated sales volumes 
the decrease in operating revenues for of  was primarily attributable to lower gas rates and lower sales volumes 
gas rates decreased due to lower gas prices 
sales volumes declined primarily due to milder winter weather 
heating degree days billed for were of normal as compared with of normal for and of normal for the following table sets forth certain comparisons for variations in revenues for the last two fiscal years increase decrease compared to compared to variations in regulated revenues gas rates   weather normalization adjustment  sales volumes   transportation   other   total   variations in non regulated revenues gas rates   sales volumes   total   total variations in revenues   variations in regulated volumes gas sales transportation variations in non regulated volumes gas sales operating expenses the increase in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to increased gas purchases for non regulated sales and from increases in the cost of gas purchased for retail sales 
the decrease in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to the decreases in the cost of gas purchased for retail sales and from decreased gas purchases for retail sales resulting from the warmer winter weather in the increases in depreciation expense during and of  and  respectively  were due primarily to additional depreciable plant 
changes in income taxes during and of  and  respectively  were primarily due to changes in net income 
interest charges the increase in other interest charges during was due primarily to increased average short term borrowings 
the increase in interest on long term debt during was due primarily to the issuance of million of debentures in march  the decrease in other interest during was due primarily to decreased average short term borrowings 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended june   and  basic earnings per common share changed as a result of changes in net income and the increased average common shares outstanding that resulted from the common shares issued under delta s dividend reinvestment plan and shares issued to employees during the periods 
there are no potentially dilutive securities  therefore basic and diluted earnings per common share are the same

these forward looking statements are identified by their language  which may in some cases include words such as estimates  expects  plans  anticipates  intends  will continue  believes  and similar expressions 
such forward looking statements may concern future matters among other matters such as delta s cost and the availability of natural gas supplies  delta s capital expenditures  its sources and availability of funding for operation and expansion  delta s anticipated growth and growth opportunities through system expansion and acquisition  competitive conditions  delta s productive and transportation activities  regulatory and legislative matters  dividends  and external and internal funding sources 
such forward looking statements are accordingly subject to important risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward looking statements or historical results include the impact or outcome of the ongoing restructuring of the gas industry and the outcome of the regulatory proceedings related to that restructuring 
the changing regulatory environment generally 
a change in the right under present regulatory rules to recover through rates changes in costs of gas supply 
uncertainty as to regulatory approval for full recovery of delta s costs and for its expenditures for regulatory assets 
uncertainty in delta s capital expenditure requirements 
changes in economic conditions  demographic patterns and weather conditions in delta s retail service areas 
changes affecting delta s cost of providing gas service  including changes in interest rates  changes in the availability of external sources of financing for delta s operations  tax laws  environmental laws  and the general rate of inflation 
changes affecting the cost of competing energy alternatives and competing gas distributors 
changes in accounting principles or the application of such principles to delta 
new accounting pronouncements delta adopted sfas no 
 earnings per share  during fiscal the adoption of this standard had no effect upon current or prior period earnings per common share 
delta adopted sfas no 
 comprehensive income  during fiscal sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
the adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial statements of the company 
delta adopted sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  and sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  during fiscal these statements do not affect the accounting recognition or measurements of transactions  but rather require expanded disclosures regarding financial results 
in june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
the statement has subsequently been amended by sfas no 
issued june  and sfas no 
issued june  this statement  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and thus for the company s fiscal year delta is currently not a party to any derivatives for hedging or other purposes 
delta has concluded that its contracts for the purchase  sale  transportation and storage of natural gas constitute normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
and  as such  are not subject to the accounting requirements of the new standard 
therefore  the company believes that adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in gas operations and supply under item  the company is a party to long term fixed price gas purchase and transportation contracts 
therefore  the prices the company pays under these contracts may differ from the current market prices 
however  the company has minimal price risk resulting from these contracts as these costs are passed through to customers either through delta s gas cost recovery mechanism or specific contracts with customers 
the company currently is not a party to hedge instruments or other agreements that represent derivatives
