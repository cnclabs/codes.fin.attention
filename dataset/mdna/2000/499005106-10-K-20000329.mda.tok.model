item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading market maker in nasdaq securities  other otc equity securities  and nyse and amex listed equity securities in the third market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  knight  we make markets in approximately  equity securities in nasdaq and on the nasd s otc bulletin board 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  trimark  we make markets in all nyse and amex listed equity securities in the third market 
knight commenced nasdaq and otc securities market making operations on july  based on rankings published by the autex group  knight was ranked first in autex s nasdaq otc securities rankings  with a market share during december knight s share volume totaled billion  billion  billion and billion  or   and of our total share volume  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
since commencing operations in  knight s business has grown rapidly and accounted for   and of our total share volume growth during the years ended december    and  respectively 
since our acquisition of trimark in march  trimark has also experienced significant increases in share volume 
in addition  trimark has held the market share ranking in trading of nyse and amex listed securities in the third market for over two years 
trimark s share volume totaled billion  billion  billion and billion  or   and of our total share volume for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors  including the value of our securities positions and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our market making activities  volatility in the securities markets  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and expenses  the amount of revenue derived from limit orders as a percentage of net trading revenues  changes in payments for order flow or clearing costs  the addition or loss of sales and trading professionals  regulatory changes  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and general conditions 
if demand for our market making services declines and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  significant seasonality in our business 
due to all of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past  that we will be able to improve our operating results or that we will be able to sustain our profitability on an annual and or quarterly basis 
revenues our revenues consist principally of net trading revenue from market making activities 
net trading revenue  which represents trading gains net of trading losses  is primarily affected by changes in trade and share volumes from customers  our ability to derive trading gains by taking proprietary positions  primarily to facilitate customer transactions  and  most recently  by regulatory changes and evolving industry customs and practices 
our net trading revenue per trade for otc securities has historically exceeded the net trading revenue per trade for listed securities 
we continue to focus on increasing our sales to institutional customers 
otc securities transactions with institutional customers are executed as principal  and all related profits and losses are included within net trading revenue 
listed securities transactions with institutional customers are executed on an agency basis  for which we earn commissions on a per share basis 
we also receive fees for providing certain information to market data providers 
commissions and fees are primarily affected by changes in our trade and share volumes in listed securities 
we also earn interest income from our cash held at banks and cash held in trading accounts at clearing brokers  net of transaction related interest charged by clearing brokers for facilitating the settlement and financing of securities sold  not yet purchased  and interest on subordinated notes and short term debt 
interest  net is primarily affected by the changes in cash balances held at banks and clearing brokers  and the level of securities sold  not yet purchased  and the principal amount outstanding under subordinated notes and short term debt 
expenses our operating expenses largely consist of employee compensation and benefits  payments for order flow and execution and clearance fees 
a substantial portion of these expenses is variable in nature 
employee compensation and benefits expense  which is largely profitability based  fluctuates  for the most part  based on changes in net trading revenue and our profitability 
payments for order flow fluctuate based on share volume  the mix of market orders and limit orders and the mix of orders received from broker dealers who accept payments for order flow 
execution and clearance fees fluctuate primarily based on changes in trade and share volume  the mix of trades of otc securities compared to listed securities and the clearance fees charged by clearing brokers 
employee compensation and benefits expense primarily consists of salaries and wages paid to administrative and customer service personnel and profitability based compensation  which includes compensation and benefits paid to market making and sales personnel based on their individual performance  and incentive compensation paid to all other employees based on our overall profitability 
profitability based compensation represented  and of total employee compensation and benefits expense for the years ended december   and respectively 
we have grown from employees at december  to and employees as of december  and  respectively 
approximately of our employees are directly involved in market making  sales or customer service activities 
compensation for employees engaged in market making and sales activities  the largest component of employee compensation and benefits  is determined primarily based on a percentage of gross trading profits net of expenses including payments for order flow  execution and clearance costs and overhead allocations 
employee compensation and benefits will  therefore  be affected by changes in payments for order flow  execution and clearance costs and the costs we allocate to employees engaged in market making and sales activities 
payments for order flow represent customary payments to broker dealers  in the normal course of business  for directing their order flow to us 
as a result of the new order handling rules implemented by the sec in  we changed our order flow payment policy from paying broker dealers for substantially all order executions  to paying broker dealers only for orders which provide us with a profit opportunity 
for example  we make payments on market orders  but do not pay on limit orders 
payments for order flow change as we modify our payment formulas and as our percentage of customers whose policy is not to accept payments for order flow varies 
execution and clearance fees primarily represent clearance fees paid to clearing brokers for otc and listed securities  transaction fees paid to nasdaq  and execution fees paid to third parties  primarily for executing trades in listed securities on the nyse and amex and for executing orders through electronic communications networks  commonly referred to as ecns 
execution and clearance fees are higher for listed securities than for otc securities 
due to our significant growth in share and trade volume  we have been able to negotiate favorable rates and volume discounts from clearing brokers and providers of execution services 
as a result of these lower rates and discounts and the increase in trade volume of otc securities as a percentage of total trade volume  execution and clearance fees per trade have decreased 
communications and data processing expense primarily consists of costs for obtaining stock market data and telecommunications services 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets purchased by us or financed under a capital lease  and the amortization of goodwill  which includes contingent consideration  primarily resulting from the acquisition of the listed securities market making businesses of trimark and tradetech securities  lp which we acquired in november occupancy and equipment rentals expense primarily consists of rental payments on office and equipment leases 
professional fees primarily consist of fees paid to computer programming and systems consultants  as well as legal fees and other professional fees 
business development expense primarily consists of advertising costs and marketing expenses  including travel and entertainment expenses and promotion costs 
interest on preferred units represents required interest payments on our mandatorily redeemable preferred a and b units at a rate approximating the federal funds rate 
on april   we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding preferred a units for million in cash 
on april   we redeemed million of preferred b units and  on july   we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to redeem all of the remaining outstanding preferred b units 
merger related expenses primarily consist of investment banking  legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with our merger with arbitrade holdings  llc this transaction closed in january other expenses primarily consist of administrative expenses and other operating costs incurred in connection with our business growth  as well as directors fees and restricted stock granted to directors in connection with the initial public offering 
income tax prior to our initial public offering  we were a limited liability company and were not subject to federal or state income taxes 
actual income tax expense represents income taxes incurred from july   the date of the reorganization  through december  and for the year ended december  this period is referred to as the post offering period 
our effective tax rate for the post offering period and pro forma effective tax rate for all periods prior to the post offering period differ from the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes  as well as nondeductible expenses  including the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of trimark and a portion of business development expenses and merger related expenses

additionally  we made cash payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively  in connection with our acquisitions of the listed securities market making businesses of trimark in and tradetech in the aggregate minimum rental commitments for are million 
we anticipate that we will meet our capital expenditure needs out of operating cash flows 
as registered broker dealers and market makers  knight and trimark are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c million and million  respectively  as of december  
these regulations also prohibit a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to its parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers  including knight and trimark  are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to its parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions  which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
at december   knight had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its required net capital of million and trimark had net capital of million  which was million in excess of its required net capital of million 
we used a portion of our capital resources before our initial public offering to pay interest on our issued and outstanding mandatorily redeemable preferred a and b units  and to make quarterly distributions to our members to meet their estimated income tax obligations on their share of our taxable income 
the preferred a and b units bore interest at a rate approximating the federal funds rate

in april  we redeemed a portion of the preferred b units for approximately million in cash 
we used million of the proceeds of our initial public offering to redeem all of the remaining outstanding preferred b units on july  painewebber capital inc  an affiliate of painewebber incorporated  loaned million to roundtable under a loan agreement dated as of june  roundtable used the proceeds from this loan to make distributions of undistributed profits to the members of roundtable before our reorganization from a limited liability company to a delaware corporation immediately before our initial public offering 
in connection with the dissolution of roundtable  we assumed all of roundtable s obligations under the loan 
we subsequently repaid the entire loan from our operating cash flows  making principal pre payments of million  million  million and million on september   october   december  and january   respectively 
we currently anticipate that available cash resources and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
in april  our board of directors approved a two for one stock split of our class a and class b common stock 
shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  received  in the form of a stock dividend  one additional share for each share held by them 
on may   the transfer agent distributed the additional shares 
all share and per share amounts presented in this document have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
on october   our board of directors approved a program to repurchase  over a period of up to eighteen months  up to million shares of our outstanding class a common stock up to a total aggregate amount not to exceed million

the largest investment is a interest in easdaq which we purchased for approximately million 
easdaq is a pan european stock market for international growth and technology companies 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields needed to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies had to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
we estimate that the total cost of our year project was approximately  to date  we have not experienced any material outages or failures as a result of year related issues 
we cannot make any assurances that we may not experience any such failures in the future 
we have finalized a business continuity plan and have formulated action steps to be taken in the event that a material year related failure should arise

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market making and trading activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility or changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
we employ an automated proprietary trading and risk management system which provides real time  on line risk management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by a constant review of trading positions 
for each trader  we have established a system whereby any trades that exceed pre determined limits are monitored by senior management as are individual and aggregate dollar and share position totals and real time profits and losses 
the management of trading positions is enhanced by review of mark to market valuations and or position summaries on a daily basis 
in the normal course of our market making business  we maintain inventories of exchange listed and otc securities 
the fair value of these securities at december  and was million and million  respectively  in long positions and million and million  respectively  in short positions 
the potential change in fair value  using a hypothetical decline in prices  is estimated to be a million loss and a million gain as of december  and  respectively  due to the offset of losses in long positions with gains in short positions 
the following table illustrates  for the period indicated  our average  highest and lowest month end inventory at market value based on both the aggregate and the net of the long and short positions of trading securities 
year ended december  aggregate of net of aggregate of net of aggregate of net of long and short long and short long and short long and short long and short long and short positions positions positions positions positions positions average month end       highest month end       lowest month end       beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout  there has been a sharp increase in the price volatility of many stocks  particularly of technology companies and companies that sell products or services via the internet 
this volatility has been coupled with record trading volume in many of these stocks  which are primarily listed on nasdaq 
customers eager to trade internet and technology stocks have flooded their brokers with larger numbers of orders  leading to large order imbalances  systems queues and backlogs 
during these extreme market conditions  many firms have implemented procedures that are designed to preserve the continuous execution of customers orders while also lessening the exposure of the firm to extraordinary market risk 
in the fourth quarter of  we modified our execution policies in response to these changes in the marketplace 
our current policy is to provide continuous automatic execution on orders of up to  shares for investors in over  nasdaq stocks under normal market conditions 
we reserve the right at our sole discretion to reduce  modify  suspend or cancel any of our guaranteed or automated order handling protocols  including automated price improvement and automatic execution  without prior notice on a stock by stock or customer by customer basis  when periods of extreme or unusual market conditions exist  risk management protocols so dictate  attempts are made to circumvent our automated execution size limitations  or we otherwise deem it appropriate 
for working capital purposes  we invest in money market funds or maintain interest bearing balances in our trading accounts with clearing brokers  which are classified as cash equivalents and receivable from clearing brokers  respectively  in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
these amounts do not have maturity dates or present a material market risk  as the balances are short term in nature and subject to daily repricing 
since its inception  neither knight trimark nor any of its subsidiaries has traded or otherwise transacted in derivatives
