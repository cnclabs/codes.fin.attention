accounting matters the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
effective january   the company must recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
as derivative instrument meeting certain conditions may be designated as a hedge of a specific exposure  accounting for changes in a derivative s fair value will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
any transition adjustments resulting from adopting this statement will be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle period 
as described under the heading quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below of this form k report  the company makes use of derivative instruments to hedge specific market risks

will have on its future consolidated financial statements or the amount of the cumulative adjustment that will be made upon adopting this new standard 
year the company experienced no interruption in  or failure of its normal business activities or operations as a result of year issues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk debt and debt related derivatives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term and long term debt with variable interest rates 
based on the overall interest rate exposure on variable rate debt at december  a hypothetical change in the interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately hedging activity the company engages in futures contracts agreements with certain of its production 
the company considers these to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in oil and gas sales 
in order to consider these futures contracts as hedges  i the company must designate the futures contract as a hedge of future production and ii the contract must reduce the company s exposure to the risk of changes in prices 
changes in the market value of futures contracts treated as hedges are not recognized in income until the hedged item is also recognized in income 
if the above criteria are not met  the company will record the market value of the contract at the end of each month and recognize a related gain or loss 
proceeds received or paid relating to terminated contracts or contracts that have been sold are amortized over the original contract period and reflected in oil and gas sales 
the company enters into hedging activities in order to secure an acceptable future price relating to a portion of future production 
the primary objective of the activities is to protect against decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the nymex light sweet crude oil and natural gas futures contracts 
the company has contracts which contain specific contracted prices swaps or price ranges collars that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract price or price ranges and the average nymex prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the average nymex price exceeds the contract price  the company pays the spread  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the average nymex price the company receives the spread

the fair value of the crude oil hedging contracts in place at december  resulted in a liability of  at december  the company s open forward position on its outstanding gas hedging contracts was  mcf per day with a floor price of per mcf through october the cost of the floor contract hedge is per mcf over the floor price 
the fair value of the natural gas hedging contracts in place at december  resulted in an asset of  price fluctuations and the volatile nature of markets despite the measures taken by the company to attempt to control price risk  the company remains subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and oil sold in the spot market 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond the company s control 
domestic oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimates and such revisions and if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
