commodity prices of the ferrous and non ferrous markets began to decline during the third and fourth quarters of the influx of foreign steel due to the depressed asian market caused domestic commodity pricing to plummet 
due to the lack of domestic steel production  many of the regional steel mills  which consume the registrant s ferrous product  had limited scrap purchasing during the fourth quarter 
the registrant s inventory volume increased due to the local dismantling of an automotive plant 
offsetting this quantity increase in inventory is a decrease in inventory market value 
the registrant estimates that these factors had a  adverse impact on its operations 
the gross margin was  representing a decrease of  or as a percentage to revenue a decrease 
a slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage to revenue from to was realized in the management services segment due to some fixed fee contracts which experienced store location growth during the year 
the recycling division experienced a decrease in gross margin as a percentage to revenue of due mainly to the declining commodity price index 
it is estimated that the decline in commodity values had an adverse gross margin impact on operations of approximately  the equipment sales leasing business incurred a decline in gross margins due to the changing mix of higher sales relative to the rental and leasing volume 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from the increase was primarily attributable to goodwill and non compete amortization related to two recent acquisitions

inventory increased  from  to  representing a 
increase 
the inventory of equipment and parts increased from  to  or a increase

as of december  the registrant s working capital deficit was  which represents a decrease of  from the total current assets increased  due to the  in accounts receivable and the  increase in cash 
the total current liabilities increased  affected primarily by total accounts payable increase of inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not and is not expected to have a significant impact on the registrant s operation in the near term 
the registrant has no long term fixed price contracts and the registrant believes it will be able to pass through most cost increases resulting from inflation to its customers 
the registrant is susceptible to the cyclical nature of the commodity business 
in response to these economic conditions  the registrant has focused on the management consulting area of the business and is working to liquidate inventories while efforts are made to enhance gross margins 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in june sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designed specifically as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a forecasted transaction 
the statement will not have an impact on the registrant s financial position or results of operations 
year risk factors in february  the registrant implemented its year project to address the potential problem with which substantially all users of automated data processing and information systems had to deal 
this problem is mainly with older systems with only two digits to represent the year  rather than the full four digits 
the fear was that older computer systems would not operate when the two digit year became in january the registrant uses primarily microsoft software  which was already year compliant 
the registrant s accounting system is a dos based system  which could have created the problem with 
the registrant in its endeavor to alleviate this dos based problem contracted with the programmer of the registrant to write software to prevent this potential problem 
the software upgrade was completed in february and the registrant tested the programs to verify working order 
by having the upgrade completed in february  the registrant had sufficient time to test systems to avert future problems 
in summary  the registrant s year project s goals and expectations were met and all necessary modifications and upgrades were in place 
the total costs incurred were less than  to ensure compliance
