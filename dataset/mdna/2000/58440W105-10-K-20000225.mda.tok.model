certain factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements  and are based on current expectations  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with such statements include the following acquisition related risks 
during fiscal year ended november   the company completed the terran acquisition 
in addition  the company has completed the acquisition of wired  inc and has also signed a definitive agreement to acquire digital origin  inc the transaction is subject to the approval of the stockholders of media inc and digital origin  inc 
and other customary closing conditions 
the company anticipates the merger will be completed in the first half of calendar the company s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the event the company fails to complete publicly announced acquisitions or to successfully integrate the business and operations of these acquisitions 
the company may continue in the future to acquire existing businesses  products  and technologies to enhance and expand its line of products 
such acquisitions may be material in size and in scope 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire  or profitably manage additional business or successfully integrate any acquired businesses into the company without substantial expenses  delays  or other operational or financial problems 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and factors  including increasing competition for attractive acquisition candidates in the company s markets  the technological enhancement and incorporation of acquired products into existing product lines and services  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  failure to retain key acquired personnel  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities of any acquired companies  the failure to achieve anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies  as well as the diversion of management s attention during the acquisition and integration process 
some or all of these special risks and factors may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly for a number of reasons  including new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing  and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
the company has also in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancements  and such delays may occur in the future 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and operating expense levels are based primarily on internal expectations of future revenue 
as a consequence  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
emerging markets 
the company is targeting the emerging market of new internet based broadcasters that are building streaming media web sites and businesses and institutions that are adding internet video to their web sites 
this market and the products utilized by these users are relatively new 
the company s success in this emerging market will depend on the rate at which the market develops and the company s ability to penetrate that market 
in addition  in fiscal  the company plans to begin targeting consumers who are looking to edit video at low cost and without complication 
the company believes this market will grow rapidly in the future as consumers increase their purchases of dv camcorders that connect directly to personal computers 
using a dv camcorder  a home pc and the internet  the company believes consumers will be able to capture  edit and stream video simply and easily 
the company s future growth will depend  in part  on the rate at which consumers purchase dv camcorders and adopt editing and streaming technology 
there can be no assurance that the use of digital video editing and streaming products  like the ones offered by the company  will expand among existing users of video production processes or the market for new users 
any failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance in these markets  as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with development and introduction of new products 
new product announcements by the company s competitors and by the company itself could have the effect of reducing customer demand for the company s existing products 
the introduction of new or enhanced products by the company also requires the company to manage the transitions from existing products 
new product introductions require the company to devote time and resources to the training of its sales channel in the features and target customers for such new products  which efforts could result in less selling efforts being made by the sales channel during such training period 
new product announcements or introductions could contribute to significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products and features in a timely manner to address customer requirements  respond to competitive offerings  adapt to new emerging industry standards and take advantage of new enabling technologies that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
the company plan in fiscal is to continue its investment in research and development  in connection with the company s development strategy 
any delay or failure of the company in developing additional new products or features for existing products or any failure of such new products or features to achieve market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
competition 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features and accelerate the release of new products 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with the company s products  including accom  inc  apple computer inc  avid technology  inc  discreet a division of autodesk  inc  fast electronic gmbh  matrox electronic systems ltd  pinnacle systems  inc  real networks inc  and sonic foundry  inc 
in addition  the company expects much larger vendors  such as matsushita electric industrial company ltd  microsoft corporation  and sony corporation  to develop and introduce digital editing systems that may compete with the company s products 
many of these current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
as a result  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable to or superior to the company s products  adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  or lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
in this regard  the company believes that it will continue to experience competitive pressure to reduce prices  particularly for its high data rate systems 
the company has historically realized higher gross profit on the sale of its high data rate systems than its entry level systems  and such continued competitive pricing pressure could result in lower sales and gross margin  which in turn could adversely affect the company s operating results 
dependence on and competition with apple computer  inc 
as a competitor  apple computer  inc apple could  in the future  inhibits the company s ability to develop its products that operate on the macintosh platform 
additionally  new products and enhancements to existing products from apple such as final cut pro could cause customers to delay purchases of the company s products or alter their purchase decision altogether 
furthermore  as the sole supplier of macintosh computers  any disruption in the availability of these computers could cause customers to defer or alter their purchase of the company s products 
the company relies on access to key information from apple to continue development of its products and any failure to continue supplying the company s engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and financial results 
dependence on microsoft corporation 
many of the company s products operate in the windows environment and the company s engineers depend upon access to information in advance from microsoft corporation microsoft 
any failure to continue supplying the company s engineers with this information could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and financial results 
dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
the company is dependent on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in its products 
the availability of many of these components is dependent on the company s ability to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements  and certain components used by the company have been subject to industry wide shortages 
the company does not carry significant inventories of these components and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company s inventories would be adequate to meet the company s production needs during any interruption of supply 
the company s inability to develop alternative supply sources  if required  or a reduction or stoppage in supply  could delay product shipments until new sources of supply become available  and any such delay could adversely affect the company s business and operating results in any given period 
dependence on propriety technology 
the company s ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
the company has in the past received  and may in the future continue to receive  communications suggesting that its products may infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
the company s policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that these or other future communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
risks of third party claims of infringement 
there has been substantial industry litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to the company or to enforce trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by the company  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
for a description of certain pending litigation instituted against the company  see item  legal proceedings and note b to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
any such litigation could be costly and a diversion of management s attention  which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on resellers 
the company relies primarily on its worldwide network of independent vars to distribute and sell its content creation products to end users 
the company s resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases products that are competitive with the company s products 
in addition  many of these vars are small organizations with limited capital resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide them with adequate levels of support  or that the company s efforts to expand its var network will be successful  any significant failure of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
reliance on international sales 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  less effective enforcement of proprietary rights  currency exchange fluctuations  generally longer collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international resellers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
the company s international sales are also subject to more seasonal fluctuation than domestic sales 
in this regard  the traditional summer vacation period  which occurs during the company s third fiscal quarter  may result in a decrease in sales  particularly in europe 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international operations and consequently  on the company s business and operating results 
internet based sales 
in fiscal  the company implemented e commerce systems allowing customers to purchase the company s products directly from its web site 
although the portion of revenue derived from its e commerce web site was less than five percent in fiscal  the company anticipates revenue derived from its e commerce web site to ramp up in fiscal there can be no assurances that the company s customers will continue to purchase the company s products from its web site or that the web site will not experience technical difficulties thereby causing customers to delay purchases 
any significant technical difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
competition for employees with the skills required by the company is intense in the geographic areas in which the company s operations are located 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially in research and development 
euro conversion 
on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of january   the transition to the euro will be complete 
the company has operations within the european union and has prepared for the euro conversion 
the company does not expect the costs associated with the transition to be material 
however  the overall effect of the transition to the euro may have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company is not a party to any derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no

all of the company s investments are in short term  investment grade commercial paper  certificates of deposit and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on the company s books 
accordingly  the company believes that the market risk of such investments is minimal 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the area of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s business in europe is conducted in local currency 
in asia  business is conducted in us currency

however  the company estimates that any market risk associated with its foreign operations is not significant and is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition
