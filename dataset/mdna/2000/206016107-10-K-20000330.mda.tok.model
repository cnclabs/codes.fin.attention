item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception on september   the company has been primarily engaged in the design  development and marketing of minimally invasive devices for reproductive medical applications 
conceptus  inc is developing stop  an innovative medical device designed to provide a non surgical alternative to surgical tubal ligation  the leading form of contraception worldwide 
data from the united nations show that worldwide  of reproductive couples using contraception rely on surgical tubal ligation 
a survey performed by the centers for disease control indicates that surgical tubal ligation is the most prevalent form of contraception in the us  and that of women age have had a tubal ligation 
an estimated  surgical tubal ligations are performed each year in the us  of which are performed in a hospital or surgi center and require general anesthesia 
the company has a limited history of operations and has experienced significant operating losses since inception 
operating losses are expected to continue for at least the next several years as the company continues to expend substantial resources to fund clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  to conduct research and development  and to develop appropriate marketing and distribution systems for the stop device 
the company continues to devote significant financial and human resources on the development of its stop non surgical permanent contraception device for women 
stop is designed to be a less invasive  safer  and less costly alternative to tubal ligation 
the stop device is designed to achieve contraception by elliciting a tissue response that occludes the fallopian tubes 
a stop micro coil is placed into each fallopian tube in a minute procedure  which can be performed in an office setting 
the procedure does not require general anesthesia and does not require any cutting of the body 
additionally  stop does not employ hormones or drugs for contraception thus it is intended to be an alternative to long term use of oral contraceptives  iuds or hormonal implants 
because the stop device is intended for permanent contraception  the feasibility of device removal and possible return to fertility has not been investigated 
the mechanism of contraception of the stop device is a combination of a blocking the fallopian tube to prevent meeting of sperm and egg  and b transformation of the fallopian tube architecture to an environment that does not support conception 
results from completed histological analysis in fallopian tubes with properly placed devices demonstrate that the stop device has become completely incorporated into the fallopian tube tissue with a proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibrotic tissue interlaced throughout the device 
conceptus believes these two combined effects of the stop device may provide effective long term contraception 
in july  the company commenced a phase ii clinical study of preliminary safety and effectiveness of stop 
the phase ii study involves device placement in fertile women who desire permanent contraception and will be monitored for a minimum of two years 
in the current phase ii clinical trial there is a three month waiting period after placement of the stop device before it can be relied upon for contraception 
during this time  alternative contraception must be used 
at the three month follow up visit  an x ray is taken and a pressure test is performed to see if the tubes have been occluded by the stop devices 
if all criteria have been met  a doctor can recommend that a woman can begin relying on stop for contraception 
the three month waiting period is a conservative estimate of the time required for the stop device to effectuate its mechanism of contraception 
the company continues to perform clinical studies to determine the feasibility of reducing this waiting period 
as of february   the women in the phase ii study have accumulated woman months of effectiveness with no reported pregnancies 
additionally  these women in the phase ii study have accumulated woman months of wear with a low rate of adverse events 
these adverse events all involved improper device placement and resulted in the inability of the patient to rely on the stop device for contraception 
the company believes the rate of occurrence of these types of adverse events can be reduced to an insignificant rate with physician education and experience and design evolution of the stop delivery system 
us regulatory clearance of the stop device is subject to the food drug administration fda pre market approval pma process 
accordingly  conceptus intends to complete an international pivotal trial with clinical sites in the us  europe  and australia 
the company expects to conduct the pivotal trial in sites 
in march  the company obtained approval from the fda to commence a patient pivotal trial of the stop device 
the company estimates that pma approval of the stop device may be obtained in the company also plans to seek regulatory clearance for the stop device in certain international markets before and after fda approval 
in support of these regulatory approvals the company intends to seek the ce mark for stop in the company s other products  the ttac product line  starrt falloposcopy system  and the era and futura resectoscope sleeves have generated limited sales to date 
prior to the july restructuring  the company had sought to license or acquire products that were complementary to these products in order to develop a critical mass of medical devices to justify the hiring of a direct  specialty sales force 
failing to build a line of products that would enable cost effective  direct marketing to the interventional gynecology market  the company implemented a restructuring plan in july when the company assessed that the near term market potential of these products did not justify a direct  specialty salesforce 
this restructuring reduced the number of employees by approximately fifty from seventy two at the beginning of by eliminating all sales and marketing personnel  the manufacturing function  and most administrative personnel 
as a result of these actions the company recorded an one time restructuring charge of about million in the second quarter of prior to the restructuring the company sold its products to us and international markets through a limited number of distributors who resell to physicians and hospitals 
sales to distributors were made on open credit terms and may include purchase discounts 
sales in and were through a small direct sales force which was eliminated in july  and distributors  on open credit terms and consisted of commercial shipments of ttac  starrt  era and futura products 
the era and futura resectoscope sleeve allow the use of physiologic solution when performing gynecological and urologic procedures  which increases the safety of resection procedures by eliminating the risk of dilutional hyponatremia  a complication that can lead to serious heart  lung  and brain disorders 
the company received k clearance for its futura resectoscope sleeve for urology applications in the first quarter of in september  the company received k clearance for its era resectoscope sleeve for gynecological procedures 
also in september  the company entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with imagyn  formerly urohealth  inc  granting imagyn an exclusive  worldwide license to distribute products for urological applications of the resectoscope sleeve 
since december   imagyn has not purchased any of the company s products 
as of june   this distribution agreement with imagyn was terminated by imagyn 
the company is actively seeking sales and marketing partners to distribute the era resectoscope sleeve for gynecologic applications in the united states and internationally 
given the company s focus on the stop product  the company is not actively marketing or manufacturing the ttac  starrt  and the era and futura products 
until the company is successful in establishing marketing and sales partners to distribute these products  revenues are expected to decrease from levels 
the company continues to evaluate possible marketing and third party manufacturing arrangements for these products 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors  the rate at which the company establishes domestic and international distributors or marketing partners  actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the timing and size of distributor purchases  the progress of clinical trials  and the introduction of competitive products for diagnosis and treatment of the female reproductive system 
the company believes that development of the tac  starrt  and era and futura products has reached a logical stage sufficient to enable distribution to the marketplace 
therefore  the company does not expect to expend significant resources on further development of these products nor does the company plan on expending significant resources marketing these products without a significant marketing and distribution partner 
future sales of the t tac  starrt  era  and futura products are expected to be very low or decrease from current levels until effective distribution partners are secured 
in october  the company received notification from the national association of securities dealer s inc nasd that due to the decline of the company s stock price  the company was not in compliance  throughout the third quarter of  with certain listing maintenance requirements of the nasdaq national market 
in november  the company s common stock satisfied these maintenance requirements with a closing bid price of at least per share for ten consecutive trading days 
while these maintenance requirements were satisfied within the required ninety day period required by the nasd  there can be no assurance that company s common stock will stay in compliance the maintenance requirements 
if delisting were to occur  the company expects that trading of its common stock would be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the over the market in what is commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
results of operations years ended december   and in  sales decreased to an immaterial level as the company ceased all marketing and distribution of the ttac  starrt  and era and futura products to focus solely on the stop product 
the company expects revenues to remain immaterial in as the company continues to seek regulatory approval of the stop device in various countries 
sales in decreased by million to million from million in as a result of the lack of orders from significant distribution partners combined with the elimination  in july  of all sales and marketing personnel 
sales to domestic customers represented   and of sales in   and  respectively 
in  cost of sales decreased to an immaterial level as the company ceased all marketing and distribution of the ttac  starrt  and era and futura products to focus solely on the stop product 
the company  expects cost of sales to remain immaterial in as the company continues to seek regulatory approval of the stop device in various countries 
in  cost of sales decreased million to million from million in due to the absence of approximately million of expenses incurred in for the purchase of manufacturing rights for the microgyn sleeve products combined with the elimination of all manufacturing activities in july research and development r d expenses  which include clinical  regulatory  and quality assurance expenses were million in and and were million in r d expenses are expected to increase significantly in as the company commences the pivotal trial of the stop device and scales up its pilot manufacturing operations 
the decrease in r d expenses in was due to reduced development and clinical activities associated with the microgyn  ttac  and starrt products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
sg a expenses decreased in and as a result of the corporate restructuring effected in july  where all sales and marketing functions were eliminated and administrative personnel were significantly reduced 
however  as the company implements its international marketing efforts for the stop device  sg a expenses are expected to increase significantly from the current levels 
net interest and investment income were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of lower average cash balances due to the utilization of cash for operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  net loss decreased to million in from million in net loss was million in at december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company had research credit carryforwards of approximately  as of december  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards described above will expire  if not utilized  at various dates beginning in the years through utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see risk factors limited operating history  anticipated future losses 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s cash expenditures have significantly exceeded its sales  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million at december  at december   conceptus had cash  cash equivalents and investments of approximately million compared with million at december  the decrease in was primarily due to million used in operations  to fund increasing levels of research and development of the company s stop non surgical permanent contraception device and expansion of the stop phase ii clinical study 
capital expenditures in were immaterial 
in capital expenditures were million and were primarily leasehold improvements and related furniture and fixtures for a new building 
as a result of the company s restructuring in july  the company subleased this new building and related furniture and fixtures  for the entire lease term  at amounts greater than the cost of improvements and related furniture and fixtures 
capital expenditures in were million 
conceptus believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to complete enrollment in the stop pivotal trial but does not currently have sufficient capital resources to fund completion of the pivotal trial nor does it have sufficient funds to successfully commercialize the stop product 
however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  execution and implementation of partnering arrangements  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources devoted to developing  manufacturing and marketing the company s products 
accordingly  the company may require additional financing and  therefore  may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of year in prior years the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year compliant 
in  the company completed its testing and remediation of critical information systems and as of february   has not experienced any disruptions in information systems due to the inability of systems to properly process the year the company will continue to monitor critial information systems to ensure continued operation of such systems 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
early state of stop development uncertainty of product development and lack of long term follow up data 
the company has not yet completed development of the stop contraception device and expects to increase research and development expenditures as the company implements design changes in pursuit of a commercially viable design 
to obtain revenues from the stop device the company must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval of  manufacture and market the stop device 
the company has demonstrated technical feasiblity in phase ii clinical trials of the stop device and anticipates significantly more expenditures to complete a large pivotal clinical trial  prior to commercialization 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will be successfully completed 
additionally  until the development and clinical testing processes are complete  there can be no assurance the stop device will perform in the manner anticipated  or that the results observed in animal and human clinical trials will be experienced in long term use 
the first phase ii placement of the device was in july  and as of february  a total of women have had a successful stop procedure  thus the company has obtained limited clinical data on the safety and efficacy of the product 
because the company has not yet obtained any long term safety or efficacy data there can be no assurance that long term safety and efficacy data when collected will be consistent with the results obtained in early phase ii clinical trials nor can there be any assurance that the stop device can be successfully used by a wide range of patients on a long term basis as a safe and effective permanent contraceptive method 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s products have generated limited revenue to date 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s existing or future products will gain any significant degree of market acceptance among physicians  patients and healthcare payors  even if reimbursement and necessary international and united states regulatory approvals are obtained 
the company believes that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of the company s products  and there can be no assurance that any such recommendations or endorsements will be obtained 
the company believes that physicians will not use the company s products unless they determine  based on clinical data and other factors  that these systems are an attractive alternative to other means of diagnosing and treating diseases and disorders of the female reproductive system and that the products offer clinical utility in a cost effective manner 
acceptance among physicians will also depend upon the company s ability to train interventional gynecologists and other potential users of the company s products in new interventional techniques and upon the willingness of such persons to learn these new techniques 
failure of the company s products to achieve significant market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience  emerging market 
the company has only limited experience marketing and selling its products in commercial quantities 
interventional gynecology is an emerging medical market with widely varying practice patterns 
therefore  there is no proven distribution channel for marketing the company s current and future products in the united states or internationally 
while the company is committed to establishing an effective distribution channel for its products  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the failure to establish and maintain an effective worldwide distribution for the company s current or future products  or to retain qualified sales personnel to support commercial sales of the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon transcervical tubal access and catheterization products 
the company s initial commercial products  the ttac and starrt falloposcopy systems  have generated limited sales to date 
current applications for these systems include accessing  diagnosing and treating diseases and disorders of the fallopian tubes 
expanding the number of applications for these products will require additional development and  in certain cases  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
limited operating history  anticipated future losses 
the company has a limited history of operations 
since its inception in september  the company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its ttac  starrt falloposcopy and stop systems and  since  the era and futura product lines 
the company has generated only limited revenues and has only limited experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling its products in commercial quantities 
the company has experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects its operating losses to continue for at least the next several years as it continues to expend substantial resources in funding clinical trials in support of regulatory and reimbursement approvals  expansion of manufacturing  marketing and sales activities and research and product development or acquisition 
due to the expense and unpredictable nature of these activities  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
whether the company can successfully manage the transition to a large scale commercial enterprise will depend upon a number of factors  including obtaining selected regulatory and reimbursements approvals for its existing or potential products  establishing its commercial manufacturing capability  developing its us marketing and selling capabilities and establishing an international network 
failure to make such a transition successfully would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on patents and protection of proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively will depend substantially on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of its technology 
there can be no assurance that the company s issued patents  any future patents that may be issued as a result of the company s united states or foreign patent applications  or the patents under which the company has license rights  will offer any degree of protection to the company s products against competitive products 
there can be no assurance that any patents that may be issued or licensed to the company or any of the company s patent applications will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitors  many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with the company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the united states or in international markets 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office uspto to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  uspto interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect the company s trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or interference proceedings involving the company will result in substantial expense to the company and significant diversion of effort by the company s technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which the company may become a party could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties or require the company to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to the company on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a patent issued to target therapeutics  a unit of boston scientific corporation bsc  and subject to target s license to the company  which contains claims relating to the design of the company s variable softness micro catheters the target patent  has been the subject of four reexamination proceedings in the uspto 
following the completion of the first of such proceedings  the uspto issued a reexamination certificate and confirmed the patentability 
after the uspto s review of petitions for second  third and fourth re examinations  target received notice from the uspto that it had reaffirmed the patentability of the claims of the target patent 
in addition  in november  target filed a lawsuit in united states district court against scimed life systems  inc scimed  a subsidiary of bsc  and cordis endovascular systems  inc cordis  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc  alleging infringement of a target patent relating to variable stiffness in microcatheters  and seeking damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against sales of such companies products believed to be infringing the target patent 
the defendants responded by challenging the validity of the target patent  denying infringement and raising other defenses 
in may  the district court granted target s motion for an injunction prohibiting the defendants from continuing to sell the products alleged to infringe the patent 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed the injunction pending an appeal by the defendants 
upon the merger between target and bsc  the lawsuit was dismissed as to scimed 
subsequently  the court of appeals vacated the preliminary injuction 
the lawsuit was dismissed as to cordis pursuant to a settlement agreement signed in january any invalidation of the target patent could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
legislation is pending in congress that  if enacted in its present form  would limit the ability of medical device manufacturers in the future to obtain patents on surgical and medical procedures that are not performed by  or as a part of  devices or compositions that are themselves patentable 
while the company cannot predict whether the legislation will be enacted  or precisely what limitations will result from the law if enacted  any limitation or reduction in the patentability of medical and surgical methods and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to protect its proprietary methods and procedures 
in addition to patents  the company relies on trade secrets and technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
the company typically requires its employees  consultants and advisors to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with the company 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by the company during the course of the individual s relationship with the company is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties  except in specific circumstances 
the agreements also generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to the company shall be the exclusive property of the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will not be breached or that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that competitors will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary technology  or that conceptus can meaningfully protect its rights in unpatented proprietary technology 
government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including the medical devices used in the company s stop  ttac  and starrt and era and futura products  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities  both in the united states and internationally 
in the united states  the principal regulatory authorities are the food and drug administration fda and corresponding state agencies  such as the california department of health services cdhs 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the fda requires companies that wish to market a new medical device or an existing medical device for use for a new indication to obtain either a premarket notification clearance under section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act k or a premarket approval pma prior to the introduction of such product into the market 
in addition  material changes to medical devices are also subject to fda review and clearance or approval 
if a medical device manufacturer or distributor can establish  among other things  that a device is substantially equivalent in intended use and technological characteristics to certain legally marketed devices  for which the fda has not required a pma  the manufacturer or distributor may seek clearance from the fda to market the device by filing a k 
though generally believed to be a shorter  less costly regulatory path than a pma  the k may need to be supported by appropriate data establishing to the satisfaction of the fda the claim of substantial equivalence to the predicate device 
in addition  the fda may require review by an advisory panel as a condition for k clearances  which can further lengthen the regulatory process 
the pma approval process can take several years from initial filing and requires the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information 
there can be no assurance that any future products or applications developed by the company will not require approval under the more lengthy and expensive pma process 
if the company is required to obtain approval for any products pursuant to the pma procedure or  if the k process with respect to any products is extended for a considerable length of time  the commencement of commercial sales of the company s products will be delayed substantially 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary k clearances or pma or other approvals to market its products for the intended uses on a timely basis  if at all  and delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  regulatory clearances  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
sales of medical devices outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance  and requirements for licensing may differ significantly from fda requirements 
the european union has promulgated rules which require manufacturers of medical products to obtain the right to affix to their products the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european union medical device directives 
the iso series of standards for quality operations has been developed to ensure that companies know the standards of quality to which they must adhere to receive european union certification 
iso certification is one of the ce mark certification requirements 
failure to receive the right to affix the ce mark will prohibit the company from selling such product in member countries of the european union after in conjunction with the company s restructuring in july  the company elected to let its iso certification lapse 
the company plans to become iso compliant and obtain the ce mark in late regulatory approvals  if granted  may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which the company s products may be marketed 
in addition  in order for companies to obtain such approvals  the fda and certain foreign regulatory authorities impose numerous additional requirements with which medical device manufacturers must comply 
fda enforcement policy strictly prohibits the promotion of approved medical devices for uses other than those specifically cleared for marketing by the fda 
the company will be required to adhere to applicable fda regulations regarding good manufacturing practices gmp and similar regulations in other countries  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
ongoing compliance with gmp and other applicable regulatory requirements will be monitored through periodic inspections by federal and state agencies  including the fda and the cdhs  and by comparable agencies in other countries 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new government regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s products 
the company cannot predict the impact  if any  such changes might have on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost associated with the treatment of patients 
although reimbursement for catheterization and hysteroscopy procedures has generally been available in the united states  there can be no assurance that such reimbursement will continue to be available 
if fda clearance or approval is received for new products  third party reimbursement for these products will be dependent upon decisions by individual health maintenance organizations  private insurers and other payors 
however  there can be no assurance that such procedure codes will remain available or that the reimbursement under these codes will be adequate 
given the efforts to control and decrease health care costs in recent years  there can be no assurance that any reimbursement will be sufficient to permit the company to achieve or maintain profitability 
the company could also be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of government or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent that any such changes affect reimbursement for therapeutic or diagnostic catheterization procedures or hysteroscopy procedures in which the company s products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payors for procedures in which the company s products are used  or adverse changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance of the company s products in international markets may be dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored and private healthcare insurance 
obtaining reimbursement approvals can require to months or longer 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain reimbursement in any country within a particular time  for a particular amount  or at all 
failure to obtain such approvals could have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the company s products in the international markets in which the company is seeking approvals and could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales  business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition  uncertainty of technological change 
the medical device industry is highly competitive 
the company expects competition for devices to diagnose and treat female reproductive disorders to increase 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than the company and have greater resources and expertise in research and development  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and marketing 
certain of these companies are developing and marketing devices for the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the female reproductive system and others may choose to enter this market at a later date 
additionally  certain smaller companies are developing alternative catheter based systems for the diagnosis and treatment of female reproductive disorders that may compete directly with the company s systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than those developed by the company or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against such competitors based on its abilities to manufacture  market and sell its products 
as the company commercializes its stop system  it expects to compete against other surgical procedures for permanent contraception  mechanical devices and other contraceptive methods 
the company also competes with other companies for clinical sites to conduct trials 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the length of time required for product development and regulatory approval plays an important role in a company s competitive position 
consequently  the company s success will depend in part on its ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development and commercialization of new products 
product development involves a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successfully products 
the company believes that it competes favorably with respect to these factors  although there can be no assurance that it will continue to do so and that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited manufacturing experience and reliance on third party manufacturers 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing its products in commercial quantities 
if the company is successful in estabilishing distribution partners for its products the company plans to increase internal maufacturing operations as well as utilize third party manufacturers to manufacture the products 
the company has identified candidates that it believes could adequately produce the products with the appropriate quality and sufficient volumes 
however  third party manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company and its third party manufacturers will not encounter manufacturing difficulties  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon sole source suppliers  lack of contractual arrangements 
conceptus purchases both raw materials used in its products and finished goods from various suppliers and may rely on single sources for some items 
the company does not have formal supply contracts with several key vendors and  accordingly  no assurance can be made that such firms will continue to supply the company with such raw materials or finished goods in sufficient quantities  or at all 
delays associated with any future raw materials or finished goods shortages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly as the company scales up its manufacturing activities in support of international commercial sales and  to the extent that fda approvals are received  united states commercial sales 
possible future capital requirements 
conceptus believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations through however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources devoted to developing  manufacturing and marketing the company s products 
the company s capital requirements will also depend on  among other things  the resources required to expand manufacturing capacity and facilities requirements and the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing within this time frame and  therefore  may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability risk and recalls  limited insurance coverage 
the manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid significant product liability claims and potential related adverse publicity 
the company currently maintains product liability insurance with coverage limits of  per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of  which the company believes is comparable to that maintained by other companies of similar size serving similar markets 
however  there can be no assurance that product liability claims in connection with clinical trials or sale of the company s products will not exceed such insurance coverage limits  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company may require increased product liability coverage as its products are commercialized 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage  or a recall of the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a number of key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success will also depend on its ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
the company faces intense competition for qualified personnel  many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
furthermore  the company relies on the services of several medical and scientific consultants  all of whom are employed on a full time basis by hospitals or academic or research institutions 
such consultants are therefore not available to devote their full time or attention to the company s affairs 
reliance on target therapeutic s license 
bsc may be able to exercise influence over the business and financial affairs of the company 
in april  bsc completed the acquisition of target  by merging target as a wholly owned subsidiary 
certain of the company s products are based upon patents and other intellectual property licensed from target  on an exclusive basis within the field of reproductive physiology 
in the event that such target patents are at any time invalidated  the company s proprietary position in the marketplace would be severely compromised and the company s competitors could have the ability to incorporate the target technology in their products 
in addition  should the target technology licensed to the company be found to infringe upon a third party s technology  the company s sale of products based on such infringing target technology could be limited 
finally  in the event that the company materially breaches the terms of its license from target  target will have the right to terminate the license 
any such termination of this license would deprive the company of the right to develop or sell products based on the licensed technology  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential fluctuations in future quarterly results 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and will depend upon  among other factors  actions relating to regulatory and reimbursement matters  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  progress of clinical trials and introduction of competitive products 
volatility of stock price 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the company s stock price has in the past been  and will likely in the future be  subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant stock price volatility 
in october  the company received notification from the national association of securities dealer s inc nasd that due to the decline of the company s stock price  the company was not in compliance  throughout the third quarter of  with certain listing maintenance requirements of the nasdaq national market 
in november  the company s common stock satisfied these maintenance requirements with a closing bid price of at least per share for ten consecutive trading days 
while these maintenance requirements were satisfied within the required ninety day period required by the nasd  there can be no assurance that company s common stock will stay in compliance the maintenance requirements 
if delisting were to occur  the company expects that trading of its common stock would be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the over the counter market 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly held medical device companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  fda and international regulatory actions  changes in reimbursement levels  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company or others  changes in healthcare policy in the united states and internationally  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding the company  its competitors or the medical device industry generally  and changes in general market conditions may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
effect of certain charter and bylaw provisions  shareholder rights plan 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
certain of these provisions allow the company to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors 
in addition  the company has adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the stockholder rights plan  and the charter and bylaw provisions described above  may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash balances in excess of short term operating needs are invested in highly liquid  short term government securities and high quality commercial paper 
however  due to the short term and high quality nature of these instruments  the company believes these financial instruments are exposed to a low level of interest rate risk
