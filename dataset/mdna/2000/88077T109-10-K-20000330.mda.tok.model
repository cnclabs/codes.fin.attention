item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following table shows the revenue and gross profits loss for the company s products years ended december  thousands revenue optical networking equipment    design services    digital signal processors dsp   video network products  other  gross profit loss optical networking equipment    design services   digital signal processors dsp  video network products other  revenues although sales of optical networking equipment in increased from levels  sales in both and  as compared to  reflect the company s refocusing on non far east markets and the extension of its technology and products into telecommunications markets for public network access equipment 
in addition  the company s financial condition resulted in difficulties in obtaining necessary component parts and created uncertainty as to the company s ability to meet delivery requirements 
therefore  existing and potential customers became reluctant to place new orders with the company 
revenues from optical networking equipment in declined dramatically from sales  which had been largely related to sales to korean customers 
the decline in revenues was due to the decline in sales to the korean market reflecting the financial condition of the asian region 
revenues from design services declined in as compared to during the negotiation of the sale of certain engineering services operations to cadence and preparation for closing the transaction  the company was limited in its ability to engage in new design services projects 
therefore  as existing projects were completed  the company experienced a decline in revenues from such services 
engineering service revenues in approximated the level of growth of the services business in was also constrained somewhat by the concentration of resources on dsp product development 
dsp products  primarily those based on texas instruments components  decreased in as compared to after having increased 
unavailability of components and customer uncertainty over future availability were the primary causes of the decline in these revenues 
the year included the launch of development tools for the texas instruments components and end products with powerful computing and signal processing capabilities 
revenues from video network products declined in as compared to as a result of management s decision to de emphasize this product line 
video network product revenues in increased over due to the first full year of availability of a redesigned product 
other revenues consist primarily of the voice and data switching products used in air traffic control applications  which have declined in strategic significance to the company and which are no longer actively promoted or pursued 
gross profit loss gross loss from optical networking equipment in reflects the effect of low production levels for the company s manufacturing operations due to lower sales in the lower production levels resulted in unabsorbed overhead of approximately million in in the fourth quarter of the company reduced the carrying value of its inventory by approximately million 
this adjustment was based on cost variances and a periodic review of the components of inventory in relation to anticipated sales and production and product design changes  as well as current market prices for components and completed products 
in addition  gross profit reflects the effect of pricing concessions amounting to approximately  these concessions were granted to a particular customer due to significant past and potential business with that customer 
gross profit decreased in from due to the significant decline in optical networking equipment sales 
the high level optical networking equipment shipments in supported an economic production rate in manufacturing operations  a rate which was not sustained in or the negative gross profit on these products in included  of under absorbed overhead 
at the production levels of  under absorbed overhead for these products was  all attributable to the first half year when production volume had not yet increased 
due to the cadence transaction discussed above  the company was required to maintain certain minimum staffing levels within its design services operations  irrespective of the amount of billable activity 
accordingly  certain costs were incurred without the revenues normally associated with such costs 
the failure of the cadence transaction to close also required the company to reduce staffing levels within the design services operation  which resulted in certain severance and termination costs 
additionally  in order to stabilize and retain the remaining staff  the company was required to incur additional costs in the form of salary adjustments and retention bonuses 
costs related to these items amounted to approximately  during engineering services gross profit maintained a similar percentage of sales in and and respectively 
dsp products contributed positive gross profit for the first time in as revenues grew to a level which allowed for a characteristic margin 
this gross profit declined in as a result of lower sales levels 
engineering development e d expenses e d expense decreased to  in  as compared to  in and  in in all three years  certain amounts of software development costs were capitalized 
including those amounts  the total e d expenditures were   and  respectively  in the years  and total e d expenditures by product line were distributed as follows years ended december  thousands optical networking products    cs    digital signal processor dsp  video network products   other  capitalized software development costs   e d expense    during  the company incurred engineering and development costs of approximately  related to its cs intelligent switching platform 
the company has completed or suspended all development activities related to this project and accordingly does not currently plan to incur engineering and development costs related to it subsequent to the third quarter of all e d costs related to this project have been expensed 
in addition  engineering and development activities related to dsp and video network products have been reduced so as to focus on near term sales opportunities related to the company s optical networking products 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased  or  between and and  or  between and these reductions are the result of lower sales levels and the company s efforts to reduce selling and administrative expense  including the closing of certain offices and staff reductions 
such expenses in include approximately  from an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated costs of  related to a certain shareholder suit see legal proceedings  legal costs of approximately  related to the cadence transaction and financing transactions during the third quarter of  and approximately  related to the adjustment of the carrying value of certain assets previously utilized in the company s video network products business 
selling and administrative expenses in include  of warranty expense  primarily the extra costs of start up and first year operations of two major installations of the sonetlynx product in korea and on the alyeska pipeline 
the company estimates that the usual level of warranty expenses would have been approximately  but for special startup difficulties caused by distance  cultural differences and unusual technical characteristics 
asset write downs in accordance with the evolving focus of the company s primary technologies  products and markets and forward growth plans  and in accordance with the company s accounting policies  including reviews of realizability of its long term assets  including goodwill  the company wrote off the september  balance of  of goodwill from the acquisition in of intelect inc  which at that time was primarily engaged in the supply of communications systems for air traffic control and air defense installations  and is presently operating as intelect network technologies  emphasizing the sonetlynx and fibretrax product lines 
the writeoff decision was determined by the recent loss of three major identified business opportunities  the absence of significant identified future opportunities and business combinations which strengthened competitors  all leading the company to reassess the outlook for the air traffic control business segment 
the company concluded that the outlook for future business would not support a forecast of revenue and contribution margin adequate to liquidate inventories and support amortization of the goodwill asset 
accounts and notes receivable from the company s korean distributor  and relating to the sales of the company s products in korea  totaled  at the end of september  compared to  at december   from which  was collected and to which  of shipments were added during the company was advised  at a meeting in october   of the distributor s illiquidity and inability to maintain any certain schedule of payments of receivables

o accounts receivable were a source of funding due to  collections from customers in excess of new shipments and billings 
o inventory decreased  o accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  o other assets  consisting primarily of deferred financing costs  decreased  o the non cash charges consist primarily of  of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets   of non cash losses from retirement of debt and  of amortization of deferred financing costs 
investing activities investments during were primarily  of fixed asset additions and  of capitalized product enhancements and advancements related to optical networking products  offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
the fixed asset additions were concentrated in computers  software  and test equipment to support engineering activities  and manufacturing equipment for new products 
financing activities prior to the completion of the series of financing transactions discussed above  the company experienced difficulties through out in obtaining adequate financing to support its operations  especially beginning in the third quarter of because of these difficulties the company did not have access to working capital in the amounts or within the timeframes it had anticipated 
accordingly  the company was unable to complete and ship certain orders in its backlog within time frames originally anticipated and was impaired in its ability to pursue new orders due to the uncertainty regarding scheduled delivery dates 
in march and april of the company issued series e convertible preferred stock for proceeds of million 
shortly after the completion of these transactions  the company and the holders of the series e preferred stock as well as holders of series c and d convertible preferred stock  became involved in a dispute regarding alleged violations of certain representations and covenants by the holders of the preferred stock and the company s refusal to effect conversions of the preferred stock into common stock 
subsequently  all such disputes were resolved and settled 
pursuant to these settlements the company issued approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for all of the series c  d  and e preferred stock 
as of december  no such series of preferred stock are outstanding 
while these disputes were outstanding the company was  for all practical purposes  precluded from raising other forms of equity capital 
accordingly  in order to raise additional capital the company had arranged the sale of a portion of its engineering design services conducted by its wholly owned subsidiary  dna enterprises  inc the company had negotiated the sale of these operations to cadence design systems  inc cadence for million in cash 
the company and counsel believe cadence and the company signed and delivered an asset purchase agreement to consummate the transaction 
concurrently with this transaction  the company had negotiated a restructuring of its debts with its primary lenders 
the transaction was scheduled to close on july  despite the company having met all conditions to closing  cadence failed to close the transaction and  therefore  the company believes breached the agreement which had been reached between the parties

subsequent to the failure of the cadence transaction to close the company negotiated a restructuring of its debt obligations with st 
james capital l p 
and sjmb l 
p 
collectively st 
james and with coastal 
pursuant to the restructuring  the company exchanged an aggregate of million of accrued interest and principal due under notes payable to st 
james for approximately million shares of common stock 
st 
james also received the right to convert any or all remaining balances under the note into common stock at a rate equal to the greater of and of the market price of the common stock at the time of the conversion 
in the restructuring the company also exchanged an aggregate of million of accrued interest and principal due to coastal for approximately million shares of common stock 
all remaining amounts outstanding to coastal were converted into an amended and restated revolving credit facility 
the facility provides for total borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base as defined in the agreement 
in december  the company and coastal agreed to convert million outstanding under the agreement into million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million additional shares at an exercise price of per share

in january and june the company issued  in a private placement  approximately million shares of common stock for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
conclusion although the company has not yet produced positive cash flow from operations  it has made significant process during in reducing recurring expenditures 
actions which have contributed to this include the focus of operations on the company s optical networking products and the resulting reduction in efforts related to the cs development program and the video conferencing product line 
as a part of these reduced efforts engineering and development costs related to these projects have been eliminated or greatly reduced 
in addition general and administrative expenditures have been reduced  including the closing of offices in new york and california 
as of march  the company has outstanding obligations for funded debt amounting to approximately million and has cash and temporary investments of approximately million 
accordingly  management believes the company has adequate financial resources and liquidity to meet its ongoing obligations and to execute its business plan 
should the demand for the company s products increase significantly  the company could need additional working capital to finance the resulting growth in accounts receivable and inventories 
management believes that the company could obtain such additional working capital through bank credit agreements  other lending agreements  the issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination of these sources 
there can be  however  no assurance that such resources would be available to the company or would be available in sufficient amounts or under terms which the company found acceptable 
contingent liabilities as discussed in item legal proceedings in the company s annual report on form k  the company is exposed to certain contingent liabilities which  if resolved adversely to the company  would adversely affect its liquidity  its results of operations  and or its financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk with regard to financial instruments because a loan from the coastal trust bears interest based on the prime rate 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional pre tax loss of approximately  the estimated additional expense is based upon the increased interest expense of the company s variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  as of march  the company has repaid all variable rate debt  therefore a change in interest rate will not impact interest expense
