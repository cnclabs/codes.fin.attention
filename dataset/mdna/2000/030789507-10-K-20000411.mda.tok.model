item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ames changed its fiscal year from the last saturday in january to the saturday nearest january  effective with the fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal we made this change so that our fiscal year would coincide with the fiscal year of most other publicly held retailers 
our fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal  and fiscal consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year ended january   which we refer to as fiscal  consisted of weeks 
you should read the discussion that follows in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the inventory in the former hills stores was liquidated  and stores were remodeled and opened as ames stores 
this process was completed in september during the liquidation period  professional liquidators operated the former hills stores under an agency agreement with ames 
under the agreement  ames received a minimum guaranteed amount of of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory sold and had the potential to receive a greater return if the sale proceeds exceeded a specified percentage of retail value 
for financial reporting purposes in the charts that follow  hills net sales represent the actual sale proceeds from the merchandise liquidation sales  its cost of merchandise sold represents the cost of merchandise sold as adjusted for the guaranteed return amount  and its selling general and administrative expenses include the portion of those proceeds that were to be paid to the liquidators 
upon completion of the liquidation and remodeling the hills stores were reopened and participated in grand opening promotions 
consequently we incurred higher than normal pre opening and promotion expenses in fiscal because of the liquidation activity  the remodeling activity and the large volume of grand openings with their associated expenses  the consolidated operating results are not representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of business and are not directly comparable to previously published ames results exclusive of hills

the other column for fiscal above represents expenses incurred during the period of remodeling the hills stores ie  pre opening expenses incurred during the conversion or dark period as well as certain other expenses and tax benefits 
the above layaway adj 
column represents the impact of the change in the method of accounting for layaway sales 
we adopted the change in accounting for layaway sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal in consideration of the staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition issued by the staff of the securities and exchange commission in december the liquidation and remodeling activity in the former hills stores distorts any direct comparison of the principal components of ames consolidated results for fiscal and fiscal and prior years 
accordingly  in the discussion that follows  ames net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and its leased department and other income for fiscal and fiscal will be compared excluding the pre conversion hills results and other charges 
the comparison of depreciation and amortization expense as well as interest and debt expense will be on a consolidated basis 
net sales increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal due primarily to the sales contribution of the former hills stores after conversion to the ames format and growth in same store sales 
we experienced strong increases in our ladies sportswear  toys and home entertainment departments 
gross margin increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the former hills stores and an increase in the gross margin rate from to in fiscal the gross margin rate in fiscal benefited from lower markdowns 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the addition of the former hills stores 
selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease resulted from the comparable store sales gain and improved efficiencies of scale due to the hills acquisition 
leased department and other income increased million in fiscal from fiscal a substantial portion of the increase resulted from additional leased sales originating in the former hills stores  as well as an increase in layaway fees  also originating in the former hills stores 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase results from the additional depreciation and amortization of the former hills fixed assets and beneficial lease rights and the amortization of goodwill 
the beneficial lease rights and goodwill related to the hills acquisition are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying lease years on average for the lease rights and years for goodwill 
the amortization of the excess of our revalued net assets over equity under fresh start reporting remained the same in fiscal as in fiscal we are amortizing this amount over a ten year period  which will conclude in january net interest expense increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to interest expense incurred for our senior notes  the hills capital lease and financing obligations and a higher level of borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
during the year  we completed the issuance of our senior notes to support the conversion of the former hills stores 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this document for further discussion of these events 
we recorded a consolidated income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to an million provision in fiscal the fiscal benefit primarily represents the reduction of a valuation allowance of million previously recorded against certain deferred tax assets  which reflects our expectation of using the net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
subsequent to the date of these financial statements  we announced the purchase of the leases to seven goldblatt s stores in the chicago area  marking our entry to this market 
fiscal compared to fiscal on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding voting stock of hills stores company 
accordingly  the operations of hills and its subsidiaries during the month of january are included in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal immediately following our acquisition of hills  we began implementing a series of initiatives to prepare for the conversion of of the hills stores into ames stores and the permanent closure of the four remaining hills stores 
these initiatives included the termination of most of hills corporate and administrative operations and personnel  the announced closure of seven ames stores that we considered to be directly competitive with acquired hills stores or under performing and the engagement of two experienced liquidation firms  gordon brothers retail partners llc and the nassi group llc  to operate the hills stores until their closure and to liquidate hills merchandise inventories 
under our agreement with gordon brothers llc and the nassi group llc  we were entitled to retain from the proceeds of the liquidation sales  as a minimum guaranteed amount  of the initial ticketed retail price of the inventory sold  irrespective of the actual price at which it is sold 
the remaining sale proceeds  net of the expenses of operating the stores  were payable to the liquidators as compensation for their services  subject to additional allocations to ames to the extent that proceeds exceeded specified targets 
for financial reporting purposes  hills net sales during the month of january represent the actual sale proceeds from merchandise liquidation sales  its cost of merchandise sold represents the guaranteed minimum amount that ames is entitled to retain  and its selling  general and administrative expenses include the portion of those proceeds that were paid to the liquidators 
because of the unique nature of our contractual arrangements with gordon brothers llc and the nassi group llc  as well as the fact that the hills stores were in the process of liquidation  hills results for the month of january are not representative of those of a retailer operating in the ordinary course of business and are not directly comparable to ames results exclusive of hills 
the acquisition of hills also resulted in various costs and charges during the month of january that impacted ames consolidated results 
these other costs and charges consisted principally of costs associated with terminating contracts that became obsolete with the acquisition of hills  the write off of deferred financing costs related to a prior credit facility  interest expense for borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition and a one time charge for the announced closing of the seven ames stores 
the following table illustrates the separate contribution of ames full year of operations and hills one month of operations to various components of the consolidated results of operations for fiscal  as well as the impact on the consolidated results of the other costs and charges described above fiscal fiscal ames hills other total in millions total net sales    leased department and other income total revenue    costs and expenses cost of merchandise sold    selling  general  and administrative expense depreciation and amortization expense  net interest and debt expense  net store closing charge income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss the circumstances under which hills operations have been conducted since december  and the accounting treatment accorded those operations as a consequence of the agreement with gordon brothers and the nassi group distort any direct comparison of the principal components of ames consolidated results for fiscal and fiscal accordingly  in the discussion that follows  ames net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and its leased department and other income for fiscal are presented and compared exclusive of the hills results 
the impact of the hills acquisition is included in the comparison of depreciation and amortization expense and interest and debt expense 
ames net sales increased  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal  due primarily to growth in same store sales 
ames experienced particularly strong sales improvements in sales of domestics  toys  ready to assemble furniture  and women s sportswear 
in comparing results for the two fiscal years  you should bear in mind that net sales in fiscal were favorably affected by the inclusion of a full or nearly full year of operations of two stores that were closed in the beginning of fiscal and by the fact that fiscal included one additional week of operations 
ames gross margin increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  but remained unchanged as a percentage of net sales at 
the gross margin rate in fiscal benefited from a higher average markup on sales  which was partially offset by higher markdowns 
ames selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the percentage decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in store related expenses and advertising expense  partially offset by an increase in health and medical costs 
ames leased department and other income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to the leased shoe department  layaway and vending income  as well as the receipt of funds previously held in trust 
ames depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase related primarily to new point of sale systems and store automation equipment acquired under certain capital leases 
the hills acquisition added a further million of depreciation and amortization expense associated with the additional depreciation and amortization of its fixed assets and beneficial lease rights and the amortization of goodwill relating to the excess of the hills acquisition cost over the value of the acquired assets 
we are amortizing the beneficial lease rights using the straight line method over the terms of the related leases which average approximately years and are amortizing the hills goodwill over years on a straight line basis 
the amortization of the excess of our revalued net assets over equity under fresh start reporting remained the same in fiscal as in fiscal we are amortizing this amount over a ten year period that will conclude in january the hills acquisition resulted in a  or million  increase in consolidated interest expense  net of interest income  in fiscal debt and capital lease obligations of hills accounted for million of the increase 
another million of the increase was attributable to the non cash write off of deferred financing costs under ames prior credit facility 
the balance was attributable to borrowings under our bank credit agreement to finance costs of the acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million in connection with the announced closing of seven ames stores that were scheduled to close in fiscal principal components of these charges were lease costs and the write down of fixed assets 
we also planned for the closing of four of the acquired hills stores and  pursuant to the purchase method of accounting  provided for these closings in the valuation of the acquired hills assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges of million in connection with the closing of two stores  of which million was classified as a store closing charge and million was recorded as part of the cost of merchandise sold 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal  of which approximately million was paid in cash 
in fiscal  we recorded an income tax provision of million  of which approximately million was paid in cash 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources ames principal sources of liquidity are its bank credit agreement  cash from operations and cash on hand 
our current bank credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million expiring june  borrowings under the agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and we are required to meet certain financial covenants if our availability under the credit agreement falls below specified levels 
our peak borrowing level in fiscal under the agreement was million 
on april   we completed the sale of million of ames senior notes 
the net proceeds from the sale of the ames senior notes  approximately million  were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility 
the ames senior notes pay interest semi annually in april and october and mature in april on may   we completed the public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  were used to reduce our borrowings under the bank credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
our cash position decreased million during fiscal the decrease was due primarily to million of capital expenditures  inventory investments of million and million in debt and capital lease payments  partially offset by million of borrowings under our bank credit agreement  million from the issuance of the ames senior notes and the net amount of million from the issuance of common stock 
our cash position decreased by million during fiscal this decrease was due primarily to million paid out in the acquisition of hills net of cash acquired  million of capital expenditures and million in debt and capital lease payments partially offset by million in cash from operations and million of borrowings under our bank credit facility 
merchandise inventories increased million in fiscal due to the addition of twelve new stores  in addition to fully stocking the former hills stores and recording the inventory in the converted hills stores at cost in fiscal as compared to liquidation value in fiscal in fiscal  the hills inventories were valued at approximately of the ticketed retail price of the merchandise  representing the minimum amount we were entitled to retain out of the proceeds from the liquidation of the merchandise 
merchandise inventories increased by million in fiscal due to planned increases and the inclusion of million of hills merchandise inventories 
net fixed assets increased by million during fiscal due to million in capital expenditures  primarily relating to remodeling the former hills stores million  and opening twelve other stores 
these additions were partially offset by the additional writedown of million in fixed assets acquired from hills and depreciation expense of million recorded during fiscal net fixed assets increased by million during fiscal due to the inclusion of million in net fixed assets of hills and million of capital expenditures  including million in new point of sale equipment under capital leases 
the hills net fixed assets were adjusted to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date 
beneficial lease rights represent the excess of the fair market value of the acquired hills leases over contract value of those leases 
we are amortizing this amount over the terms of the related leases using the straight line method 
goodwill decreased million as a result of the final determination of the fair market value of the assets and liabilities acquired with the hills stores and a full year of amortization expense  which approximated million 
the primary changes were the reduction of million deferred tax asset valuation allowance see note to the consolidated financial statements  a reduction in accrued liabilities and reserves of million as these liabilities were no longer deemed to be required and the increase of million to inventory values 
when the hills inventory was liquidated  proceeds generated were greater than anticipated 
these changes were partially offset by an additional million write down of fixed assets primarily fixtures acquired from hills to recognize their deemed fair value 
goodwill is being amortized over years using the straight line method 
accounts payable increased million due to an increase in merchandise receipts in january over january accounts payable increased million during fiscal due to improved payment terms  and the inclusion of hills accounts payable of million as of january  long term debt as of january  consisted of borrowings under our bank credit agreement of million  million of hills senior notes and million of ames senior notes 
subsequent to fiscal year end we announced that we had amended our million credit facility 
the amended agreement provides ames with a reduction in the interest rate charged and enhanced flexibility as to the usage of the funds available under the credit facility 
capital lease and financing obligations decreased by million during fiscal as payments on capital lease obligations exceeded new capital leases 
we have not paid any cash dividends during the past four fiscal years 
the payment of cash dividends is restricted under the terms of our bank credit agreement 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal were million and included  among other items  the opening of twelve new stores  the remodeling of the former hills stores and the upgrading of selected management information systems  including the completion of our chain wide installation of new point of sale information equipment and related software in our stores 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million and included the opening of six new stores  the remodeling of twenty two stores  and the upgrading of certain management information systems 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million for fiscal these capital expenditures will be comprised of remodeling and conversion of the former goldblatt s stores  new stores  and maintenance of our existing stores 
we expect to finance these expenditures through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
land  buildings and improvements are financed principally through long term leases 
seasonality our business is seasonal in nature  with a large portion of our net sales occurring in the second half of our fiscal year as a result of the back to school and christmas shopping seasons 
net sales are highest in the last fiscal quarter of our annual net sales in fiscal 
the demand for working capital is heaviest in may  and from august through november  when sufficient merchandise must be purchased for the spring  back to school and christmas seasons  respectively 
legal we are party to various claims and legal proceedings on a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
ames intends to defend these issues vigorously and believes that the final outcome of the various proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations see item legal proceedings 
impact of year ames completed its remediation and testing of systems for year vulnerabilities in late no disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems were experienced during the changeover and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
ames expensed approximately million during in connection with its year remediation efforts 
our total cost for our year effort was approximately million 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products and internal systems  or with the products and services of third parties
