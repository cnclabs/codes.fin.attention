general the company s net income is primarily affected by its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities  and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  including fhlb advances 
the company s net income also is affected by its provisions for losses on loans and investments in real estate  as well as the amount of noninterest income including fees and service charges and gains or losses on sales of loans  and noninterest expense  including salaries and employee benefits  premises and equipment expense  data processing expense  federal deposit insurance premiums and income taxes 
net income of the company also is affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
market risk analysis general 
it is the objective of the company to minimize  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate spread is the difference between the company s yield on its interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is generally understood to be the sensitivity of the company s earnings  net asset values  and stockholders equity to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the company s earnings 
the effect on earnings of changes in interest rates generally depends on how quickly the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities react to the changes in market rates of interest 
if the company s cost of deposit accounts reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the yield on the company s mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings 
on the other hand  if the company s yield on its mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the company s cost of deposit accounts  then an increasing rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings 
net portfolio value 
the value of the company s loan and investment portfolio will change as interest rates change 
rising interest rates will generally decrease the company s net portfolio value npv  while falling interest rates will generally increase the value of that portfolio 
the following table set forth  quantitatively  as of september   the ots estimate of the projected changes in npv in the event of a   and basis point instantaneous and permanent increase and decrease in market interest rates change in change in npv interest rates as a percentage of in basis points net portfolio value estimated market rate shock amount change change ratio value of assets dollars in thousands computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are calculated by the ots from data provided by the company and are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit runoffs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their effect on the company s npv in the future 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent the company s primary loan product  have features that restrict changes in interest rates during the initial term and over the remaining life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the company s portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market rates decrease 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of changes in financial condition general 
the company s total assets decreased million  or  from million at september  to million at september  total assets increased million  or  from million at september  to million at september  loans receivable  net 
the company s net loans receivable increased million  or  and million  or  in fiscal years and  respectively from the prior years 
the increases in both periods were due to modest loan demand within the company s market area and purchases of loans from outside the bank s primary market area 
during and  the bank purchased million and million of loans 
management expects that it will be necessary to supplement local demand with purchases of loans from outside the bank s primary market area 
demand for single family residential loans has been particularly weak over the past months 
investment securities 
the investment securities portfolio decreased million or from at september   to million at september  in accordance with the company s present strategy  the principal paydowns and maturities of investments were used to fund loan growth

during the year ended september   the company purchased life insurance on the lives of executive officers and members of the board of directors 
such life insurance had cash surrender value of million and million at september  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to earnings on the cash surrender value  net of premiums 
deposits 
historically  deposits have provided the company with a stable source of relatively low cost funding 
the market for deposits is competitive  which has caused the company to utilize primarily certificate accounts that are more responsive to market interest rates rather than passbook accounts 
the company offers a traditional line of deposit products that currently includes checking  interest bearing checking  savings  certificates of deposit  commercial checking and money market accounts 
the million  or  increase in deposits during the year ended september   was primarily due to core deposit growth in the bank s market areas 
fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements 
the company also relies upon fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements as a source to fund assets 
approximately and of the company s assets were funded with fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements as of september  and  respectively 
at september   fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million at september   an increase of million  or from  reflecting  in part  the increased deposits resulting from the company s acquisition of branches during and the proceeds from company s second step stock offering

discussion of results of operations overview 
net income was million for fiscal  compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s average interest earning assets have increased over the three year period ended september   which has resulted in higher levels of interest income 
the company s net interest rate spread decreased to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september   and for the year ended september  the decrease in net interest rate spread during was primarily due to an increased cost of funds 
the weighted average cost of funds increased basis points for the year ended september  to from for the year ended september  the bank s weighted average cost of funds is directly related to market conditions and competition for funds 
the increase in the net interest rate spread for fiscal was a result of an increase in higher yielding average loans outstanding  a decrease in relatively lower yielding average investments outstanding  a decrease in the average cost of borrowed funds and a decrease in borrowed funds 
the company s strategy has been to utilize principal repayments from investment securities to fund loan growth within the company s local market 
net interest income 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest rate spread is impacted by changes in general market interest rates  including changes in the relation between short and long term interest rates the yield curve  and the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
while management seeks to manage its business to limit the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates  different aspects of its business nevertheless remain subject to risk from interest rate changes 
net interest income was million for fiscal compared to million and million  for fiscal and  respectively 
the tables below analyze net interest income by component and in terms of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes in the related yields and rates 
the company s interest earning assets are primarily comprised of single family mortgage loans and investment securities  which are primarily mortgage backed securities 
interest bearing liabilities primarily include deposits and fhlb advances 
the increases in average interest earning assets during fiscal   and can be attributed to increases in the loan portfolio  funded primarily with deposits and fhlb advances and increases in capital 
fiscal also benefited from the proceeds of the sale of stock which provided approximately million to purchase investment securities or repay borrowings 
see discussion of changes in financial condition for a discussion of the company s asset portfolio and capital resources and liquidity for discussion of borrowings 
the majority of the company s interest earning assets are comprised of adjustable rate assets 
the company s adjustable rate loans and investment securities are subject to periodic interest rate caps 
periodic caps limit the amount by which the interest rate on a particular mortgage loan may increase at its next interest rate reset date 
in a rising rate environment  the interest rate spread could be negatively impacted when the repricing of interest earning assets is delayed or prohibited  compared to market interest rate movements  as a result of periodic interest rate caps

during fiscal  the bank purchased million in loans from outside its market area 
management anticipates that loan demand will remain weak for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  loan demand was relatively strong  resulting in an increase in mortgage loans outstanding  an increase in the net interest rate spread and an increase of million  or  in net interest income 
the average yield on interest earning assets increased to in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to from and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets was largely due to an increase in average loans receivable  net and a decrease in average investments receivable 
the increase in average cost of interest bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in market rates 
provision for loan losses 
the bank provided for loan losses of   and  respectively  in the fiscal years ended september    and management considered several factors in determining the necessary level of its allowance for loan losses and as a result of the process  the necessary provision for loan losses including but not limited to historical loan losses and current delinquency rates 
noninterest income 
non interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   and million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase in and was primarily due to an increase in fee income due to an increase in demand deposit accounts and the change in gain or loss on trading securities 
noninterest expense 
non interest expense consisting primarily of salaries and employee benefits  premises and equipment  data processing and federal deposit insurance premiums totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the payment of a severance agreement to a former executive officer in fiscal income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended september   was million compared to million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to an increase in income before tax 
income tax expense for the year ended september   was million compared to million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income before tax  a decrease in tax exempt income and a change in an estimate in the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources the bank is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which varies from time to time depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank adjusts liquidity as appropriate to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
at september   the bank was in compliance with such liquidity requirements 
the bank s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities  fhlb advances  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans  and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and mortgage backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance 
for additional information about cash flows from the bank s operating  financing  and investing activities  see consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the bank and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the bank s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
fdic insurance premiums and assessment in september  congress enacted legislation to recapitalize the saif by a one time assessment on all saif insured deposits held as of march  the assessment was basis points per in deposits  payable on november  for the bank  the assessment amounted to  or  after consideration of tax benefits  based on the bank s saif insured deposits of million
