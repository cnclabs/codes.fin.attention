this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit overview we are engaged in the development of biopharmaceutical products for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders  inflammation and cancer 
since our inception in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  product and clinical development 
since mid  we have focused our resources increasingly to clinical manufacturing and clinical development 
we are currently examining our two lead genetically altered antibody product candidates in eight different clinical development programs 
one of our lead genetically altered antibody product candidates  g sc  which is in development in collaboration with procter gamble  has completed enrolling in an approximately patient phase iib study for the treatment of inflammation caused by cardiopulmonary bypass surgery 
two additional phase ii studies are in progress in myocardial infarction patients  in the one study in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy  and in the other in patients receiving angioplasty 
our other lead genetically altered antibody product candidate g is in clinical development for the treatment of a variety of chronic autoimmune diseases 
as of august  enrollment has been completed in a phase ii clinical study in rheumatoid arthritis patients and a phase ii study in membranous nephritis patients is ongoing 
in both of these indications  enrollment has commenced in an additional month open label extension study to test safety 
in addition  we have commenced three separate phase ib pilot trials to study g in patients with psoriasis  dermatomyositis  and bullous pemphigoid 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and manufacturing  and developing a sales and marketing force 
in september  we acquired prolifaron  inc a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in san diego  california 
prolifaron was developing therapeutic antibodies addressing multiple diseases  including cancer 
the acquisition was in the form of a merger between our new wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  and prolifaron 
in the merger  we are obligated to issue up to  shares of our common stock  with a value of approximately million  to the stockholders of prolifaron 
the acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
results of operations fiscal years ended july   and we earned contract research revenues of million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to the increased contract revenues from our collaborative research and development agreement with procter gamble 
the increase in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily due to a non refundable up front license fee of million which we received from procter gamble in february in connection with our entering into the collaboration agreement with procter gamble to develop and commercialize g sc 
additionally  during fiscal year ended july   we received million in contract revenues from procter gamble under our collaborative research and development agreement 
during the fiscal year ended july   we incurred expenses of million on research and development activities 
in the fiscal year ended july   we incurred expenses of million  and in the fiscal year ended july  we incurred expenses of million in research and development activities 
the increase in research and development expenses in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of the clinical trials of our lead c inhibitor product candidates and the cost of manufacturing development and manufacturing of our c inhibitors for our clinical trials 
in the fiscal year ended july  the increase as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily attributable to an expansion of the clinical trials of our lead c inhibitor product candidates and process manufacturing development for our c inhibitor product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses were million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to fiscal year ended july  was principally due to higher payroll related costs  as well as higher facilities expenses related to increased rent expense and space and professional fees related to public relations and patent legal costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended july  as compared to the fiscal year ended july  was primarily related to higher recruiting expenses  legal expenses related to business development and patent costs in the fiscal year ended july  other income  net  was million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  the increase in the fiscal year ended july  was due to increased interest income from higher cash balances resulting from the net proceeds obtained from the issuance of subordinated convertible notes and follow on public offering of our common stock during fiscal the decrease in other income  net  for the fiscal year ended july  was due to lower cash balances available for investment as compared to amounts available in fiscal year ended july  as a result of the above factors  we incurred net losses of million for the fiscal year ended july   million for the fiscal year ended july   and million for the fiscal year ended july  liquidity and capital resources since our inception in january  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures principally through private placements of our common and preferred stock  an initial public offering of our common stock and a subsequent follow on offering  convertible subordinated notes  other debt financing  payments under corporate collaborations and grants  and equipment and leasehold improvements financing 
in march  we completed a million private placement of our convertible subordinated notes due march  the notes bear interest semi annually on september and march of each year  beginning september  the holders may convert all or a portion of the notes into common stock at any time on or before march  at a conversion price of per share 
we incurred issuance costs related to this offering of approximately million which are being amortized into interest expense over the seven year term of the notes 
in may  pursuant to a registration rights agreement  we filed a registration statement under the securities act of with the sec to register resales of the notes and the shares of common stock into which the notes are convertible 
in november  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a follow on public offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million to the company 
in february  we acquired the manufacturing assets  principally land  buildings and laboratory equipment  for the xenotransplantation program developed by us surgical 
we financed the purchase of the manufacturing assets through a million term note payable to us surgical 
interest is per annum and is payable quarterly 
the principal balance under the note is due in may security for this term note is the manufacturing assets that we purchased 
in the fiscal year ended july   we financed the purchase of laboratory and process development equipment and leasehold improvements through a million secured term loan from a commercial bank 
principal payments of  are payable quarterly through august as of july   the outstanding balance on this term loan was  principal is due with interest at a variable rate which is reset quarterly 
as of july   the annualized interest rate was 
the term loan agreement requires us to maintain a restricted cash balance equal to the outstanding loan balance divided by plus accrued interest in an interest earning money market account as collateral for the note 
as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million 
at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million of cash we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
this increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due to the increase in available cash from our sale convertible subordinated notes and the follow on public offering of our common stock in november as of july   we have invested million in property and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase significantly for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we lease our administrative and research and development facilities under an operating lease at science park  new haven  connecticut consisting of approximately  square feet at a fixed monthly rate of approximately  we expect to relocate our administrative and research and development facilities at the end of calendar year our pilot manufacturing plant  encompassing approximately  square feet of labs and office space  is currently being utilized for producing compounds for our current clinical trials and will remain currently in new haven  connecticut at our current facilities 
in addition through a wholly owned subsidiary  we own a transgenic manufacturing facility located in the northeast 
we believe the laboratory space will be adequate for our current research and development activities 
in may we entered into a new lease for our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut 
the lease commenced in august and has a term of ten years and six months 
occupancy of this lease is contingent upon the timely departure of the current tenant and subsequent additional work to be completed by the landlord 
at this site we will lease and occupy a total of  square feet of space 
we expect to incur initial leasehold improvements and relocation costs aggregating approximately million  of which  were incurred as of july  at our option  the landlord is required to fund up to million of these lease improvements under a financing arrangement payable over the term of the lease at per annum 
in addition  we will be required to pay a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
monthly fixed rent starts at approximately  increasing to approximately  over the term of the lease 
we have issued a  open letter of credit to secure the lease 
in september  we acquired prolifaron  inc a privately held biopharmaceutical company located in san diego  california through a merger between our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc and prolifaron 
alexion antibody technologies  inc leases approximately  square feet of labs and office space at a monthly fixed rent that starts at approximately  increasing to approximately  over the term of the lease and terminates in august procter gamble has agreed to fund all clinical testing of our c inhibitor  g sc  initially for use in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery  myocardial infarction and angioplasty 
the procter gamble collaboration does not involve any of our other product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing available capital resources with the proceeds of our sale of million of convertible subordinated notes  together with the anticipated funding from the collaboration agreement with procter and gamble  will provide us adequate funding for the clinical testing of our c inhibitor product  g sc in cardiopulmonary bypass and acute coronary syndromes 
in addition  our interest earned on available cash and marketable securities should be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next months 
while we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures other than the leasehold improvements at the cheshire facility  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including progress of our research and development programs  progress and results of clinical trials  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents and any necessary licenses  our ability to establish marketing and sales capabilities  our ability to establish development and commercialization relationships  and costs of manufacturing and manufacturing scale up 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  for research  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  manufacturing process development  additional capital expenditures related to personnel  and facilities expansion  clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements  and marketing and sales 
in addition to funds we may receive from our collaboration with procter gamble  we will need to raise or generate substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in addition  if and when we achieve contractual milestones related to product development and product license applications and approvals  additional payments would be required if we elect to continue and maintain our licenses with our licensors  aggregating up to a maximum of million 
our additional financing may include public or private debt or equity offerings  equity line facilities  bank loans and or collaborative research and development arrangements with corporate partners 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available on terms acceptable by us  if at all  or that discussions with potential strategic or collaborative partners will results in any agreements on a timely basis  if at all 
the unavailability of additional financing could require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and product development programs or to license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourself  any of which could have a material adverse effect 
for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire through and million of tax credit carryforwards which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we cannot assure you that our ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in future years will not be limited as a result of a change in ownership 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company s marketable securities are held for purposes other than trading and we believe that we currently have no material adverse market risk exposure 
the marketable securities as of july   had maturities of less than two years 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at july  and was and  respectively 
the fair value of marketable securities held at july  was million 
at july   we had aggregate fixed rate debt of approximately million 
if interest rates associated with this debt were increased  a corresponding increase in our annual interest expense of approximately  would occur
