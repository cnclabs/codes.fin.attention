we typically sell our advertisements and deliver our email related services under purchase order agreements with advertisers which are short term in nature or subject to cancellation 
the pricing of ads and email messages is based on a variety of factors  including the gross dollar amount spent on the advertising campaign and the platform over which the campaign is delivered 
we strive to sell of our inventory through the combination of advertisements sold on a cpm basis  which is the cost to the advertiser to run  ads  and a cost per action basis whereby revenues are generated if the user responds to the ad with an action  such as an inquiry or a purchase of the product advertised 
we recognize advertising and email revenues in the period that the advertisement or promotion is delivered  provided that no significant obligations remain 
in nearly all cases  we recognize revenues generated from advertising sales  net of any commissions paid to advertising agencies on behalf of their clients 
we pay our affiliated web site clients a fee calculated as a percentage of revenues generated by advertisements run on the web site  which amount is included in cost of revenues 
we pay our email list owners a royalty for use of their email list in our ad campaigns 
in addition  we are generally responsible for billing and collecting for advertisements delivered to our networks 
the period to period comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects should be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in the rapidly evolving internet market 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent periods  we anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to a high level of planned operating and capital expenditures 
in particular  we expect to increase our operating expenses in order to expand our sales and marketing organization and to further enhance  develop  integrate and scale our connect and e 
merge technologies 
page results of operations compared to total revenues increased in from due to the explosive growth of the internet as a business medium and our rapidly growing position within this medium on a global basis 
in addition to expanding our services geographically from the us to canada  europe and latin america in  we also extended our product line beyond the web site network business to offer opt in email services and technology solutions 
revenues network revenues 
our network revenues increased to million in from million in  representing growth 
this increase was fueled by a dramatic expansion in the number of ad impressions sold in the us network business  a significantly increasing number of web sites that we represent  and our expansion globally to canada  europe and latin america 
in addition  the number of advertisers and the amount of advertising spending on the internet increased significantly during this period 
email revenues 
our email revenues increased to million in from million in  representing growth 
this increase was fueled by a significant expansion in the types of email services that we offer to include email list management and list brokerage services in addition to our service bureau offerings  as well as a dramatic increase in the number of opt in email addresses under management 
the expansion into these new service offerings was supported by our acquisition of consumernet in the third quarter of we believe that strong industry acceptance of opt in email advertising has promoted this strong historical growth and will continue to increase our revenue in the future 
cost of revenues and gross profit network cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of network revenues consists primarily of fees paid to affiliated web sites  which are calculated as a percentage of revenues resulting from ads delivered on our networks 
cost of revenues also includes third party ad serving costs  depreciation of our ad serving system and internet access 
gross profit dollars increased significantly and the gross margin  which is network gross profit as a percent of total network revenues  increased to approximately in from in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to more favorable third party ad serving costs due to renegotiated rates 
email cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of email revenues consists primarily of list provider royalties and delivery costs 
gross profit dollars increased significantly due to the growth in revenues 
gross margin decreased from to as the mix of business shifted from service bureau in to primarily list management and list brokerage in  each of which has a lower gross margin 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales force salaries and commissions  advertising expenditures and costs of trade shows  conventions and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses increased in dollar terms  however  as a percentage of revenue the expenses decreased from in to in sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of the growth of our business on a global scale and the resulting additions to sales staff as well as increased marketing expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar terms as we continue to invest in sales and marketing personnel  expand into new markets and broaden our visibility  however  we expect that sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will decline as our business matures across multiple product lines and geographic regions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facilities expenses and other overhead expenses incurred to support the growth of our business 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms  however  as a percentage of revenue the expenses decreased from in to in general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the growth of our business  the addition of new personnel and increased operating expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to the additional personnel and other expenses required to support our anticipated business growth  however  we expect that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will decline as our business matures across multiple product lines and geographical regions 
page product development expenses 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs incurred to further develop our ad serving and other technology capabilities 
product development expenses decreased in compared to as connect  our ad serving solution  reached the application development stage in march and we began capitalizing costs related to the project 
we expect to continue to capitalize certain costs through early when connect will become fully operational 
we continue to believe that investment in product development  particularly for our broad range of technology platforms and initiatives  is critical to our strategy of providing excellent service  and we expect to increase the future amounts spent on product development 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  we incurred total amortization charges of million compared to million in the expense is the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquisitions of interad holdings ltd  clickthrough interactive  consumernet and netbooking oy in and petry  advercomm  intelligent interactions  cardsecure and cliqnow in interest expense income  net 
interest income  net was million in and million in the increase in interest income was attributable to interest earned on the cash and cash equivalents from the net proceeds due to our secondary offering of common stock in may minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest relates to losses attributable to minority investors in media europe nv we acquired media europe nv in  and at december  we owned approximately of the primary common equity 
results of operations compared to for the fiscal year ended december   our historical results of operations reflect the acquisitions of petry  advercomm  cliqnow  intelligent interactions and cardsecure from their respective dates of acquisition 
interactive imaginations  our then parent  was merged into us on april  in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
as a result  our historical results of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and represent the results of interactive imaginations and do not reflect any of the operating results of petry  advercomm  cliqnow  intelligent interactions or cardsecure 
during  the historical results of operations of interactive imaginations  the stability and morale of its workforce and overall value of the common stock were negatively impacted by certain significant factors 
such events included a class action lawsuit in the second and third quarters of  which resulted in extraordinary expenses of  in legal costs  unfavorable publicity to interactive imaginations  a significant diversion of management resources  and difficulty in obtaining financing to continue its operations 
we do not believe that the historical revenues or expenses for the years and as discussed below are reliable or accurate indicators of the future performance of the combined company 
revenues 
total revenues were million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was caused primarily by the inclusion of the acquired companies activities and a significant increase in advertising revenue  offset by a decline in revenues caused by the cessation of a license agreement with segasoft in we do not expect to realize meaningful revenues from the segasoft agreement in the future 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily related to increased payments to our affiliated web sites which were caused by growth in advertising revenue and the temporary increase in rates in connection with our transition to a single ad serving technology 
this increase was offset by reduced contentzone ad serving costs 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase from to was caused by higher sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses resulting from the acquisitions we completed in  additional operating expenses incurred in anticipation of future growth  particularly in the number of employees  offices  and other page operating expenses to support expanded us operations  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions we completed in  and acquired in process technology of approximately million from the acquisition of intelligent interactions which was immediately charged to operations in april the value of the acquired in process technology was determined using a combination of a risk adjusted income approach and an independent valuation 
the acquired in process technology had not reached the stage of technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and had no alternative future use 
quarterly results of operations unaudited our results of operations were significantly affected by the rapid growth of our existing business as well as expansion both geographically and into new product lines  including through acquisition 
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for we believe that all necessary adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below

our revenues increased each quarter primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue on the network 
this increase is due to the same reasons noted in the year to year comparison  that is  a dramatic expansion in the number of ad impressions sold in the us network business  a significantly increasing number of web sites that we represent  and our expansion globally through acquisition to canada  europe and latin america 
in addition to network revenues  we generated increased revenues through email services 
we expect email to generate a larger percentage of our revenue in the future 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues increased each quarter due to the growth of our business 
gross margin increased each quarter  reaching approximately in the fourth quarter 
the increase is due to favorable ad serving costs in the network business  as well as an increasing percentage of total revenues being generated by email  which enjoys a higher gross margin than the network business 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of the growth of our business and the resulting additions to sales staff as well as increased marketing expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to invest in sales and marketing personnel  expand into new markets and broaden our visibility 
page general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the growth of our business  the addition of new personnel and increased operating expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to the additional personnel and other expenses required to support our anticipated business growth 
product development expenses 
product development expenses decreased from the first quarter to the second quarter due to capitalizing development costs for connect 
product development expenses remained consistent for the second through the fourth quarters as we continued to develop connect 
we continue to believe that investment in product development  particularly for our broad range of technology platforms and initiatives  is critical to our strategy of providing excellent service  and we expect to increase the future amounts spent on product development 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relates to acquisitions 
the expense increased during the third and fourth quarters principally due to the acquisition of consumernet in august of interest income 
interest income is attributable to interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income increased in the second and third quarters as cash and cash equivalents were increased 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest relates to losses attributable to minority investors in media europe nv we acquired media europe nv in  and at december  we owned approximately 
liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million versus million at december  cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid short term investments with maturities of three months or less 
the value of investments totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these investments generally relate to equity and cash transfers from us for minority equity ownership positions 
such investments include  but are not limited to  chinadotcom  shopnow 
com  naviant  inc and idealab 
we used approximately million and million in cash to fund these investments in and  respectively 
in addition  the company acquired majority and full ownership positions in several companies through the transfer of common stock and cash 
these acquisitions included  but were not limited to interad holdings  ltd  netbooking  clickthrough interactive and consumernet during cash used for such acquisitions approximated million during and million during we generated much of our liquidity through our initial public offering that occurred in and our secondary offering which occurred in the initial public offering and the secondary offering provided us with approximately million and million  respectively  and was used to finance growth in operations  acquisitions of subsidiaries and investments discussed above  and the purchase of property and equipment needed during this growth period 
we used approximately million and million of cash in operating activities during and generally as a result of our net operating losses  adjusted for certain non cash items such as amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and non cash related equity transactions  and also by significant increases in accounts receivable that were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used by us for investing activities was approximately million and million during and  respectively 
in addition to the acquisitions and investments discussed above  we have continued to develop our infrastructure through capital expenditures  including capitalized software 
cash used for such expenditures totaled approximately million and million for and  respectively 
to the extent we continue to acquire additional ad serving hardware  make cash investments in other businesses or acquire other businesses  net cash used in investing activities could increase 
currently  we have various capital and operating leases relating to the use of computer hardware  software and office space 
page the annual lease for our corporate headquarters is approximately million per year 
we expect to expand our corporate headquarters space 
we believe that the expenses associated with the additional space will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
total rent expense for relating to all leases was million 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded because we incurred net operating losses for all periods presented 
at december   we had approximately million of us and million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  such carryforwards expire in various years through as a result of various equity transactions during  and  we believe that our company has undergone an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  the utilization of million of the net operating loss carryforward is limited 
due to this limitation  and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of this portion of the net operating loss carryforward  we have not recorded any tax benefit for these or the foreign net operating losses  and a valuation allowance has been recorded for these portions of the net deferred tax assets 
in connection with the unrealized gain on the chinadotcom  and shopnow 
com investments reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity deficit pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 it is considered more likely than not that million of the net operating loss carryforward at december  will be realized 
as a result  the portion of the valuation allowance relating to the net deferred tax asset associated with this amount has been released  with the effects netted against the sfas gain 
similarly  a deferred tax asset was recognized for a million net operating loss incurred in  with the benefit netted against the sfas gain 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to fund our requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities  we may need to sell a portion of our current investments in affiliates  or we may sell additional equity or debt securities which would result in further dilution of our stockholders 
we expect to invest additional amounts of working capital in our purchased subsidiaries and majority owned businesses in to support their future operations 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to fund our requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
to the extent that we encounter unanticipated opportunities  we may need to raise additional funds sooner  in which case we may sell additional equity  issue debt securities or convertible debt securities or borrow funds from banks or other financial sources 
sales of additional equity or issuances of additional debt securities may result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sell additional equity or issue debt securities in the future or that additional financing will be available to us when needed on commercially reasonably terms  or at all 
year compliance to date our systems and software have not experienced any material disruption due to the onset of the year  and we have completed our year preparedness activities 
however  we cannot assure that we will not experience disruptions in the future as a consequence of year issues 
we cannot quantify the amount of our potential exposure  but do not believe it to be material 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity which delayed the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after june  sfas established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
we have not yet determined the impact of this pronouncement on our financial position or results of operations 
page forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  and section e of the securities exchange act of we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those set forth under item risk factors 
words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors before you decide to buy our common stock 
these risks may adversely impair our business operations 
we have a limited operating history on which an investor can evaluate our business 
we were formed as a result of three companies in february none of the companies nor any company that we have since acquired had an operating history of more than four years prior to acquisition or merger 
we  therefore  have an extremely limited operating history 
you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by companies with limited operating histories  particularly companies in new and rapidly expanding markets such as internet advertising 
these risks include our ability to o develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our web sites  advertisers  and other third parties  o further develop and upgrade our technology  o respond to competitive developments  o implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  and o attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
we may be unable to successfully integrate the companies that we have acquired 
we were formed in february to consolidate three internet advertising companies and have since acquired or agreed to acquire eleven more companies 
in combining these entities  we have faced risks and continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls  ad serving technology  reporting systems and procedures  and expanding  training and managing our work force 
this process of integration may take a significant period of time and will require the dedication of management and other resources  which may distract management s attention from our other operations 
we intend to continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including o the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  o the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions  and page o the potential loss of key employees of any acquired business 
our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company could adversely affect our business 
we anticipate continued losses and we may never be profitable 
we incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
each of our predecessors had net losses in every year of their operation 
we anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to a high level of planned operating and capital expenditures 
although our revenue has grown rapidly in recent periods  such growth may not continue and may not lead to profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o the addition of new or loss of existing clients  o changes in fees paid by advertisers and direct marketers  o changes in service fees payable by us to owners of web sites or email lists  or ad serving fees payable by us to third parties  o the introduction of new internet marketing services by us or our competitors  o variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations  including personnel costs  and o general economic conditions 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors 
in addition  our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues  as we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we believe that our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year and direct marketers mail substantially more marketing materials in the third quarter each year 
expenditures by advertisers and direct marketers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
our revenue could be materially reduced by a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers  direct marketers or the economy in general  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle 
our business may not grow if the internet advertising market does not continue to develop 
the internet as a marketing medium has not been in existence for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate its effectiveness 
our business would be adversely affected if the internet advertising market fails to continue to develop 
there are currently no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet marketing other than clickthrough rates  which generally have been declining 
we cannot be certain that such standards will develop to sufficiently support internet marketing as a significant advertising medium 
actual or perceived ineffectiveness of online marketing in general  or inaccurate measurements or database information in particular  could limit the long term growth of online advertising and cause our revenue levels to decline 
banner advertising  from which we currently derive most of our revenues  may not be an effective advertising method in the future 
page the majority of our revenues are derived from the delivery of banner advertisements 
if advertisers determine that banner advertising is an ineffective or unattractive advertising medium  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively make the transition to any other form of internet advertising 
also  there are filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
the commercial viability of internet advertising  and our business  results of operations and financial condition  would be materially and adversely affected by web users widespread adoption of such software 
growth of our business depends on the development of online direct marketing 
adoption of online direct marketing  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional means of direct marketing  such as telemarketing and direct mail  is an important part of our business model 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services to generate demand for our direct marketing services 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit  or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct market apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of our clients 
our development of a next generation ad serving technology may not be successful and may cause business disruption 
connect is our proprietary next generation ad serving technology that is intended to serve as our sole ad serving solution 
we recently launched connect  and to successfully complete the roll out of connect  we must  among other things  ensure that this technology will function efficiently at high volumes  interact properly with our profilz database  offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions 
this development effort could fail technologically or could take more time than expected 
even if we successfully address all these challenges  we must then work with our web sites  advertisers and direct marketing clients to transition them to our new system  which would also create a risk of business disruption and loss of any of our clients 
loss or failure of our third party ad serving technology could disrupt our business 
unless and until the complete roll out and transition to connect is complete  we will be partially dependent on adforce  inc to deliver ads to our networks and web sites 
if such service becomes unavailable or fails to serve our ads properly or fails to produce the frequent operational reports required  our business would be adversely affected 
additionally  our use of multiple systems to serve ads requires us to employ significant effort to prepare information for billing  client statements and financial reporting 
we are upgrading our systems to integrate a new accounting system with our ad serving technologies to improve our accounting  control and reporting methods 
our inability to upgrade our existing reporting systems and streamline our procedures may cause delays in the timely reporting of financial information 
loss of our major web sites would significantly reduce our revenues 
the network generates substantially all of our revenues and it consists of a limited number of our web sites that have contracted for our services under agreements cancelable generally upon a short notice period 
for the twelve month periods ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from advertisements on our top ten web sites 
for the twelve month period ended december   the top ten web sites included at t worldnet service  mapquest 
com  havas interactive  netscape communications  earthlink network  goto 
com  small world sports  alladvantage 
com  multi player games network and world gaming corp 
we experience turnover from time to time among our web sites  and we cannot be certain that the web sites named above remain or will remain associated with us 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of the web sites that account for a significant portion of our revenue from the network 
loss of our advertisers or ad agencies would reduce our revenues 
we generate our revenues from a limited number of advertisers and ad agencies that purchase space on our web sites 
we expect that a limited number of these entities may continue to account for a significant percentage of our page revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the twelve month period ended december   our top ten advertisers and ad agencies accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
advertisers and ad agencies typically purchase advertising under purchase order agreements that run for a limited time 
typically  we enter into short term contracts with advertisers and ad agencies 
since these contracts are short term  we will have to negotiate new contracts or renewals in the future that may have terms that are not as favorable to us as the terms of existing contracts 
we cannot be certain that current advertisers and ad agencies will continue to purchase advertising from us or that we will be able to attract additional advertisers and ad agencies successfully  or that agencies and advertisers will make timely payment of amounts due to us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
the markets for internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase 
our failure to successfully compete may hinder our growth 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including o the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors  o changing demands regarding customer service and support  o shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors  and o the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of our services and products 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully compete against current or future competitors 
in addition  the internet must compete for a share of advertisers total budgets with traditional advertising media  such as television  radio  cable and print  as well as content aggregation companies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising 
to the extent that the internet is perceived to be a limited or ineffective advertising or direct marketing medium  advertisers and direct marketers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet marketing  which could limit the growth of internet marketing 
we may be unable to continue to successfully manage rapid growth 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations both domestically and internationally  in both sales and marketing as well as technological development 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting procedures and systems 
we have experienced rapid growth and expansion in operations that have placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we expect the number of employees to increase in the future 
to successfully compete in the evolving internet industry  we must o continue to improve our financial and management controls  o enhance our reporting systems and procedures  o continue to scale our ad serving systems and upgrade their functional capabilities  and expand  train and manage our work force  and o expand  train  retain and manage our work force 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our expanding operations  or that management will be able to respond effectively to such growth 
our future results of operations also depend on the expansion of our sales  marketing and customer support departments 
our international expansion may pose legal and cultural challenges 
we have operations in a number of international markets  including canada  europe  asia  australia and latin america 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing page efforts 
to date  we have limited experience in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
international operations are subject to other risks  including o changes in regulatory requirements  o reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o general import export restrictions relating to encryption technology and or privacy  o difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  o political and economic instability  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and o seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world 
in addition to these factors  due to our minority stake in the network in asia  we are relying on chinadotcom corporation to conduct operations  build the network  aggregate web publishers and coordinate sales and marketing efforts 
the success of the network in asia is directly dependent on the success of chinadotcom corporation and its dedication of sufficient resources to our relationship 
if we lose our ceo or other senior managers we may not be able to grow 
our success depends upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel  particularly david j 
moore  chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could materially adversely affect our ability to develop our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel in the internet industry is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our key personnel or that we can attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  especially in sales and marketing positions 
although we have not experienced any material impact from the difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified employees  we may be materially impacted in the future from such hiring difficulties 
dependence on proprietary rights and risk of infringement 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have received two patents in the united states  and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the united states 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will be viable or of value in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
page intellectual property infringement claims could hinder our ability to deliver advertisements over the internet 
we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the network 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
in december  doubleclick  inc filed a patent infringement lawsuit against our subsidiary  sabela media  inc in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the suit alleges that sabela is infringing  and inducing and contributing to the infringement by third parties of  a patent held by doubleclick entitled method for delivery  targeting and measuring advertising over networks 
doubleclick is seeking treble damages in an unspecified amount  a preliminary and permanent injunction from further alleged infringement and attorneys fees and costs 
this litigation can be expected to result in significant expenses to us and the diversion of management time and other resources  the extent of which cannot be quantified with any reasonable accuracy given the early stage of this litigation 
in addition  some of our contracts with web publishers require us to indemnify the web publishers for losses they incur arising from any infringement by our ad serving technology of a third party s intellectual property rights 
if doubleclick is successful in its claims against sabela or files a similar suit against us  we may be hindered or even prevented from competing in the internet advertising market and our operations could be severely harmed 
the doubleclick suit could result in limitations on how we implement our connect for advertisers and publishers product  delays and costs associated with redesigning our connect for advertisers and publishers product and payments of license fees and other monies 
an injunction obtained by doubleclick could eliminate our ability to deliver advertisements over the internet through our connect for advertisers and publishers product 
if doubleclick is successful in its claims against sabela  we cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into a licensing agreement with doubleclick on commercially reasonable terms  if at all for our connect for advertisers and publishers product 
in that case  we would be required to alter our technology in a way that would not infringe the doubleclick patent  and we cannot assure you that these alterations would be successful 
intellectual property liability 
we may be liable for content available or posted on the web sites of our publishers 
we may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising we serve if the music  artwork  text or other content involved violates the copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights of such third parties or if the content is defamatory 
any claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or divert management s attention 
privacy concerns may prevent us from collecting demographic or other consumer data 
our connect technology targets advertising to users through the use of identifying data  or cookies and other non personally identifying information 
connect enables the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising  to help compile demographic information  and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to the user 
any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our targeting capabilities 
due to privacy concerns  some internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies have suggested that the use of cookies be limited or eliminated 
the effectiveness of our connect technology to deliver targeted advertisements could be limited by any regulation or limitation in the collection or use of information regarding internet users 
since many of the limitations are still in the proposal stage  we cannot yet determine the full impact of these regulations on our business 
in addition  we are developing our profilz database to collect data derived from user activity on our networks and from other sources 
we collect and compile information in databases for the product offerings of all our businesses 
individuals or entities may claim in the future  that our collection of this information is illegal 
although we believe that we have the right to use and compile the information in these databases  we cannot assure you that our ability to do so will remain lawful  that any trade secret  copyright or other intellectual property protection will be available for our databases  or that statutory protection that is or becomes available for databases will enhance our rights 
in page addition  others may claim rights to the information in our databases 
further  pursuant to our contracts with web publishers using our solutions  we are obligated to keep certain information regarding each web publisher confidential and  therefore  may be restricted from further using that information in our business 
changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users and other individuals could harm our business 
growing public concern regarding privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals has led to increased federal and state scrutiny and legislative and regulatory activity 
in addition  the high technology and direct marketing industries are considering various new  additional or different self regulatory standards 
this focus  and any legislation  regulations or standards promulgated  impacts us 
the us federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in october  the european union adopted a directive that may limit our collection and use of information regarding internet users in europe 
various technology and direct marketing industry groups have also been addressing this issue 
the network advertising initiative  an industry self regulatory group comprised of third party ad servers  including us  has proposed a series of self regulatory principles 
we cannot assure you that the federal trade commission and the department of commerce will endorse these principles  and the position that these agencies adopt may be more adverse to us than those currently under discussion 
other trade associations are active as well 
the online privacy alliance  a broad coalition of high technology companies  is examining fair information practices and may offer proposals for industry acceptance 
the direct marketing association  or dma  the leading trade association of direct marketers  has adopted guidelines regarding the fair use of information which it recommends that industry participants  including us  follow 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws which limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
although our compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on us  governments  trade associations and industry self regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws  regulations and guidelines  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  for us and our clients 
these regulations and guidelines could materially and adversely affect the business  financial condition and results of operations of our business 
furthermore  computer users may also use software designed to filter or prevent the delivery of advertising to their computers 
we cannot assure you that the number of computer users who employ filtering software will not increase or that additional web publishers will not seek contractual provisions barring us from developing profiles of users of their web sites  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  as a consequence of governmental legislation or regulation or enforcement efforts or evolving standards of fair information collection practices  we may be required to make changes to our products or services in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of the product or service or its attractiveness to potential customers  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the united states congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
page in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
dependence on the web infrastructure 
our success will depend  in large part  upon the maintenance of the web infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and timely development of enabling products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable web access and services and improved content 
we cannot assure you that the web infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the web continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may have to spend considerable amounts to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the web has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure 
such outages and delays could impact the clients using our solutions and the level of user traffic on web sites on our networks 
risks associated with technological change 
the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
interest rate risk  market risk and currency rate fluctuations 
media s investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by media 
media s accounts receivables are subject  in the normal course of business  to collection risks 
media regularly assesses these risks and has established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of collection risks 
as a result  media does not anticipate any material losses in this area 
we transact business in various foreign countries 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses in the countries whore currency is the euro 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for was not material 
media does not use derivative financial instruments to limit its foreign currency risk exposure
