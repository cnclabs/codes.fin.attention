euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency unit and irrevocably established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
during the three year transition period between january  and january   the euro will be a cashless currency  existing only as a unit of account 
payments made to accounts in these member states may be made either in the denominated legacy currency unit of the account or in euros 
beginning on january   euro banknotes and coins will be introduced  and legacy currency banknotes and coins will be withdrawn from circulation 
no later than july   the euro will be the sole national currency unit in these member states  and the legacy currency banknotes and coins will no longer be accepted as legal tender 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its business within the member countries of the european union  and accordingly its existing systems are generally capable of accommodating multiple currencies  including the euro 
the company is assessing the potential impact from the euro conversion in a number of areas  including the following the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  the impact on currency exchange costs and currency exchange rate risk  and the impact on existing contracts 
as of december   the impact of the euro conversion has not had a material impact on the operations of the company 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have historically failed to meet covenants in our loan agreements and may face difficulties in meeting them in the future 
we financed a significant portion of the acquisition of our neurosurgical instruments business with million of subordinated debt borrowed from an affiliate of jh whitney co  one of our significant stockholders 
subsequently  we entered into a million senior secured debt facility with brown brothers harriman co 
in connection with this refinancing  we negotiated covenants relating to the operation of our business 
as of december   we were not in compliance with certain of the debt covenants 
in connection with our recent sale of a portion of the neurosurgical instruments business  we obtained a waiver of default from each lender 
although we believe that we will be able to satisfy the covenants as modified  our failure to meet our financial plan could result in our breach of certain of the covenants 
if we breach any of these covenants and are not successful in obtaining a waiver  either noteholder could demand immediate repayment of the note 
in addition  in the event of a breach of certain of the covenants  the interest rate we owe in connection with the debt may increase 
we may seek to refinance this debt 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance on terms that are favorable to us or at all 
we may face difficulties in satisfying our future capital requirements 
in the event that we are unable to obtain access to additional capital on terms that are favorable to us or at all  we may fail to meet our financial plan 
moreover  our failure to meet our financial plan could result in our breach of certain debt covenants 
our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including 
product sales  
progress of research and development programs and preclinical and clinical testing  
cost and time involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and 
unanticipated needs for capital  such as  a successful claim for indemnification by the buyer of our neurosurgical instruments business against us under the purchase agreement 
we face challenges in refocusing our business strategy 
in connection with the commercialization of our cardioseal product and the recent sale of a portion of our neurosurgical instruments business  we have had to refocus our business strategy 
this refocusing has placed significant demands on management and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage and implement our refocused business strategy effectively  including by 
developing and improving our operational  financial and other internal systems  
improving our sales and marketing capabilities  and 
continuing to train  motivate and manage our employees 
we face uncertainties with respect to commercialization  product development and market acceptance of our products 
before certain of our products can be marketed and sold in the united states  including our cardioseal product  we may be required to conduct further research  product development  preclinical and clinical testing and obtain additional governmental regulatory approvals 
we cannot be certain that our current products  or products currently under development  will achieve or continue to have market acceptance 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by surgery  drugs or other medical devices 
currently  the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments  and these other treatments have a long history of use 
we cannot be certain that our devices and procedures will be able to replace such established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community  in general  will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop additional products 
even if we determine that a product candidate has medical benefits  the cost of commercializing that product candidate may be too high to justify development 
in addition  competitors may develop products that are more effective  cost less or are ready for commercial introduction before our products 
if we are unable to develop additional  commercially viable products  our future prospects will be limited 
we may be unable to compete successfully because of intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
existing and future products  therapies  technological approaches and delivery systems will continue to compete directly with our products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  greater research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources and experience and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  new surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current or future procedures that utilize our products 
as a result  any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with development of these products 
our future success may depend in part upon maintenance of business relationships with collaborators 
we have entered into distribution agreements with bard radiology and bard international granting them exclusive distribution rights to our snf  and into a license agreement with boston scientific granting boston scientific exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture  market and distribute our stent technology  along with products incorporating such technology 
although bard radiology and bard international have agreed not to sell competing filters  boston scientific is not prohibited from selling other stents and  in fact  manufactures and licenses from others a variety of stents that may compete with our stents 
boston scientific may choose to emphasize such other stents in its developmental and marketing efforts 
we cannot be certain that our arrangements will be renewed or that our existing relationships with bard radiology  bard international or boston scientific will continue in their current form 
our business could be materially adversely affected if these arrangements prove unsuccessful or if these companies terminate their arrangements with us  negotiate lower prices  sell additional competing products  whether manufactured by themselves or others  or otherwise alter the nature of their relationships with us 
our limited manufacturing history  dependence on third party manufacturers and the possibility of non compliance with manufacturing regulations raise uncertainties with respect to our ability to commercialize future products 
we use third parties to manufacture and distribute certain of our products 
if our third party manufacturers experience delays or difficulties in producing  packaging or distributing our products  market introduction and subsequent sales of such products would be adversely affected  and we might have to seek alternative sources of supply 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to commercialize medical products as planned 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards including  but not limited to  good manufacturing practice and iso these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production or purchasing costs and may even prevent us from making or obtaining our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we  or a third party manufacturer  change our approved manufacturing process  the fda will require a new approval before that process could be used 
failure to develop our manufacturing capabilities may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 
we may be unable to successfully market our products due to limited marketing and sales experience 
our neurosurgical implants and septal repair devices are generally marketed directly through our direct sales force 
because we have marketed our older products through third parties  we have limited experience marketing our products 
in order to market directly the cardioseal septal occluder and any related products  we will have to develop a marketing and sales organization with technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may face intellectual property infringement claims 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be certain that 
any pending patent applications or any future patent application will result in issued patents  
the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us  
any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged  or 
others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by us 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that others have not or will not develop similar products  duplicate any of our products or design around any patents issued or that may be issued in the future to us or to our licensors 
whether or not patents are issued to us or to our licensors  others may hold or receive patents which contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending any patent infringement suits or in asserting any patent rights  including those granted by third parties 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as a result of government regulations  we may experience lower sales and earnings 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices intended for commercial distribution are subject to extensive governmental regulations in the united states 
medical devices generally require pre market clearance or pre market approval prior to commercial distribution 
certain material changes or modifications to medical devices are also subject to regulatory review and clearance or approval 
the regulatory approval process is expensive  uncertain and lengthy 
if granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
in addition  any products that we manufacture or distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the fda 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our products on a timely basis or at all 
the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  regulatory approvals or clearances  
the loss of previously received approvals or clearances  
limitations on the intended use of a device imposed as a condition of regulatory approvals or clearances  or 
our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
in addition  sales of medical device products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face uncertainties with respect to the availability of third party reimbursement 
in the united states  medicare  medicaid and other government insurance programs  as well as private insurance reimbursement programs  greatly affect revenues for suppliers of health care products and services 
such third party payors may affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount  if any  of reimbursement which they provide to the physicians and clinics using our devices  or any other products that we may develop 
if  for any reason  the third party payors decided not to provide reimbursement for our products  this would materially adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
moreover  mounting concerns about rising health care costs may cause the government or private insurers to implement more restrictive coverage and reimbursement policies in the future 
in the international market  reimbursement by private third party medical insurance providers and by governmental insurers and providers varies from country to country 
in certain countries  our ability to achieve significant market penetration may depend upon the availability of third party governmental reimbursement 
we may not have successfully redesigned the clamshell septal repair device 
between and  bard sponsored trials of an earlier version of the septal repair device  known as the clamshell 
in  bard discovered fractures of the stainless steel framework in certain of the devices implanted during such clinical trials and  following such discovery  suspended its clinical trials worldwide except for patients whose status of being at high risk for surgery made their use of the clamshell particularly necessary 
we determined that the fractures were caused by metal fatigue  resulting from higher than anticipated forces acting on the clamshell 
our redesign efforts resulted in the design of the current version of the septal repair device 
although the cardioseal septal occluder has undergone in vitro testing and has obtained limited humanitarian use designation by the fda  we cannot be certain that such testing accurately simulates the actual forces in the human body or that similar fractures will not occur with the cardioseal septal occluder 
if such fractures occur with adverse clinical consequences  our efforts to commercialize the cardioseal septal occluder may be significantly delayed  as we may be required to invest significant resources in further design and engineering of the device  or we may even have to discontinue development efforts 
product liability claims  product recalls and uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the testing  marketing and sale of implantable devices and materials carry an inherent risk that users will assert product liability claims against us or our third party distributors 
in these lawsuits  users might allege that their use of our devices had adverse effects on their health 
a product liability claim or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our devices are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death 
although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that in the future we will be able to maintain such coverage on acceptable terms or that current insurance or insurance subsequently obtained will provide adequate coverage against any or all potential claims 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will avoid significant product liability claims and the attendant adverse publicity 
any product liability claim or other claim with respect to uninsured or underinsured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
intense industry competition for qualified employees threatens our ability to attract and retain necessary  qualified personnel 
in the medical device field  there is intense competition for qualified personnel  and we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
both the loss of the services of existing personnel as well as the failure to recruit additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner would be detrimental to our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise such as marketing 
the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the our business
