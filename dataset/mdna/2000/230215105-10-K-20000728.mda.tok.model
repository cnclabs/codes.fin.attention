this growth was offset by a decline of in international sales 
after several years of above average growth  culp s international sales declined in  following an industry wide trend 
the company took steps to mitigate the impact of this trend by significantly curtailing production schedules for certain international targeted fabrics  introducing a new line of printed cotton upholstery fabrics  and shifting its marketing focus to geographic areas where demand appeared more favorable 
the company believes that the significantly smaller decline in international sales for reflects the results of these actions 
the company has a diversified global base of customers and is seeking to broaden that further to minimize exposure to economic uncertainties in any geographic area 
the increased sales by culp home fashions primarily mattress ticking during marked a continuation of the longer term expansion that this division has experienced

since the close of fiscal  the company has experienced weakening demand for its products

this trend  which the company believes also affected other manufacturers of upholstery fabrics  became apparent after the close of and persisted throughout a large percentage of the company s sales of this product line were being shipped directly or indirectly to customers in the emerging consumer markets of russia  other former soviet countries and eastern europe 
all of these areas encountered very weak economic conditions that  in turn  adversely affected demand for furniture and other home furnishings 
during  the company significantly curtailed production schedules for these fabrics and shifted its marketing focus for this product category to geographic areas where demand appears more favorable 
the company also introduced a line of printed cotton upholstery fabrics utilizing some of the same manufacturing assets used to produce wet print and heat transfer printed flock fabrics 
international sales  consisting primarily of upholstery fabrics  decreased to million  down from international shipments accounted for of the company s sales for  down from in the company continued to experience sluggish demand in some international markets during  but broadened its marketing program in other geographic areas 
the increased sales by culp home fashions primarily mattress ticking during were a continuation of the longer term expansion that this division has experienced  which management believes is attributable to the same factors discussed above in the comparison of to gross profit and cost of sales 
gross profit for decreased to million 
the decline was due principally to a sharp decline in international sales 
although the company took substantial steps to reduce operating expenses  it continued to be affected throughout by excess manufacturing capacity and lower absorption of fixed costs 
to help offset the pressure on gross margins  the company instituted a number of actions during a major change involved reorganization from six to four divisions during the first quarter

the cost of raw materials remained relatively stable in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for to compared with in the increase principally related to lower than expected sales for the year  higher marketing costs for new fabric designs  incremental costs from the artee acquisition and increased costs for credit expenses  partially offset by lower accruals for incentive based compensation plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
see additional disclosures about interest rate swap agreements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item above 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company has not experienced any significant changes in market risk since april  the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement and variable rate debt in connection with the industrial revenue bonds 
to lower or limit overall borrowing costs  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of portions of its outstanding debt 
the agreements entitle the company to receive or pay to the counterparty a major bank  on a quarterly basis  the amounts  if any  by which the company s interest payments covered by swap agreements differ from those of the counterparty 
these amounts are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreements and changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impact on the company s results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the april  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately  irrespective of any swaps associated with this debt 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada and purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials in foreign currencies 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the canadian subsidiary 
however  the company generally enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a hedge against its exposure to currency fluctuations on firm commitments to purchase certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
the canadian subsidiary is not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  the impact of a change in the exchange rate at april  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in addition  the company had approximately million of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts as of april  as a result  any change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position as the foreign exchange forward contracts have fixed the exchange rate
