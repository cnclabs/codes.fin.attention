the company s revenues are based on usage in the xpedite  premiere conferencing and retail calling card services business segments and a mix of both usage and monthly fixed fee s in the voicecom business segment 
telecommunications costs consist primarily of the cost of metered and fixed telecommunications related costs incurred in providing the company s services 
direct operating costs consist primarily of salaries and wages  travel  consulting fees and facility costs associated with maintaining and operating the company s various revenue generating platforms and telecommunications networks  regulatory fees and non telecommunications costs directly associated with providing services 
direct sales and marketing costs consist primarily of salaries and wages  travel and entertainment  advertising  commissions and facility costs associated with function of selling or marketing the company s services

ebitda before accrued settlement costs  acquired research and development costs and restructuring  merger and other special charges is defined as net income before taxes  other income expense  depreciation  amortization  accrued settlement costs  acquired research and development costs and restructuring  merger costs and other special charges 
ebitda before accrued settlement costs  acquired research and development costs and restructuring  merger and other special charges is considered a key management performance indicator of financial condition because it excludes the effects of goodwill and intangible amortization attributable to acquisitions primarily acquired using the company s common stock  the effects of prior years cash investing and financing activities that affect current period profitability and the effect of one time cash or non cash charges associated with cash flow before payments for interest and taxes 
ebitda before accrued settlement costs  acquired research and development cost and restructuring  merger and other special charges may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and could be misleading unless all companies and analysts calculate them in the same manner 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the company s financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the voice tel and voicecom systems  inc acquisitions  which have been accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
the following discussion and analysis is prepared on that basis and is discussed on an operating segment basis 
revenues consolidated revenues increased to million in and to million in revenues in the company s operating segments increased as follows 
xpedite revenues increased to million in and  to million in the increase in was attributable to twelve months of revenue in versus ten months in from xpedite systems  inc which was acquired in and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  growth in this unit s asia pacific region and acquisitions made in this segment s european region during the second quarter of the increase in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of xpedite systems  inc in february of 
voicecom revenues decreased to million in and to million in the decrease in was attributable to the expiration of revenue commitments under the strategic alliance agreement with mciworldcom in september  the bankruptcy of two wholesale platform calling card customers in the second quarter of  decreases in its local based voice messaging distribution channel with amway  decreases in its based corporate messaging and calling card programs 
these decreases were offset  in part  by increases in revenue from the company s call center ivr service with bank of america and its orchestrate strategic alliance with healtheon webmd 
the decrease in was attributable to having twelve months of the mciworldcom revenue commitment in versus only nine months in when it expired in september  decreases in its local based voice messaging distribution channel with amway and decreases in its based corporate messaging and calling card programs 

premiere conferencing revenues increased to million in and to in the increase in is attributable to twelve months of revenue in versus nine months in for ats  which was acquired in the second quarter of and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and increases from its unattended conferencing product 
management of this segment anticipates growing this portion of its business in which the conferencing event is fully automated and more profitable as less labor costs are required to support and maintain 

retail calling card services revenues decreased to million in and increased to million in the decrease in is attributable to the exiting of unprofitable prepaid calling card programs in the third quarter of  management s decision in the first quarter of to discontinue its unprofitable direct response advertising in in flight magazines for its worldlink calling card and management s decision in to discontinue unprofitable direct response advertising of its worldlink calling card program with its co branding partners 
in the third quarter of  management decided not to acquire any new customers in this segment because it determined that the cost of acquiring such customers outweighed the revenues generated from these customers 
management expects that further decreases in revenue will occur in this segment as operations discontinue 
management is currently seeking potential buyers for this customer base 
the increase in is attributable to growth in the co branding and collegiate distribution channels for calling card services  offset by declines in its in flight magazine distribution channel 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
gross margins in the company s operating segments are as follows xpedite gross profit margins were  and in   and  respectively 
gross margins increased in due to decreases in per minute telecommunications rates for the xpedite worldwide network 
lower telecommunications costs have become the general industry trend over the past two years 
gross margins were higher in because this segment s business that year was primarily composed of local based voice messaging business in asia pacific  which has inherently higher gross margins due to the absence of per minute long distance charges 
gross margins declined in due to the acquisition of xpedite systems  inc  which had inherently lower gross margins due to the presence of per minute long distance charges 
voicecom gross profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
gross margins declined in primarily due to the expiration of the mciworldcom revenue commitments  offset by lower fixed telecommunications costs  which is a general industry trend 
gross margins increased in due to a better mix of local based messaging revenues versus based corporate messaging services and lower fixed telecommunications costs 
premiere conferencing gross profit margins were   and in  and  respectively 
gross margins increased in due to better pricing in the product mix  along with lower per minute telecommunications costs  which is a general industry trend

retail calling card services gross profit margins were  and in  and  respectively 
gross margins increased in due to the exit of prepaid calling card business in the third quarter of  which had inherently lower gross margins due to the mix of this business being primarily international and lower per minute telecommunications rates offered by its telecommunications providers 
the increase in was due primarily to lower per minute telecommunications rates offered by its telecommunications providers 
lower telecommunications costs have become the general industry trend over the past two years 
direct operating costs consolidated direct operating costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and respectively 
the increase in direct operating costs in as a percent of revenue is primarily attributable to the acquisition of ats  which inherently carries a higher percentage of direct operating costs to revenue versus the other operating segments of the company due to the labor intensive nature of its service delivery associated with its attended conference calling revenues 
direct operating costs for premiere conferencing are approximately of revenues 
this increase was offset in part by reduced operating costs in the voicecom segment from to due to the restructuring of voice tel s operations infrastructure 
the estimated annualized impact on this reduction was approximately million  of which approximately would have been immediately recognized in see the restructuring  merger and other special charges section of this discussion for further details 
the increase in versus is attributable to the growth in the mix of premiere conferencing business from of consolidated revenues in to of consolidated revenues in and decreases in messaging revenues  as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion  creating a higher percentage of fixed facilities costs to support the existing revenue base 
direct sales and marketing consolidated direct sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and respectively 
the decrease in direct sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to a reduction of employees related to duplicative sales force in the voicecom segment as part of the xpedite acquisition 
this duplicative sales force reduction reduced annualized sales and marketing costs by approximately million 
also contributing to this reduction was management s exit of direct response advertising in in flight magazines in its retail calling card unit in the third quarter of management exited this activity due to the increased costs to acquire customers through this channel due to saturation of this marketing channel 
direct sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat between and research and development consolidated research and development costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development costs as a percentage of revenue have increased from to as a result of the company s efforts in developing and bringing to market its orchestrate r product 
in  the company increased efforts to bring to market the first version of orchestrate r  which was rolled out in the second quarter of these costs increased significantly in as the company increased efforts to develop and bring to market its latest version of orchestrate r  called orchestrate r  which management believes will be ready for market in these cost increases in were driven primarily from the acquisition of intellivoice communications  inc  which was the primary developer of orchestrate r  and the sun microsystems agreement  which provided the hardware and support 
orchestrate r is a unified messaging product which combines voice  fax and e mail messaging together on your computer via the internet or from your telephone 
in addition  orchestrate r provides features such as contact manager  calendars and personalized portals to the internet 
general and administrative consolidated general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding one time events surrounding approximately million of one time charges in the second quarter of and million in  consolidated general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
these one time events in the second quarter of consisted of million of bad debt expense related to bankruptcies of two wholesale calling card customers  million of start up costs  primarily executive compensation  incurred in the start up of orchestrate r  million related to stay bonuses earned in connection with the post merger period of the xpedite acquisition and million of asset impairment and other costs 
the one time events in consisted of restricted stock grants to certain executives of a limited number of company owned shares held in certain strategic equity investments 
these company owned shares included  shares of webmd series e common stock and  shares of webmd series f preferred stock  and  shares of usa 
net series c preferred stock 
the vesting periods for these shares ranged from immediately upon grant to three years  contingent on the executive being employed by the company 
excluding the shares subject to these restricted stock grants  the company owned an aggregate of  shares of webmd series e common stock and  shares of webmd series f preferred stock  which represented and was exchanged for  shares of common stock of healtheon webmd  and  shares of usa 
net series c preferred stock 
in connection with this action the company recorded million of non cash expense related to the partial vesting of these grants 
the company will be required to record additional non cash charges of million in   in and  in  reflecting the remaining vesting period associated with these grants 
general and administrative costs  excluding one time charges  increased in from of revenue in to in this increase was primarily driven by costs to build out increased corporate infrastructure  such as increased rent and salaries  and was offset in part by reduced general and administrative costs in the voicecom unit as part of the reduction in field administrative functions of the voice tel acquisition 
the estimated annualized salary savings from the reduction in field administrative functions was approximately million 
see the restructuring  merger and other special charges section of this discussion for further details 
also contributing to this increase was the loss of certain revenue  as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion  without the loss of certain fixed general and administrative costs  such as facilities costs and support personnel 
the significant increase in general and administrative costs in as a percent of revenue from to was primarily driven by significant revenue reductions in the voicecom and retail calling card units as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion and the continued build out of the company s corporate infrastructure in late and early both of these factors combined to outweigh gains made from the administrative reductions realized as part of the restructuring plans of the voice tel and voicecom systems  inc acquisitions 
realizing this continued trend  management acted in the third quarter of on an aggressive workforce reduction at its corporate unit to reverse this unfavorable trend going into approximately million of annualized salary and wage savings will be realized from the third quarter restructuring plan 
for a further outline of this plan  see the restructuring  merger and other special charges section of this discussion 
depreciation consolidated depreciation as a percent of revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
depreciation in the company s operating segments are as follows 
xpedite depreciation costs were and of segment revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in expense as a percent of revenues is primarily due to increased business on existing capacity of the document distribution network and the aging of the network without significant capital additions to increase the capacity 

voicecom depreciation costs were  and of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues from to is attributable to an increase in available capacity due to the revenue decreases  as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion 

premiere conferencing depreciation costs were and of segment revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues from to is attributable to increased capital additions as this segment made significant upgrades during and to its unattended conferencing platform  which management of this segment expects to grow over the next several years 

retail calling card depreciation costs were  and of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues from to is attributable to significant declines in the revenue base as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion  which created significant excess capacity on this network platform and management s decision in the fourth quarter of to reduce the remaining useful life of certain equipment from two to five years down to twelve to fifteen months  which resulted from managements decision in the third quarter of to cease acquiring new customers in this segment and exit this business 

corporate depreciation costs were and million in and  respectively 
the increase in these costs were attributable primarily to the installation of new management information systems  new financial management systems and increased computer equipment purchases 
the new computer equipment purchases were due in part to the infrastructure build out at the corporate level during and early the new management information systems and financial systems were put in place as an overall consolidation of the various legacy systems acquired through the acquisitions of voice tel  voicecom systems  inc  ats and xpedite and to address year concerns 
amortization consolidated amortization as a percent of revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense in was due to the acquisition of xpedite  ats and various international acquisitions  the shortening of the estimated useful economic life of the mciworldcom strategic alliance contract from to three years during the fourth quarter of  as discussed in note strategic alliance contract and in the restructuring  merger and other special charges section of this discussion and the shortening of the estimated useful economic life of existing goodwill and customer lists from the voice tel and ats acquisition from to years to to years during the fourth quarter of the increase in was due to twelve months in versus ten months in of amortization related to xpedite  twelve months in versus nine months in of amortization related to ats  in addition to a full year of amortization under shortened lives in versus three months in  a full year of amortization in under a shortened life related to the mciworldcom strategic alliance contract versus three months in  a full year of amortization of voice tel goodwill and customer lists under shortened lives versus three months in and additional amortization from the acquisitions of xpedite s french affiliate in the second quarter of and the acquisition of intellivoice in the third quarter of  both accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
net interest expense net interest expense increased to million in  from million in and million in net interest expense increased in mainly due to the following factors 
increased average borrowings in versus under the company s revolving line of credit facility that was assumed as part of the acquisition of xpedite in february of 
reduced interest income on the average balance of marketable securities in debt and mutual funds that the company held during versus substantially all of the debt assumed in the acquisition of xpedite was associated with a short term revolving loan facility maintained by xpedite 
in december  the company amended and restated this facility for a one year period 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  the company has paid off and terminated this short term revolving loan facility at december  the increase in average borrowings on the line of credit were primarily due to certain international acquisitions in and capital expenditures used in developing the company s new orchestrate r operating system for the reduced interest income on marketable securities was due to the company s liquidation of certain debt and mutual fund holdings in the early part of  which was used  in part  to fund investments in ptekventures and general capital expenditure needs 
net interest expense increases in versus were primarily due to the following factors 
interest associated with the million of debt assumed in the acquisition of xpedite in february of and million of debt assumed in the acquisition of ats in april of 
reduced interest income on the average balance of marketable securities in debt and mutual funds that the company held during versus the company held million in and million in of marketable securities  primarily debt and mutual funds

acquired research and development costs acquired research and development costs of million expensed in were associated with the acquisition of xpedite 
this cost represents the value assigned to research and development projects in the developmental stage  which had not reached technological feasibility at the date of the acquisition 
the acquired research and development was valued using the income approach  which consisted of estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to this asset over its life and converting this after tax cash flow to present value through discounting 
see note acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ebitda consolidated ebitda before accrued settlement costs  acquired research and development costs and restructuring  merger and other special charges was million or of revenues in  million or or revenues in  and million or of revenues in 
xpedite ebitda was million or of segment revenues  million or of segment revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in ebitda from to was primarily driven by the acquisition of xpedite in february of prior to the acquisition of xpedite  this segment was composed of the messaging business of voice tel in australia and new zealand 
the increase in ebitda to million in was related to twelve months of operating results for xpedite versus ten months in the decline as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by lower ebitda acquisitions made in europe in the latter half of and the first half of  along with start up costs associated with the acquisition of a customer list in the asia pacific region of this business unit 
management of this segment has focused their efforts in europe with the installation of new management focused on bringing the european acquisition s ebitda more in line with ebitda of base operations 

voicecom ebitda was million or of segment revenues  million or of segment revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in ebitda in is attributable to the expiration of revenue commitments from the mciworldcom strategic alliance contract in which little or no telecommunications or selling  general or administrative costs existed in this high margin offering  increased research and development costs associated with orchestrate r  decreases in high margin messaging revenues with very little or no selling  general or administrative costs associated  such as the amway distribution channel and certain corporate messaging customers in which the company provides only maintenance services and the bankruptcy of two significant high margin wholesale calling card customers in which the company incurred very little or no telecommunications costs or selling  general or administrative costs 
these decreases were offset  in part  by administrative and customer service workforce reduction as part of the restructuring plan associated with the reorganization of the company into ces and ees during the fourth quarter of for a further discussion of this reorganization plan  see the restructuring  merger and other special charges section of this discussion 
the decrease in ebitda in was  to a lesser extent  caused by the same conditions which drove the decrease in  along with bad debt expenses associated with the bankruptcy of two wholesale calling card customers 

premiere conferencing ebitda was or of segment revenues  or of segment revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
conferencing revenue in was primarily from the unattended conferencing product offering from voicecom 
the increase in was driven from the acquisition of ats in the second quarter of the increase in ebitda in was primarily driven from twelve months of operations for ats versus nine months of operations in the decline in ebitda as a percent of revenue in is due to start up costs associated with sales and marketing efforts in growing the segment s unattended conferencing product offering 

retail calling card ebitda was million or of segment revenues  million or of segment revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in negative ebitda in is attributable the exiting of unprofitable prepaid calling card programs in the third quarter of  management s decision in the first quarter of to discontinue its unprofitable direct response advertising in in flight magazines for its premiere worldlink calling card and management s decision in to discontinue unprofitable direct response advertising of its premiere worldlink calling card program with its co branding partners 
in the third quarter of  management decided not to acquire any new customers in this segment because it determined that the cost of acquiring such customers outweighed the revenues that these customers could generate for the company 
management expects that further decreases in revenue will occur in this unit as operations wind down 
however  management expects that ebitda will be break even  absent any costs to acquire customers 
management is currently seeking potential buyers for this customer base 
the increase in negative ebitda from to was attributable to prepaid calling card programs  direct response advertising of the premiere worldlink calling card in in flight magazines and co branding relationships to co market the premiere worldlink calling card 
all three programs came under extreme pricing pressures from competitors and the cost to acquire a customer quickly became greater than the expected benefit gained over the life of that customer 
accordingly  management exited the first two programs in and decided in the third quarter of to cease acquiring any new customers 

corporate ebitda was million or of consolidated revenues  million or of consolidated revenues and million or of consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
excluding one time costs of million in and million in  ebitda for those two years would have been million or of consolidated revenues and million or of consolidated revenues 
one time costs in were related to costs associated with restricted stock grants to certain executives of the company  as discussed further in note related party transactions 
one time costs in were associated with a note receivable write off associated with the bankruptcy of a strategic wholesale calling card partner  start up costs  primarily executive compensation  incurred in the start up of its orchestrate 
com  inc subsidiary  stay bonuses earned in connection with the post merger period of the xpedite acquisition and asset impairment and other costs 
the increase in negative ebitda at the corporate level in versus was primarily driven by the build out of a corporate infrastructure in the latter half of and the first half of the increase in negative ebitda in versus is a continuation of the build out of the corporate infrastructure through the third quarter of in the third quarter of  management reorganized the company into a decentralized business model placing many of the corporate functions being built up in the corporate infrastructure back into the new decentralized operating segments 
in many cases these corporate costs were duplicative or deemed unnecessary when pushed down into each operating segment 
accordingly  management expects significant cost savings from this third quarter restructuring

during the third quarter of  management decentralized the company further into six segments consisting of voicecom formerly in the ees and ces groups  xpedite formerly in the ces group  premiere conferencing formerly in the ces group  retail calling card services formerly in the ees group  ptekventures and corporate 
as part of this reorganization  management continued its movement away from integrating its service offerings onto a single unified service platform by further decentralizing the organization from two customer based operating units  ees and ces  into smaller product based or functional cost based operating segments 
the primary focus of this plan was to eliminate a significant portion of the corporate overhead

management initially planned to move the voice tel voice messaging network to the unified messaging platform that the company was developing 
this transition to the new unified messaging platform was intended to allow for the elimination of voice mail equipment sites 
this portion of the voicetel restructuring plan changed during for three reasons 
first  development of the unified messaging platform was delayed due to system customization issues  which delayed the closing of equipment sites 
second  the voice mail equipment manufacturer developed a year software solution and agreed to support the company s equipment  which eliminated the need to replace the existing equipment 
third  the company decided to reorganize into two strategic business units  ces and ees  which would focus on large corporations and smaller enterprises  respectively 
since ces and ees each contained distinct portions of the legacy platforms acquired  management decided to use those legacy platforms rather than complete the unified messaging platform 
therefore  as part of this reorganization  the management for the two new business units determined that their customers would be better served  and the company would optimize operating profits  by continuing to use the existing voice mail equipment and maintaining substantially all of the equipment sites

reorganization of company into ees and ces business units during the fourth quarter of  management reorganized the company into two operating units  ees and ces 
ces would provide services to corporations with large professional staff with communications needs and ees would provide communications services to small office home office  multi level marketing organizations and retail buyers 
ces and ees would use the legacy platforms of the merged companies that made them up 
ces was comprised of xpedite  ats and voicecom systems  inc  which all had large corporate customers 
ees would be comprised of the original calling card business of the company and the voice messaging business of voice tel 
as part of this reorganization into two business units  management abandoned its earlier plans to integrate the services and products acquired in the acquisitions of voice tel  voicecom systems  inc and xpedite onto a single unified service platform and decided not to exit certain duplicative services and products 
this was driven  in part  by the inability of a third party to assist the company in providing a platform that would provide functionality acceptable to the company s customers  and  in part  due to the lack of cross selling product offerings from other acquired businesses 
accordingly  management amended or ceased certain exit plans that were originally established in connection with the prior acquisitions discussed above

in total  million of reserve was reversed  which related to the aggregate of million of charges 
offsetting the million of reserve reversals in the fourth quarter of was a fourth quarter charge of million that reflected management s revision of the initial restructuring plans established in connection with each acquisition 
the major portion of the voice tel restructuring plan that was abandoned was the reduction in the number of voice messaging equipment sites from to the impact of the reversal of this reserve was to increase pretax income by million 
this portion of the plan was abandoned due primarily to delays in developing a unified messaging platform and a new focus on customers on existing legacy platforms as part of the ees and ces reorganization 
see discussion under voice tel acquisitions 
as a result of the corporate reorganization into two business units  ces and ees  the company revised its plan to close its cleveland site  which was initiated as part of the voice tel restructuring plan 
this closure plan was behind schedule under the original plan due to the company s initiatives to close the voicecom systems  inc corporate headquarters into cleveland first as an overall step to closing the voicecom and voice tel headquarters into the company s atlanta headquarters 
accordingly  new ces and ees management postponed the closure into the first six months of the company reversed million of reserve under this portion of the voice tel restructuring plan  and established million under the new plan 
the difference between the two charges is additional severance from increased headcount at the time of the revised plan 
the fourth quarter net reduction of million in asset valuation allowances is attributable to a reversal of million from the voice tel acquisition and a new valuation allowance of million under the reorganization of the company into two business units  ees and ces 
the asset valuation allowances not used as part of the voice tel acquisition related to the cleveland administrative office site that management decided in the fourth quarter of to postpone closing until also in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed million of accruals related to transaction costs that were anticipated but ultimately were not incurred 
the new valuation allowances of million related to certain switching equipment associated with the company s enhanced calling services 
this switching equipment was determined to be no longer operational due to the reduced volume of business associated with the enhanced calling services product and is anticipated to be disposed of within twelve months of management s decision 
these two switches were purchased by the company in the second quarter of but were never placed into service 
they remained idle due to the bankruptcy of two license customers that had significant volumes of business with the company 
during the third quarter of management looked for alternative uses for this equipment including the use in potential prepaid calling card business and international calling card programs 
during the fourth quarter of  management reorganized the company into two business units  ces and ees 
the new management of these units decided at that time that forecasted volume for the type of business used for these switches over the switches useful lives would not justify the additional capacity that these switches brought to the company s network 
either potential buyers would be sought or the switches would be used for spare parts on like switches in the company s network 
therefore the company charged a valuation reserve in the fourth quarter of to reduce the asset carrying value to its estimated scrap value 
the fourth quarter net increase of million in severance and exit costs is attributable to a reversal of million from the voice tel acquisition  million related to the xpedite acquisition and a million charge related to the charge taken under the reorganization of the company into two business units  ees and ces

management expects completion of these exit activities to take months subsequent to the fourth quarter of the severance and exit costs not used as part of the first quarter charge relate to management s revision of the plan to exit a certain operational site 
under the revised plan  management intends to exit this site within months subsequent to the fourth quarter of the annual costs savings from the termination of employees and from this site closure is anticipated to be approximately million 
the establishment of additional severance and exit costs from various other reserve reversals is a result of management s decision in the fourth quarter of to terminate managers associated with the acquisitions of voice tel  voicecom systems  inc and xpedite 
the estimated annual cost savings from these terminations is approximately million 
the severance associated with these managers is expected to be paid over one to three years 
the fourth quarter net reduction of million in contractual obligations is attributable to a reversal of million from the voice tel acquisition  million related to the voicecom systems  inc acquisition  million related to the xpedite acquisition and a new charge of million taken under the reorganization of the company into two business units  ees and ces 
the contractual obligations not used as part of the voice tel acquisition relate to management s decision not to exit certain equipment sites and the revision of management s plan to exit the voice tel corporate headquarters 
the contractual obligations not used as part of the voicecom systems  inc acquisition were attributable to management s ability to sublease the former headquarters of voicecom systems  inc to a third party for the final year of the lease obligation 
the charge taken in the fourth quarter is associated with management s plan to exit the voice tel corporate headquarters and a certain xpedite operational site 
management expects these revised plans to require a cash outlay within the next months 
the fourth quarter net reduction of million in transaction obligations is attributable to a reversal of million from the voice tel acquisition  million related to the voicecom systems  inc acquisition and million from the xpedite acquisition 
the reversals related to the voice tel  voicecom systems  inc and xpedite acquisition are related to actual payments being less than anticipated by management s original estimate 
the fourth quarter net increase of million in other costs  primarily to exit facilities and certain activities  is attributable to a reversal of approximately  related to the voice tel acquisition  million related to the first quarter charge and million related to the charge taken as part of the reorganization of the company into two business units  ees and ces of various other reserve reversals 
the reversals related to both the voice tel and first quarter charge are related to actual payments being less than anticipated by management s original estimate 
the charge of million is attributable to increased estimates of exit costs associated with management s revised plan to terminate approximately managers associated with previous acquisitions  the exit of the voice tel corporate headquarters and the exit of various voice tel regional administrative functions 
management estimates that all such costs will be cash outlays  which will be paid over the next months

the million charge is comprised of million of severance and exit costs  million of lease termination costs and million of facility exit costs 
severance and exit costs are attributable to the termination of employees  of which employees were associated with the voicecom segment  employees associated with the corporate segment and employees associated with the xpedite segment

the employees in the voicecom segment were primarily related to the direct sales force and executive management of the former ees operating unit 
the employees at corporate were primarily related to executive financial and administrative functions at the corporate headquarters

factors affecting future performance risks related to our industry the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors  which may make it difficult to maintain or increase our market share and revenue 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  and they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their product and service offerings and that new competitors are likely to enter our markets 
existing and new competitors may attempt to integrate their products and services  resulting in greater competition 
increased competition could result in price pressure on our products and services and a decrease in our market share in the various markets in which we compete  either of which could hinder our ability to grow our revenue 
the telecommunications act of may increase competition in the markets in which we compete 
the telecommunications act of is intended to increase competition in the long distance and local telecommunications markets 
we may experience increased competition from others  including the regional bell operating companies  as a result of this law 
this law opens competition in the local services market and  at the same time  contains provisions intended to protect consumers and businesses from unfair competition by incumbent local exchange carriers  which generally are local telephone companies that provided local telephone services on the date of the enactment of the law  and which includes the regional bell operating companies 
the telecommunications act of allows the regional bell operating companies to provide long distance service within and between local access and transport areas that are outside of their local service territories 
local access and transport areas are geographic areas in the us within which incumbent local telephone companies traditionally offered local telephone services 
however  this legislation prohibits the regional bell operating companies from offering long distance services in their local service territory that originate in one local access and transport area and terminate in another  unless they satisfy various conditions 
a regional bell operating company must apply to the fcc to provide long distance services in their local service territory and they must satisfy a set of pro competitive criteria intended to ensure that they open their own local markets to competition before the fcc will approve their application 
the fcc has recently granted approval to bell atlantic to provide this type of long distance service in new york  and the fcc may grant approval to similar applicants in the future 
we may experience increased competition if  and when  the fcc grants these applications 
this legislation also grants the fcc broad authority to deregulate other aspects of the telecommunications industry 
if the fcc implements deregulation of other aspects of the telecommunications industry in the future  it could facilitate the offering of competitive products and services by the regional bell operating companies  which would increase the amount of competition we face 
the development of alternatives to our products and services may cause us to lose customers and market share  and may hinder our ability to maintain or grow our revenue 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced that will compete with our products and services 
technological advances may result in the development and commercial availability of alternatives to our products and services or new methods of delivering our products and services 
companies may develop and offer product features  service offerings or pricing options which are more attractive to customers than those currently offered by us 
these new products or services  or methods of delivering these products or services could 
cause our existing products and services to become obsolete  
be more cost effective  which could result in significant pricing pressure on or products and services  or 
allow our existing and potential customers to meet their own telecommunications needs without using our services 
technological changes that make our products obsolete  or changes in technology that allow competitors to offer products and services that replace our existing products and services could cause us to lose customers  market share and revenue 
if new products and services that we develop and introduce are not accepted in the marketplace  we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease 
we must continually introduce new products and services in response to technological changes  evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to our existing products and services 
we will not be able to increase our revenue if we are unable to develop new products and services  or if we experience delays in the introduction of new products and services  or if our new products and services do not achieve market acceptance 
our ability to successfully develop and market new products and services and enhancements that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or customer demands  is dependent on our ability to 
anticipate changes in industry standards  
anticipate and apply advances in technologies  
enhance our software  applications  equipment  systems and networks  
attract and retain qualified and creative technical personnel  
develop effective marketing  pricing and distribution strategies for new products and services  or 
avoid difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services or enhancements 
we are subject to pricing pressures for our products and services  which could cause us to lose market share and revenue 
we compete for consumers based on price 
a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by our competitors could cause us to reduce the rates we charge for our products and services 
if we cannot compete based on price  we may lose market share 
if we reduce our rates without increasing our margins or our market share  our revenue could decrease 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could be disruptive to our licensing and strategic relationships 
the telecommunications industry has experienced  and we believe it will continue to experience  consolidation 
for example  worldcom  a strategic partner of ours  merged with mci communications corp  a competitor of ours with respect to some services  to form mci worldcom 
in addition  mci worldcom has announced a merger with sprint corporation  a competitor of ours with respect to some services 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry  including consolidations involving our customers  competitors  strategic partners and licensing partners  could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could be disruptive to our licensing and strategic relationships 
risks related to our company one of our growth strategies is to make investments and form alliances with early stage companies involved in emerging technologies  and these investments may not be successful 
part of our growth strategy is to make equity investments in companies involved in emerging technologies 
these equity investments allow us to develop marketing and strategic alliances  which serve as an important vehicle through which we market our own web enabled services  such as orchestrate r 
we made investments of approximately million in and million in to acquire initial equity interests  or increase existing equity interests  in companies engaged in emerging technologies 
since many of the companies in which we make investments are small  early stage companies  our investments are subject to the significant risks faced by these companies  which could result in the loss of our investment 
we may not have opportunities to acquire equity interests in additional companies  which could impede our growth strategy 
our equity investments  which are typically made through or held by a subsidiary  have significant value on a stand alone basis 
in the future  we may not be able to identify companies that complement our strategy  and even if we identify a company that complements our strategy  we may not be able to acquire an interest in the company 
if we cannot acquire equity interests in attractive companies  our growth strategy may not succeed 
we may not be able to acquire equity interests in attractive companies for many reasons  including 
a failure to agree on the terms of the acquisition  such as the amount or price of our acquired interest  
incompatibility between us and management of the company  
competition with other investors to make equity investments in the same company  
a lack of capital to acquire an interest in the company  and 
the unwillingness of the company to enter into a strategic agreement with us or to provide us with an equity interest 
we may be unable to obtain maximum value for our equity investments 
we have significant positions in several public and private companies  including healtheon webmd corporation  s corporation  usa 
net  inc  webforia  inc and derivion corporation 
we may from time to time sell or otherwise monetize all or a portion of these investments to provide working capital or for other business purposes 
for example  in november and december we sold a significant portion of our healtheon webmd holdings in open market transactions and used substantially all of the proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility 
if we divest all or part of any equity interest  we may not receive maximum value for our position 
for equity investments in publicly traded stock  we may be unable to sell our interests at then quoted market prices 
furthermore  for those equity interests that are not publicly traded  the realizable value of our interest may ultimately prove to be lower than the carrying value currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of our business may fluctuate because the value of some of our equity investments fluctuates 
a portion of our assets includes the equity securities of both publicly traded and non publicly traded companies 
in particular  we own a significant number of shares of common stock of healtheon webmd and s corporation  which are publicly traded companies 
the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in these and other companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control 
fluctuations in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies may result in fluctuations of the market price of our common stock and may reduce the amount of working capital we have available 
we may incur significant costs and may be forced to make disadvantageous business decisions to avoid investment company status  and we may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company 
we may incur significant costs and may be forced to make disadvantageous business decisions to avoid investment company status 
for example  we may be forced to forego attractive investment opportunities or we may have to dispose of investments before we might otherwise do so in order to avoid investment company status 
furthermore  we may suffer other adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of some investments made by us may constitute investment securities under the act 
in some instances  a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding of its total assets  subject to various exclusions 
in other instances  a company may be deemed to be an investment company if more than of its total assets consists of  and more than of its net income after taxes attributable to it over the last four quarters is derived from  ownership interests in companies it does not control  subject to various exclusions 
investment companies are subject to registration under  and compliance with  the act  unless a particular exclusion or safe harbor applies 
if we are deemed to be an investment company and we register as one with the sec  we would become subject to the requirements of the act 
as a consequence  we could be prohibited from engaging in business or issuing our securities in the manner we have in the past 
if we are deemed to be an unlawfully unregistered investment company  we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  some of our contracts might be voidable  and a court appointed receiver could take control of us and liquidate our business 
if we cannot implement a plan to segregate our web related assets and develop strategic partnership and alliances  we may not be able to implement our growth strategy 
on october   we announced that we are developing plans to segregate our web related assets in stand alone entities for which we will seek strategic partnerships and other strategic alliances 
we currently have no specific plans  agreements or commitments with respect to the segregation of our web related assets  or any strategic partnerships or alliances with respect to those assets 
moreover  we may not be able to identify suitable strategic partners or alliances with respect to our web related assets 
even if we identify suitable strategic partners and alliances  we may not be able to negotiate or consummate any particular partnership or alliance 
if we cannot implement a plan to segregate our web related assets and develop strategic partnership and alliances  we may not be able to implement our growth strategy 
if our strategic relationships are not successful we may not be able to increase our sales and revenue 
a principal element of our strategic plan is the creation and maintenance of strategic relationships that will enable us to offer our products and services to a larger customer base than we could otherwise reach through our direct marketing efforts 
examples of our strategic partners include mci worldcom  healtheon webmd and webforia 
failure of one or more of our strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for our services  or the termination of one or more of our relationships with a strategic partner  could hinder our ability to increase our sales and our revenue 
although we view our strategic relationships as a key factor in our overall business strategy and in the development and commercialization of our products and services  our strategic partners may not view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses and any one of them could reassess their commitment to us in the future 
the ability of our strategic partners to incorporate our products and services into successful commercial ventures will require us  among other things  to continue to successfully enhance our existing products and services and develop new ones 
our inability to meet the requirements of our strategic partners or to comply with the terms of our strategic partner arrangements could result in our strategic partners failing to market our services  seeking alternative providers of communications and information services or canceling their contracts with us 
if our strategic relationship with mci worldcom is not successful we may not be able to increase our sales and our revenue 
in november  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with worldcom  now known as mci worldcom  whereby mci worldcom is required  among other things  to provide us with the right of first opportunity to provide computer telephony services for a period of at least years 
in connection with this agreement  we issued to mci worldcom  shares of common stock valued at approximately million and paid mci worldcom million in cash 
we recorded the value of this agreement as an intangible asset 
if this strategic relationship is not successful it could hinder our ability to increase our sales and our revenue 
subsequent to entering into this strategic alliance agreement  worldcom merged with mci  a competitor of ours with respect to same services  to form mci worldcom 
the minimum payment levels under the strategic alliance agreement ceased at the end of september and current activity levels are significantly below those prior minimums 
in addition  in june  we filed a lawsuit against mci worldcom alleging breach of this strategic alliance agreement 
this lawsuit has been stayed pending arbitration 
we periodically review this intangible asset for impairment and in we wrote down the carrying value of the mci worldcom strategic alliance intangible asset by approximately million 
in addition  we accelerated amortization of the remaining carrying value of the asset starting in the fourth quarter of by shortening its estimated remaining useful life to three years from years 
financial difficulties of our strategic partners or licensees could adversely impact our earnings 
the majority of companies that have chosen to outsource their communications services to us are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
if any of our strategic partners or licensees suffer financial difficulties  it could hurt our financial performance and adversely impact our earnings 
for example  during the second quarter of  a licensing customer and a strategic partner in our enhanced calling services group initiated proceedings under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we recorded approximately million of charges in the second quarter of associated with uncollectible accounts receivable  primarily related to these financially distressed customers 
the financial difficulties of these two customers  as well as revenue shortfalls in the voice and data messaging group and other unanticipated costs and one time charges  contributed to an after tax loss for the second quarter of our future success depends on market acceptance of our unified messaging products and services  which includes orchestrate r 
unified messaging  also known as integrated messaging  allows a person to access all of their messaging devices  such as voice mail  e mail and facsimile  from a computer or telephone 
market acceptance of unified messaging products and services generally requires that individuals and enterprises accept new ways of communicating and exchanging information 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  our unified messaging products and services could hinder our ability to maintain and increase our revenue 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our unified messaging products and services will depend on several factors  including 
ease of use  
price  
reliability  
access and quality of service  
system security  
product functionality  and 
the effectiveness of strategic marketing and distribution relationships 
if we do not met these challenges  our unified messaging products and services  including orchestrate  may not achieve broad market acceptance or market acceptance may not occur quickly enough to justify our investment in these products and services 
concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may have an adverse impact on the market acceptance of our web enabled products and services  including orchestrate r 
we believe the concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet prevents many potential customers from using internet related products and services 
if our web enabled services  such as orchestrate r  do not include sufficient security features  our web enabled products and services may not gain market acceptance  or there may be additional legal exposure 
despite the measures we have taken  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person circumvents our security measures  he or she could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruption in our operations 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may be required to make significant investments in efforts to protect against a remedy of these types of security breaches 
additionally  as electronic commerce becomes more widespread  our customers will become more concerned about security 
if we are unable to adequately address these concerns  we may be unable to sell our web enabled products and services 
if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price may decrease 
quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations  we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include 
the unique nature of strategic relationships into which we may enter in the future  
changes in operating expenses resulting from our strategic relationships and other factors  
the financial performance of our strategic partners  
the performance of strategic equity investments  
the timing of new product and service announcements  
market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  including orchestrate  
the success or failure of past or potential future acquisitions  
changes in legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our products and services  and 
general economic and seasonal factors 
in the future  revenue from our strategic investments and strategic relationships may become an increasingly significant portion of our total revenue 
due to the unique nature of each strategic investment and relationship  these investments and relationships may change the mix of our expenses relative to our revenue 
if we are not able to expand our document distribution services  it may adversely affect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we provide document distribution services 
we intend to accelerate growth of our document distribution services throughout the world by expansion of our proprietary private worldwide document distribution network and the acquisition of entities engaged in the business of document distribution services 
we may not be able to expand our ability to 
provide document distribution services at a rate or in a manner satisfactory to meet the demands of existing or future customers  
increase the capacity of our document distribution network to process increasing amounts of document traffic  
integrate and increase the capability of our document distribution network to perform tasks required by our customers  or 
identify and establish alliances with new partners in order to enable us to expand our document distribution network into new geographic regions 
if we are not able to accomplish these things it could adversely affect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we provide document distribution services 
in addition  this growth will involve substantial investments of capital  management and other resources 
we may not generate sufficient cash for future growth of our document distribution business through earnings or external financings  and external financings may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
further  we may not be able to employ any of these resources in a manner that will result in accelerated growth 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers and our customers may not transact business with us in the future 
we expect that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than our technologies 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and our customers may not continue to transact business with us in the future if 
our products and services become obsolete  
competitors develop products and services that are more sophisticated  efficient or cost effective  or 
technological advances allow our customers to satisfy their own telecommunications needs 
we rely on amway corporation for significant revenue and any loss of business from amway may hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
we have historically relied on sales through amway corporation for a substantial portion of our revenue 
sales to amway accounted for approximately of our revenue in  in  in and in although total revenue from amway has decreased significantly  amway remains a significant customer 
our relationship with amway and its distributors may not continue at historical levels  and there is no long term price protection for services provided to amway 
continued loss in total revenue from amway or diminution in the amway relationship  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
if we do not attract and retain highly qualified and creative technical personnel we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
we believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified and creative engineering and product development personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified and creative personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled technical employees with appropriate qualifications 
we may not be able to retain our key technical employees and we may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
if we are not able to locate  hire and retain qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our business may suffer if we do not retain the services of our chief executive officer 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the familiarity of mr 
jones with the markets in which we compete and emerging technologies  such as the internet  makes him especially critical to our success 
we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
jones in the amount of million 
downtime in our network infrastructure could result in the loss of significant customers 
we currently maintain facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls and computer telephony equipment in approximately locations throughout the world 
the delivery of our products and services is dependent  in part  upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future 
these types of service interruptions could result in the loss of significant customers  which could cause us to lose revenue 
we take substantial precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware  fire protection systems and other contingency plans 
in addition  some of our networks are designed so that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
we also maintain business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance in the future  it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices  and it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
if or our frame relay network architecture becomes obsolete  we may have to invest significant capital to upgrade or replace our private frame relay network 
we made a significant investment in a private frame relay network when we acquired voice tel in a frame relay network is a telecommunications network that uses packet switching to transmit data through the network and relies on high quality phone lines to minimize errors 
packet switching is a process that allows data to be subdivided into individual packets of data  each packet carrying its own destination address 
the packets are then reassembled at their final destination 
packet switching is an efficient method of moving data over a network because each packet can go a different route 
there are alternative network architectures  which are the structures and protocols of any computer network  including emerging broadband networks 
moreover  technological advances may lead to the development of additional network architectures 
if the telecommunications industry standardizes on an architecture other than frame relay or our private frame relay network becomes obsolete  we would need to invest significant capital to upgrade or replace our private frame relay network 
if we fail to predict growth in our network usage and add needed capacity  then the quality of our service offerings may suffer 
at network usage grows  we will need to add capacity to our hardware and software  our facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls and our private frame relay network 
this means that we continuously attempt to predict growth in our network usage and add capacity accordingly 
if we do not accurately predict and efficiently manage growth in our network usage  the quality of our service offerings may suffer and we may lose customers 
software failures or errors may result in failure of our platforms and or networks  which could result in increased costs and lead to interruptions in our services and losses of significant customers and revenue 
the software that we have developed and utilized in providing our products and services  including the orchestrate software  may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or product equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our networks or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices 
even if we maintain this insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
interruption in long distance telecommunications services could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunication services on favorable terms from long distance carriers 
we do not own a transmission network 
as a result  we depend on mci worldcom  at t  teleglobe inc and cable wireless  and other long distance carriers for transmission of our customers long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured under supply agreements with multiyear terms 
these supply agreements are subject to various early termination penalties and minimum purchase requirements 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of long distance service  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
the partial or total loss of our ability to receive or terminate telephone calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we depend on local phone companies that provide local transmission services  known as local exchange carriers  as well as companies that purchase and resell local transmission services  known as competitive local exchange carriers  for call origination and termination 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
if we have to relocate our equipment or change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our services and increased costs  which could cause us to lose customers 
we lease capacity on the mci worldcom communications network to provide network connections and data transmission within our private frame relay network 
our telecommunications agreement with mci worldcom expires in september we have equipment co located at various mci worldcom sites under co location agreements that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
our ability to maintain network connections is dependent upon our access to transmission facilities provided by mci worldcom or an alternative provider 
we may not be able to continue our relationship with mci worldcom beyond the terms of our current agreements and we may not be able to find an alternative provider on terms as favorable as those offered by mci worldcom or on any other terms 
if we have to relocate our equipment or change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our service and or increased costs  which could adversely effect our customer relationships and customer retention 
any significant difficulty obtaining voice messaging equipment could lead to interruption in service and loss of customers and revenue  and technological obsolescence of our voice messaging equipment could result in substantial capital expenditures 
we do not manufacture voice messaging equipment used at our voice messaging service centers  and this equipment is currently available from a limited number of sources 
although we have not historically experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment required for our operations and believe that viable alternative suppliers exist  shortages may arise in the future or alternative suppliers may not be available 
our inability to obtain voice messaging equipment in the future could result in delays or reduced delivery of messages  which could lead to a loss of customers and revenue 
in addition  technological advances may result in the development of new voice messaging equipment and changing industry standards  which could cause our voice messaging equipment to become obsolete 
these events could require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our voice messaging equipment 
returned transactions or thefts of services could lead to a loss of revenue  and could adversely effect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we do business 
if our internal controls  risk management practices and bad debt reserve practices are not adequate  returned transactions  unauthorized transactions or thefts of services could lead to a loss of revenue  and could adversely effect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we do business 
we use two principal financial payment clearance systems in connection with our enhanced calling services the federal reserve s automated clearing house for electronic fund transfers  and the national credit card systems for electronic credit card settlement 
in our use of these established payment clearance systems  we generally bear credit risks similar to those normally assumed by other users of these systems arising from returned transactions caused by insufficient funds  stop payment orders  closed accounts  frozen accounts  unauthorized use  disputes  theft or fraud 
we could experience material revenue losses due to these types of returned transactions 
from time to time  persons have gained unauthorized access to our network and obtained services without rendering payment to us by unlawfully using the access numbers and personal identification numbers of authorized users 
in addition  in connection with our wholesale prepaid telephone card relationships  we have experienced unauthorized activation of prepaid telephone cards 
we could experience material revenue losses due to unauthorized use of access numbers and personal identification numbers  unauthorized activation of prepaid calling cards  activation of prepaid calling cards in excess of the prepaid amount  or theft of prepaid calling cards 
we attempt to manage these risks through our internal controls and proprietary billing systems 
we attempt to prohibit a single access number and personal identification number from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to our telecommunications equipment  and generally we establish preset spending limits for each subscriber 
we also maintain reserves for these risks 
however  past experience in estimating and establishing reserves and our historical losses are not necessarily accurate indicators of future losses or the adequacy of the reserves we may establish in the future 
our debt could harm our liquidity and our ability to obtain additional financing  and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
in  we incurred million in indebtedness by issuing convertible notes to the public 
we have significant interest payment obligations as result of these convertible notes 
our debt could inhibit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our debt could also harm our liquidity  because a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures and forego potential acquisitions and investments to be able to meet these debt repayment requirements 
an increase in the rate of amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets or future write downs could cause our financial performance to suffer in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets reflected on our financial statements 
we are amortizing the goodwill and other intangibles over a range of periods we believe appropriate for the assets 
if the amortization period for any of these assets is accelerated due to a reevaluation of the useful life of these assets or for any other reason  amortization expense may initially increase on a quarterly basis or require a write down of the goodwill or other intangible assets  which could cause our financial performance to suffer in future quarters 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law may inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our shareholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of premiere by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of premiere because only one third of the board is up for election each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the georgia business corporation code that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 
in addition to considering the effects of any action on us and our shareholders  our articles of incorporation permit our board of directors and the committees and individual members of the board to consider the interests of various constituencies  including employees  customers  suppliers  and creditors  communities in which we maintain offices or operations  and other factors which they deem pertinent  in carrying out and discharging their duties and responsibilities and in determining what is believed to be our best interests 
our rights plan may also inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
in june  our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series c junior participating preferred stock at a price of sixty dollars per one thousandth of a series c preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights may have anti takeover effects because they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
however  the rights should not interfere with any merger  statutory share exchange or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights may be terminated by the board of directors at any time on or prior to the close of business ten business days after announcement by us that a person has become an acquiring person 
the rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of us to initiate an acquisition through negotiations with the board of directors 
however  the effect of the rights may be to discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial equity position in the equity securities of  or seeking to obtain control of  us 
risks related to past acquisitions if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize sufficient cost savings and economies of scale 
we are continuing to integrate the operations of several businesses acquired in and by attempting to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary costs 
the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses into our operations is critical to our future performance 
if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses with our operations on schedule or at all  these acquisitions may not result in sufficient cost savings or economies of scale and operational synergies may not develop 
potential challenges to the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses include 
consolidation of service centers and work forces  
elimination of unnecessary costs  and 
integration and retention of new personnel 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
we are continuing to integrate previously acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems with ours 
we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty integrating incompatible systems of acquired businesses into our networks 
as a result  our integration plans may materially change in the future 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
challenges to the successful integration of acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems include 
localization of our products and services  
integration of technologies  telecommunications equipment and networks  
cross selling of products and services to our customer base and customer bases of acquired businesses  and 
compliance with regulatory requirements 
if we do not properly manage the growth we have experienced through acquisitions  our administrative  technical and financial resources may be strained  which could cause the quality of our products and services to suffer 
we have experienced substantial growth in revenue and personnel in recent years  particularly in and early  a substantial portion of which has been accomplished through our acquisitions of voice tel enterprises  inc and its related entities and franchisees  voicecom systems  inc  xpedite systems  inc and american teleconferencing services ltd 
our growth through acquisitions has placed significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our administrative  technical  and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion may further strain our administrative  technical  financial  management and other resources 
our systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
if we are unable to do this  then the quality of our services may suffer  which will make it difficult to grow or maintain our market share in the markets in which we compete 
risks related to possible future acquisitions we intend to pursue future acquisitions and we may face risks in acquiring and integrating other businesses  products and technologies 
we intend to pursue future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that we believe will complement our business 
as a result  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to the company and investors  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  
the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  
entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  
potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  
the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  and 
adverse financial impact from the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we fail to assimilate and retain key employees of future businesses we acquire  it could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
assimilation and retention of the key employees of an acquired company are generally important to the success of an acquisition 
if we fail to assimilate and retain any key employees of any business we acquire  the acquisition may not result in revenue growth  operational synergies or product and service enhancements  which could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
future acquisitions may involve restructuring and other special charges  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
we have taken  and in the future may take  charges in connection with acquisitions  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
in addition  the costs and expenses incurred may exceed the estimates upon which these charges are based 
during the second quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voice tel 
during the third quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voicecom 
we also recorded restructuring and other special charges before income taxes of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of xpedite 
risks related to intellectual property we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology  brand and marks 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary rights and technology  we could lose those rights and incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights 
our proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets that we attempt to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in our licensing  services  reseller and other agreements 
we typically attempt to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
our means of protecting our intellectual property  proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us furthermore  some of our systems  such as those used in our document distribution business are not proprietary and  as a result  this information may be acquired or duplicated by existing and potential competitors 
if claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and successfully prosecuted against us  it could result in the substantial costs 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information services and telecommunications  computer telephony  the internet and unified messaging  which allows a person to access all of their messaging devices from a computer or telephone 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of our business  we have been and expect to continue to be  subject to third party claims that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement may be brought against us with respect to current or future products or services 
if these types of actions or claims are brought we may not ultimately prevail and any claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of these types of claims 
any infringements claims  whether with or without merit  could 
be time consuming and a diversion to management  
result in costly litigation  
cause delays in introducing new products and services or enhancements  
result in costly royalty or licensing agreements  or 
cause us to discontinue use of the challenged technology  tradename or service mark at potentially significant expense associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology 
for detailed descriptions of our prior and current infringement claims  see item business proprietary rights and technology 
risks related to pending litigation our pending litigation could be costly  time consuming and a diversion to management and  if adversely determined  could result in the loss of rights or substantial liabilities for damages 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation from third parties  including allegations that our products and services infringe the patents  trademarks and copyrights of these third parties 
we have several litigation matters pending  which we are defending vigorously 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the litigation process and the judicial system  we cannot predict the outcome of these litigation matters 
regardless of the outcome  these litigation matters could be costly  time consuming and a diversion of management and other resources 
if the outcome of one or more of these matters is adverse to us  it could result in a loss of material rights or substantial liabilities for damages 
for detailed descriptions of our material pending litigation  see item legal proceedings 
our pending shareholder litigation in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia could be costly  time consuming and a diversion to management and  if adversely determined  could result in substantial liabilities 
we and some of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in multiple shareholder class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
plaintiffs seek to represent a class of individuals including a subclass of former voice tel franchisees and a subclass of former xpedite shareholders who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between february  through june  plaintiffs allege  among other things  violation of sections b  a and a of the securities exchange act of and sections  and of the securities act of we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on april  on december   the court issued an order that dismissed the claims under section b and of the exchange act without prejudice  and dismissed the claims under section a of the securities act with prejudice 
the effect of this order was to dismiss from this lawsuit all open market purchases by the plaintiffs 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on february   which we intend to move to dismiss

risks related to government regulation us or other government regulations and legal uncertainties related to the internet may place financial burdens on our business related to compliance 
currently  there are few laws or regulations directed specifically at electronic commerce and the internet 
however  because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as collection and use of data from web site visitors and related privacy issues  pricing  content  copyrights  on line gambling  distribution and quality of goods and services 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet  which could impede the growth of our web enabled products and services and place additional financial burdens on our business in order to comply with new laws and regulations 
laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce or internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
for example  the united states congress recently enacted laws regarding on line copyright infringement and the protection of information collected on line from children 
although these laws may not have a direct adverse effect on our business  they add to the legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the internet and possible future costs of regulatory compliance 
our failure to comply with various government regulations related to long distance and operator service could impair our ability to deliver our products and services 
premiere communications  inc  our operating subsidiary that provides regulated long distance telecommunications and operator services  is subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions  and is affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by these agencies 
various international authorities may also seek to regulate the long distance and operator services provided by premiere communications 
if premiere communications fails to comply with these various government regulations  we could be prohibited from providing these services and we might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
interstate and international long distance 
premiere communications has made the requisite filings with the fcc to provide interstate and international long distance services 
as a condition of providing these types of services  premiere communications must comply with various fcc requirements  including  
tariff requirements  
reporting obligations  
payment of regulatory assessments in connection with programs like universal service  telecommunications relay service and payphone compensation  and 
submission to the fcc s jurisdiction for resolution of complaints 
intrastate long distance 
in order to provide intrastate long distance service  premiere communications generally is required to obtain certification from state public utility commissions  to register with these commissions or to be found exempt from this registration 
premiere communications is currently authorized to provide long distance telecommunications services in states and in the district of columbia  and is seeking authorization to provide long distance telecommunications services in the four other states 
in addition  as a condition of providing intrastate long distance services  premiere communications generally is required to 
comply with public utility commission tariff requirements  reporting obligations and regulatory assessments  and 
submit to public utility commission jurisdiction over complaints  transfers of control and financing transactions 
operator service 
with the exception of three states  colorado  michigan and arizona  in which its applications to provide operator service ie  are pending  premiere communications is authorized to provide operator service in each state where it provides long distance telecommunications service 
premiere communications uses reasonable efforts to ensure that its operations comply with these regulatory requirements 
however  premiere communications may not be currently in compliance with all fcc and state regulatory requirements 
furthermore  premiere communications facilities do not prevent its customers from making long distance calls in any state  including states in which it currently is not authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services and operator services 
premiere communications provision of long distance telecommunications and operator services in states where it is not in compliance with public utility commission requirements could result in prohibitions on providing long distance service and subject us to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
we may become subject to new laws and regulations involving services and transactions in the areas of electronic commerce  which could increase costs of compliance 
in conducting our business  we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code  and we are also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
congress has held hearings regarding  and various agencies are considering  whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
for example  the federal reserve completed a study  directed by congress  regarding the propriety of applying regulation e to stored value cards 
the department of treasury has promulgated proposed rules applying record keeping  reporting and other requirements to a wide variety of entities involved in electronic commerce 
it is possible that congress  the states or various government agencies could impose new or additional requirements on the electronic commerce market or entities operating therein 
if enacted  these laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on our business and industry and could result in substantial compliance costs 
risks related to international operations and expansion our future success depends on our expansion into international markets and revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of expansion 
a component of our strategy is our planned expansion into international markets 
revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of establishing and expanding these international operations 
we currently deliver document distribution services worldwide 
we also operate voice and data messaging service centers in canada  australia  new zealand  puerto rico  the united kingdom  italy  japan  hong kong  taiwan and south korea 
in addition  we have conferencing operations in canada and australia 
while we have significant international experience in the delivery of our document distribution services  we have only limited experience in marketing and distributing our conferencing services  voice and data messaging services  and unified messaging services internationally 
accordingly  we may not be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our voice and data messaging  conferencing and unified messaging services in the new international markets 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could hinder our international growth strategy 
our ability to achieve future success will depend in part on the expansion of our international operations

burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  
export restrictions and controls relating to technology  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
longer payment cycles  
problems in collecting accounts receivable  
political and economic instability  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
we could experience losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we conduct business outside the us and some of our expenses and revenue are derived in foreign currencies 
in particular  a significant portion of our document distribution business is conducted outside the us and a significant portion of our revenue and expenses from that business are derived in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we could experience material losses due to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we have not experienced any material losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  but we could in the future 
we typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currency and have not regularly engaged in hedging transactions  although we may engage in hedging transactions from time to time in the future
