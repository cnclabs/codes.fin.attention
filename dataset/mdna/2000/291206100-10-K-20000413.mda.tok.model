the following information is provided for the years ending december  and working capital   long term debt to equity cash provided by operations   cash and short term investments available    and  loan on office building listed as current liability in and after impairment  management believes that the carrying value of producing oil and gas properties is not in excess of the fair value 
carrying value of producing properties  net of depletion and depreciation  is  oil and gas revenues  net of expenses  were  for the year before depreciation  depletion  and impairment 
as many of the company s producing properties are natural gas properties  with lives in excess of twenty five years  we believe the carrying value is fully recoverable 
in addition  the company has carrying value of  on non producing properties  which is net of an allowance for impairment of  management believes  since the majority of the non producing properties are mineral interests  the allowance is adequate and the remaining costs in the assets will be recovered 
management knows of no environmental assessment problems or of the potential of any such environmental assessment 
all purchased real estate had environmental studies performed prior to purchase and our environmental laboratory has been instructed on the appropriate procedures for disposal of various kinds of wastes although relatively insignificant in amount

results of operations environmental revenues increased to  in from  in and  in  demonstrating a increase from and a increase above these increases were the result of the company acquiring several large clients in and while maintaining the company s regular clients 
environmental expenses increased from  in to  in  a increase 
this increase was the result of increased costs due to increased work 
environmental expenses increased by  from to this was also the result of increased work 
below is a table illustrating net revenues and operating expenses for the company s environmental industry sales    operating expenses    oil and gas sales declined from  in to  in this was a decline between and this decline was the result of declining production largely caused by operator s shutting in oil and gas wells due to low oil and gas prices for most of the years of and oil and gas sales declined from  in to  in this was a decline 
this decline from to was the result of falling prices in and flush production from three wells drilled in late  benefitting sales 
oil and gas expenses decreased from  in to  in  a decrease 
this was the result of fewer wells being operated due to low oil and gas prices 
oil and gas expenses also decreased from  in to  in this decline was largely due to less maintenance being performed due to lower prices received for oil during below is a table showing revenues and operating expenses per year for the company s oil and gas industry sales    operating expenses    depreciation  depletion and amortization were  in compared to  in this was a increase caused by a one time write off of  of oil and gas properties in the first quarter of see note write down of impaired oil and gas properties 
the company decided due to low prices and declining production the properties were not worth the carrying value on the books 
other than this write down depreciation  depletion  and amortization was fairly stable for the two years 
depreciation  depletion and amortization was  in compared to  in this decrease from to was a result of a decline in production from prior years in the brundage canyon field and the sale of the buildings located at wn road in natrona county  wyoming 
general and administrative costs decreased from  in to  in  this decrease was caused by certain cost cutting activities such as the company decreasing staff and the costs related to those employees 
general and administrative costs declined from  in to  in  which was also the result of cuts in employees and their related expenses 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in this decrease was the result of lower borrowing base for most of the year and low interest rates on most of the company s loans 
also decreasing interest expense in was the sale of the company s properties on wn road in natrona county  wyoming and no longer having the associated notes payable on these properties in interest expense was approximately the same for years and interest income was  in compared to  in the interest income was aided by a one time collection of interest on royalties that were not paid in the period allowed  otherwise interest income would have been the same 
interest income for compared to was  higher 
this as noted above in  was the result of interest collected on royalties not paid in the period allowed 
overall  total revenues increased by during  because of acquiring several large contracts in the environmental testing and management industry 
this increase more than compensated for the decline in oil and gas prices and production 
total operating expenses increased by  primarily the result of higher costs in the environmental testing and management industry  which more than offset declines in general and administrative costs and lower costs in the oil and gas industry 
year compliance year compliance is the ability of computer hardware and software to respond to the problems posed by the fact that computer programs traditionally have used two digits rather than four digits to define an applicable year 
as a consequence  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing interruption of operations  including temporary inability to perform accounting functions and delays in the receipt of payments from purchasers of oil and gas production and environmental testing customers 
the company identified and is in the process of correcting applications 
new software systems were fully operational in december we are also working with our vendors and suppliers to assess their compliance 
costs to modify such applications remains immaterial to our results of operations or financial condition 
letters have been accumulated from significant customers regarding year compliance 
assurance letters have also been received from all financial institutions 
the relationships with third parties has been evaluated based on assurances presented 
failure of customers to be year compliant may lead to delays in payments and lost revenue to the company 
although the company believes its major customers are year complaint  there is no assurance that this is the case 
in the event of disruptions caused by failure of customers to be year compliant  the company believes there will be alternative purchases of the company s production and the environmental testing services and the customer base is diversified over enough customers to avoid company hardship 
no problems have been encountered as a result of year
