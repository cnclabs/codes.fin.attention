crescent is affiliated with the company through common ownership and management 
this decrease will likely be partially offset by crescent s payments to the company of fees related to the company s guaranty of crescent s obligations under crescent s credit facility

for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was favorably impacted by improved earnings and lower net inventory levels including accounts payable  offset slightly by an increase in customer accounts receivable 
to the extent that the company continues to expand rapidly  it will continue to experience significant increases in credit sales and related increases in customer accounts as well as increases in inventories  which will likely result in a net use of cash from operations 
investing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to cash provided of million in fiscal and cash used of million in fiscal the company added net new stores in fiscal at a cost of approximately million and invested million in store re modeling and store relocations 
in addition  the company invested million in store displays to support its new merchandising programs and initiatives and million on the implementation of the company s e commerce web site

during fiscal and  the company had bank repayments of million and bank borrowings of million  respectively 
at september   the company had million available under its million senior secured revolving credit facility 
on september   the company entered into a three year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate or  at the company s option  the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin is determined based on a calculation of the combined leverage ratio of the company and crescent 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by certain of the company s assets 
the company used the proceeds from the credit facility together  with the proceeds from the repayment of its million investment in crescent  to repay in full all of its obligations under its then existing credit facilities 
at september   million was outstanding under the facility  with interest accruing on such borrowings in a range from to 
in connection with the credit facility  the company agreed to provide certain credit enhancements and to guaranty the obligations of crescent under its million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in consideration for this guaranty  crescent makes quarterly payments to the company in an amount equal to per annum of the outstanding obligations of crescent under its credit facility during the preceding fiscal quarter 
in further consideration of this guaranty  crescent issued the company a warrant to purchase  shares of crescent s non voting class a common stock  or approximately of the capital stock of crescent on a fully diluted basis  for an exercise price of  the company s current plans are to have between and stores in operation for the christmas season 
the capital required to fund this expansion  principally to finance inventory  fixtures and leasehold improvements  is estimated to be million and is intended to be provided by cash flow from operations and the company s revolving credit facility 
seasonality the company has in the past experienced a well defined seasonality in its business with respect to both net sales and profitability 
generally  the company experiences substantially increased sales volume in the days preceding major holidays  including christmas  valentine s day and mother s day 
due to the impact of the christmas shopping season  the company experiences the strongest results of operations in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
if for any reason the company s sales were below those normally expected for the first quarter  the company s annual results could be materially adversely affected 
the seasonality of the company s business puts a significant demand on working capital resources to provide for an inventory buildup for the christmas season 
furthermore  the christmas season typically leads to a seasonal buildup of customer receivables that are paid down during subsequent months 
however  to the extent that the company s expansion program continues  it can be expected that increased levels of accounts receivable related to such expansion may affect the historical seasonal decline in customer receivables 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy and relative stability in the prices of diamonds  gemstones and gold 
substantially all of the leases for the company s retail stores located in malls provide for contingent or volume related rental increases 
in prior years  the company has been able to adjust its selling prices to substantially recover increased costs 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
new accounting standards the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas on october  fas provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
the company does not employ any derivative instruments and  therefore  statement did not have an effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
sab 
this bulletin provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
this bulletin will be effective in fiscal the company expects the adoption of sab will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future performance our growth may place a strain on our resources and may affect adversely the results of our operations 
the number of stores we operate has increased greatly during the past three years 
for example  we opened approximately net new stores from january to december we intend to continue to expand our store base during fiscal the success of our expansion program will depend on the performance of our existing stores  our ability to find suitable store locations and our ability to hire and train qualified store personnel 
we anticipate that there will continue to be significant competition among specialty retailers for desirable store sites and qualified personnel 
furthermore  if our operations fail to generate sufficient cash flow  we may require additional capital to finance our planned expansion 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our management information and distribution systems and personnel 
for these reasons  we may not be successful in continuing our growth or successfully managing our growth which could result in a reduction in our historical revenue growth or an increase in cost of goods sold which would directly and adversely affect our earnings

our industry is highly competitive  and we may fall behind our competitors 
the retail jewelry business is mature and highly competitive 
our retail jewelry business competes with national and regional jewelry chains  as well as with local independently owned jewelry stores and chains 
we also compete with other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  catalog showrooms  discounters  direct mail suppliers  television home shopping networks and jewelry retailers who make sales through internet sites 
our credit operations compete with credit card companies and other providers of consumer credit 
management believes that friedman s competes primarily on the basis of selection of merchandise offered  pricing  quality of sales personnel  advertising  ability to offer in house credit  store location and reputation 
many competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully with such competitors 
competition could cause us to lose customers  increase expenditures or reduce pricing which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
see item business competition 
our results of operations may be significantly affected by a downturn in general economic conditions 
jewelry is a luxury item  not a necessity product 
as a result  sales of jewelry may be particularly affected by adverse trends in the general economy  such as decreases in employment levels  wages and salaries 
historically  people spend less money on luxury items  such as jewelry  during a decline in general economic activity 
sales of our jewelry are also adversely affected by negative developments in local economic conditions  such as plant closings  industry slowdown and government employment cutbacks 
we also depend on customer traffic at the power strip centers and malls where our stores are located 
a reduction in consumer spending due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our net sales 
a majority of our customers use credit either from us or another consumer credit source to purchase jewelry from us 
when there are adverse trends in the general economy or increases in interest rates  fewer people use credit 
our credit operations are also affected by general economic trends 
any downturn in general or local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our ability to collect outstanding credit accounts receivable 
see item selected financial data and item business credit operations 
our business is highly seasonal  which may cause significant fluctuations in our results 
our first fiscal quarter  which ends december  has historically been the strongest quarter of the year in terms of net sales and operating income 
any substantial disruption of holiday season shopping or other events which affect our first quarter results could have a material adverse effect on our profitability for the whole year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following 
the timing of new store openings  
net sales contributed by new stores  
actions of competitors  
fluctuations in comparable store sales  
timing of certain holidays  
changes in our merchandise  and 
general economic  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
the loss of our president and chief executive officer or other key personnel could significantly harm our business 
our management and operations depend on the skills and experience of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  bradley j 
stinn 
we believe that our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies depends on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the loss of mr 
stinn or a significant number of other senior officers could hurt us materially 
we do not have and do not contemplate entering into employment agreements with  or obtaining key man life insurance for  any senior officer 
we may incur additional compensation expense because of our incentive compensation arrangements 
in october  we made million in incentive loans to each of mr 
stinn and sterling b 
brinkley  our chairman of the board of directors 
the loans mature in we agreed to forgive principal and interest payments on these incentive loans if our class a common stock reached certain prices 
if we forgive principal and interest payments  we will incur compensation expense which reduces earnings 
during and  we incurred compensation expense of million with respect to the incentive loans 
if the price of the class a common stock increases above the remaining price targets  we will incur an additional million in compensation expense 
this compensation expense  if incurred  will negatively impact earnings 
we may not be able to maintain the growth of comparable store sales 
one widely used measure of the performance of a retail company like us is comparable store sales results 
variations in comparable store sales results could cause the price of the class a common stock to decrease or fluctuate substantially 
comparable store sales are affected by a variety of factors including 
local and general economic conditions  
the retail sales environment  and 
our ability to execute our business strategy effectively 
comparable store net merchandise sales increased in fiscal there can be no assurance that comparable store net merchandise sales will increase in any future period 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in the availability and prices of our merchandise may affect our results of operations 
we primarily sell jewelry made of gold and diamonds and  to a lesser extent  other precious and semi precious metals and stones 
the prices of these materials have been  and we expect for them to continue to be  subject to significant volatility 
further  the supply and price of diamonds are significantly influenced by a single entity  debeers consolidated mines ltd 
of south africa 
we do not maintain long term inventories or otherwise hedge against fluctuations in the cost of gold or diamonds 
a significant increase in the price of gold and diamonds could adversely affect our sales and gross margins 
see item business purchasing 
our supply of diamonds comes primarily from south africa  botswana  zaire  the former soviet republics and australia 
changes in the social  political or economic conditions in one or more of these countries could have an adverse effect on our supply of diamonds 
any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds from these producing countries could adversely affect our product costs  and as a result  our earnings

your stock value may be adversely affected because of the concentrated ownership of our class b common stock 
mr 
phillip e 
cohen controls all of our class b common stock through his ownership of ms jewelers  the general partner of the partnership which owns the class b common stock 
the holders of class b common stock have the right to elect of our directors and control the outcome of all other issues decided by our stockholders  including major corporate transactions 
mr 
cohen can transfer the class b common stock and its voting rights to a third party  subject to certain limitations 
if mr 
cohen were to convert the class b common stock into class a common stock  he would control approximately of the class a common stock 
your stock value may be adversely affected because only holders of class b common stock may vote on corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
holders of class a common stock have the right to elect a minimum of of our directors 
as long as there are shares of class b common stock outstanding  holders of class a common stock have no other voting rights  except as required by law 
mr 
cohen controls the outcome of substantially all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
some potential investors may not like this concentration of control and the price of class a common stock may be adversely affected 
mr 
cohen s control of friedman s may also discourage offers by third parties to buy us or to merge with us 
further  the interests of mr 
cohen could conflict with the interests of the holders of class a common stock 
our business may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations governing our business 
federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit and insurance 
any adverse change in the regulation of credit could adversely affect our net sales and cost of goods sold 
for example  new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we could charge on consumer loan accounts  or restrict our ability to collect on account balances 
compliance with  or any violation of  existing and future laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely effect our business or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the company pays interest on borrowings at either the federal funds rate plus  the prime rate or  at the company s option  the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin ranging from to 
if the interest rates on the company s borrowings average basis points more in fiscal than they did in fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase and income before income taxes would decrease by  this amount is determined solely by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in the interest rate on the company s borrowing cost without consideration for other factors such as actions management might take to mitigate its exposure to interest rate changes
