this entire annual report should be read to put such forward looking statements in context and to gain a more complete understanding of the uncertainties and risks involved in the company s business 
business organization central coast bancorp the company is a california corporation  located in salinas  california and was organized in to act as a bank holding company for bank of salinas 
in  the company acquired cypress bank  which was headquartered in seaside  california 
both banks were state charted institutions

as of december   the bank operated eight full service branch offices and one limited service branch office in monterey county  california 
the bank is headquartered in salinas and serves individuals  merchants  small and medium sized businesses  professionals  agribusiness enterprises and wage earners located in the salinas valley and the monterey peninsula 
on february   the former bank of salinas purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the gonzales and castroville branch offices of wells fargo bank 
as a result of the transaction  the bank assumed deposit liabilities  received cash  and acquired tangible assets 
this transaction resulted in intangible assets  representing the excess of the liabilities assumed over the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
in january  the former cypress bank opened a new branch office in monterey  california  so that it might better serve business and individual customers on the monterey peninsula 
in december  the former bank of salinas opened an additional new branch office in salinas  california  to better provide services to the growing salinas community 
other than holding the shares of the subsidiary bank  the company conducts no significant activities 
although  it is authorized  with the prior approval of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the board of governors  the company s principal regulator  to engage in a variety of activities which are deemed closely related to the business of banking 
the following analysis is designed to enhance the reader s understanding of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations as reported in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
reference should be made to those statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report for additional detailed information

we believe this strategy will provide continued growth and the ability to achieve above average returns for our shareholders 
a results of operations net interest income net interest margin net interest income represents the excess of interest and fees earned on interest earning assets loans  securities and federal funds sold over the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest income fully taxable equivalent for was  a  increase over the interest income component was up  to  
most of the increase was attributable to growth in the earning assets 
average outstanding loan balances of  for reflected a increase over balances 
this increase contributed an additional  to interest income 
however  due to lower rates in the first half of the year and competitive pressures  the average yield was down basis points  which offset the increase by  as a result of the federal reserve bank s actions  there have been three basis point increases in the bank s base lending rate from august  through february  these increases will favorably impact interest income going forward 
the securities portfolio average balances grew  which added  to interest income 
the average yield received on securities was up basis points and added  to interest income 
federal funds sold interest income decreased  as the average balances decreased  federal funds were repositioned into securities and loans during interest expense increased  in over the average balances of interest bearing liabilities increased  
the higher balances were due to internal growth of deposits   of average borrowings including federal funds purchased and approximately  in average balances of state of california certificates of deposit 
interest expense attributable to the higher volume was  rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities were basis points lower in than in the lower rates offset the higher expense by  net interest margin for was versus in net interest income for totaled  and was up  over average earning assets were  in for an increase of  over this year over year change was mostly the result of internal growth

provision for loan losses the bank provided  for loan losses in of that amount   compensated for the  loan growth during the year 
net loans charged off in totaled only  or 
of average loans outstanding 
in  net loans charged off totaled  or 
of average loans outstanding 
consequently  the company made provisions for loan losses of only  in  the company provided  service charges and fees and other income noninterest income was up  to  in from the level 
service charges and fees related to deposit accounts made up  of the increase 
several new fees were implemented late in the year 
these new fees added about  of the increase 
the remainder was due to higher volumes 
other income increased only  from the level 
this change reflected some good growth in certain service fees that was offset in part by lower mortgage origination fees due to the higher mortgage interest rates and reduced up charges on bank supplied check stock 
for  noninterest income was up  from results to  service charges and fees related to deposit accounts accounted for  of the increase 
the growth came from both higher volumes and some selective fee increases 
other income was up  to  over results 
mortgage origination fees accounted for  of that increase as mortgage activity was significantly higher in salaries and benefits for  increases in salaries and benefits totaled  
base salaries increased  due to normal merit reviews  additional months of operations for the westridge branch and staffing additions during the year 
benefit costs increased commensurate with the salaries 
at the end of  the full time equivalent fte staff was versus at the end of salary and benefits expenses increased  to  in from the level in components of salaries and benefits that increased significantly included  base salary and wages   and benefits including employer taxes  part of the higher expense was attributable to the full year effect in of the two branch offices purchasedfrom wells fargo bank in late february and the december opening of the new westridge branch office in salinas 
additional staff was added company wide due to growth 
the full time equivalent fte staff was up from at the end of occupancy and furniture and equipment occupancy and fixed assets expense increased  in much of the increase is attributable to the remodeling of two branch offices and operations office space during the year as well as the full year of westridge operations and upgrades to the mis systems and computer network 
additional costs were incurred for an outside security service during the last quarter as the bank increased its vault cash in preparation for yk 
premises and fixed asset related expenses were  in this was an increase of  over during  the company installed a wide area network  a year compliant central computer and software system and upgraded many of its computer workstations 
these enhancements provide the platform for growth  but contributed significantly to the increase in premises and fixed asset expenses 
there were other significant increases in repairs and maintenance of equipment  janitorial and gardening and rent on leased quarters 
other expenses in  other expenses increased  
these include one time costs of approximately  associated with merging the bank of salinas and cypress bank to form the bank 
also in  the bank recorded a  expense to write down its former gonzales branch office building to estimated net realizable value 
normal price increases and growth in the bank s operations accounted for the remaining higher expenses 
the overhead efficiency ratio  calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income  for was as compared to in other expenses increased  to  in atm expense was up  as the bank added more locations and changed the service provider 
promotional expenses were up  as the bank increased its advertising campaign 
consulting costs rose  as the bank contracted for a special project 
those three categories saw the largest changes from the prior year 
the overhead efficiency ratio for was 
provision for taxes the effective tax rate on income was   and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of the company in was reduced from the prior year as a result of investments made in tax qualified municipal bonds 
the effective tax rate was greater than the federal statutory tax rate due to state tax expense of   and  in these years 
tax exempt income of   and  from investment securities and loans in these years helped to reduce the effective tax rate 
b balance sheet analysis central coast bancorp s total assets at december  were  compared to  at december   representing an increase of 
the average balances of total assets of  in represent an increase of  or over  in loans the bank concentrates its lending activities in four principal areas commercial loans including agricultural loans  installment loans  real estate construction loans both commercial and personal and real estate other loans 
at december   these four categories accounted for approximately   and of the bank s loan portfolio  respectively  as compared to   and at december  continuing strong economic activity in the bank s market area coupled with lower interest rates early in resulted in some shifting loan demands during while all loan categories reflect year over year growth from to  the largest growth took place in the real estate other category 
however  the largest percentage gain of was in the real estate construction category 
table three summarizes the composition of the loan portfolio for the past five years as of december table three loan portfolio composite in thousands commercial      real estate construction      other      installment      deferred loans fees total loans      allowance for loan losses      total      the majority of the bank s loans are direct loans made to individuals  local businesses and agri businesses 
the bank relies substantially on local promotional activity  personal contacts by bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the bank makes loans to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose  a viable repayment source and a plan of repayment established at inception and generally backed by a secondary source of repayment 
commercial loans consist of credit lines for operating needs  loans for equipment purchases  working capital  and various other business loan products 
installment loans include a range of traditional consumer loan products offered by the bank such as personal lines of credit and loans to finance purchases of autos  boats  recreational vehicles  mobile homes and various other consumer items 
the construction loans are generally composed of commitments to customers within the bank s service area for construction of both commercial properties and custom and semi custom single family residences 
other real estate loans consist primarily of loans to the bank s depositors secured by first trust deeds on commercial and residential properties typically with short term maturities and original loan to value ratios not exceeding 
in general  except in the case of loans with sba guarantees  the bank does not make long term mortgage loans  however  the bank has informal arrangements in place with mortgage lenders to assist customers in securing single family mortgage financing 
average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over the favorable economic conditions and lower interest rates provided the impetus for continuing loan growth 
average net loans in were  representing an increase of  or over risk elements the bank assesses and manages credit risk on an ongoing basis through stringent credit review and approval policies  extensive internal monitoring and established formal lending policies 
additionally  the bank contracts with an outside loan review consultant to periodically grade new loans and to review the existing loan portfolio 
management believes its ability to identify and assess risk and return characteristics of the company s loan portfolio is critical for profitability and growth 
management strives to continue the historically low level of credit losses by continuing its emphasis on credit quality in the loan approval process  active credit administration and regular monitoring 
with this in mind  management has designed and implemented a comprehensive loan review and grading system that functions to continually assess the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
ultimately  credit quality may be influenced by underlying trends in the economic and business cycles 
the bank s business is concentrated in monterey county  california whose economy is highly dependent on the agricultural industry 
as a result  the bank lends money to individuals and companies dependent upon the agricultural industry 
in addition  the bank has significant extensions of credit and commitments to extend credit which are secured by real estate  totaling approximately million at december  the ultimate recovery of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation  sale or refinancing of the real estate 
the bank monitors the effects of current and expected market conditions and other factors on the collectability of real estate loans 
when  in management s judgement  these loans are impaired  an appropriate provision for losses is recorded 
the more significant assumptions management considers involve estimates of the following lease  absorption and sale rates  real estate values and rates of return  operating expenses  inflation  and sufficiency of collateral independent of the real estate including  in limited instances  personal guarantees 
in extending credit and commitments to borrowers  the bank generally requires collateral and or guarantees as security 
the repayment of such loans is expected to come from cash flow or from proceeds from the sale of selected assets of the borrowers 
the bank s requirement for collateral and or guarantees is determined on a case by case basis in connection with management s evaluation of the credit worthiness of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing properties  residences and other real property 
the bank secures its collateral by perfecting its interest in business assets  obtaining deeds of trust  or outright possession among other means 
loan losses from lending transactions related to real estate and agriculture compare favorably with the bank s loan losses on its loan portfolio as a whole 
management believes that its lending policies and underwriting standards will tend to minimize losses in an economic downturn  however  there is no assurance that losses will not occur under such circumstances 
the bank s loan policies and underwriting standards include  but are not limited to  the following maintaining a thorough understanding of the bank s service area and limiting investments outside of this area  maintaining a thorough understanding of borrowers knowledge and capacity in their field of expertise  basing real estate construction loan approval not only on salability of the project  but also on the borrowers capacity to support the project financially in the event it does not sell within the original projected time period  and maintaining conforming and prudent loan to value and loan to cost ratios based on independent outside appraisals and ongoing inspection and analysis by the bank s construction lending officers 
in addition  the bank strives to diversify the risk inherent in the construction portfolio by avoiding concentrations to individual borrowers and on any one project 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
loans are charged off when  in the opinion of management  collection appears unlikely 
table four sets forth nonaccrual loans and loans past due days or more for december table four non performing loans in thousands past due days or more and still accruing commercial real estate  consumer and other nonaccrual commercial real estate  consumer and other total nonperforming loans   interest due but excluded from interest income on nonaccrual loans was approximately  in   in and  in in  and interest income recognized from payments received on nonaccrual loans was   and  respectively 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that are considered impaired was  of which  is included in nonaccrual loans above 
such impaired loans had a valuation allowance of  the average recorded investment in impaired loans during was  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of   and  in  and  respectively 
there were no troubled debt restructurings or loan concentrations in excess of of total loans not otherwise disclosed as a category of loans as of december  management is not aware of any potential problem loans  which were accruing and current at december   where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms 
the company held no real estate acquired by foreclosure at december  or allowance for loan losses activity the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loans outstanding 
this allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
management determines an appropriate provision based upon the interaction of three primary factors the loan portfolio growth in the period  a comprehensive grading and review formula for total loans outstanding  and actual previous charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans at december  compared to  or at december  and  or at december  the loan growth of  in  necessitated an increase of  in the allowance for loan loses to maintain the percentage at the level 
because of the generally strong economic environment  it was not necessary to significantly increase the allowance percentage above the level 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for known and future risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss potential  including economic factors  overall credit quality  historical delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss provision and allowance is prudent and adequate 
however  no prediction of the ultimate level of loans charged off in future years can be made with any certainty 
table five summarizes  for the years indicated  the activity in the allowance for loan losses

state of california certificates of deposit accounted for  of the deposit growth 
management believes that depressed prices in the vegetable markets played a significant role in slowing deposit growth in deposits at december  totaled  and were up  over the year end balances of  the increase in year end total deposits is attributable to internal growth in noninterest bearing demand  interest bearing demand  savings and time deposit categories 
capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
since october of and through december   the board of directors of the company has authorized the repurchase of up to of outstanding shares of the company s common stock from time to time  subject to appropriate regulatory and other accounting requirements 
the company acquired approximately  shares of its common stock in the open market during and approximately  in at an average price of approximately and per share  respectively 
these repurchases were made periodically in the open market with the intention to lessen the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet stock performance  options plans  acquisitions and other requirements 
the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or from the previous year end 
the ratio of total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was at december   compared to at december  tier risk based capital to risk adjusted assets was at december   compared to at december  table seven capital ratio as of december  tier capital total capital leverage see supervision and regulation on page and note in the financial statements included in item for more information 
inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on manufacturing  or other commercial concerns  primarily because its assets and liabilities are largely monetary 
in general  inflation primarily affects the company indirectly through its effect on market rates of interest  and thus the ability of the bank to attract loan customers 
inflation affects the growth of total assets by increasing the level of loan demand  and potentially adversely affects the company s capital adequacy because loan growth in inflationary periods can increase at rates higher than the rate that capital grows through retention of earnings which the company may generate in the future 
in addition to its effects on interest rates  inflation directly affects the company by increasing the company s operating expenses 
market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast earnings  net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  the company is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on earnings 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared quarterly using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liabilities ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
the forecast balance sheet is processed against three interest rate scenarios 
the scenarios include a basis point rising rate forecast  a flat rate forecast and a basis point falling rate forecast which take place within a one year time frame 
the net interest income is measured during the first year of the rate changes and in the year following the rate changes 
the company s net interest income  as forecast below  was modeled utilizing a forecast balance sheet projected from year end balances 
the following assumptions were used in the modeling activity earning asset growth of based on ending balances loan growth of based on ending balances investment and funds sold growth of based on ending balances deposit growth of based on ending balances balance sheet target balances were the same for all rate scenarios the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates as measured against a flat rate no change scenario 
table eight interest rate risk simulation of net interest income as of december  estimated impact on net interest income in thousands variation from flat rate scenario the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions  which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk 
the company also uses a second simulation scenario that rate shocks the balance sheet with an immediate parallel shift in interest rates of basis points 
this scenario provides estimates of the future market value of equity mve and net interest income nii 
mve measures the impact on equity due to the changes in the market values of assets and liabilities as a result of a change in interest rates 
the bank measures the volatility of these benchmarks using a twelve month time horizon 
using the december  balance sheet as the base for the simulation  the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income of a basis point change in interest rates table nine interest rate risk simulation of nii as of december  change change in nii in nii from current from current mo 
horizon month horizon in thousands bp  bp  these results indicate that the balance sheet is asset sensitive since earnings increase when interest rates rise 
the magnitude of the nii change is within the company s policy guidelines 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
gap analysis provides another measure of interest rate risk 
the company does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
it is presented here for comparative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
as reflected in table ten  at december   the cumulative gap through the one year time horizon indicates a liability sensitive position 
somewhere between one and five years the bank moves into an asset sensitive position 
this interest rate sensitivity table categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing immediately 
however  as has been observed through interest rate cycles  the deposit liabilities do not reprice immediately 
consequently  the bank s net interest income varies as though the bank is asset sensitive  ie as interest rates rise net interest income increases and vice versa 
this phenomenon is validated by the modeling as presented in tables eight and nine 
table ten interest rate sensitivity december  assets and liabilities over three which mature or reprice next day months and over one and within within and within over in thousands immediately three months one year five years five years total interest earning assets investment securities       loans  excluding nonaccrual loans and overdrafts       total       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand   savings   time certificates     other borrowings     total       interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap     december  interest rate sensitivity gap      cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      liquidity liquidity management refers to the company s ability to provide funds on an ongoing basis to meet fluctuations in deposit levels as well as the credit needs and requirements of its clients 
both assets and liabilities contribute to the company s liquidity position 
federal funds lines  short term investments and securities  and loan repayments contribute to liquidity  along with deposit increases  while loan funding and deposit withdrawals decrease liquidity 
the bank assess the likelihood of projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual client funding needs 
commitments to fund loans and outstanding standby letters of credit at december   were approximately  and  respectively 
such loans relate primarily to revolving lines of credit and other commercial loans  and to real estate construction loans 
the company s sources of liquidity consist of overnight funds sold to correspondent banks  unpledged marketable investments and loans held for sale 
on december   consolidated liquid assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total consolidated assets on december  in addition to liquid assets  the bank maintains short term lines of credit with correspondent banks 
at december   the bank had  available under these credit lines 
additionally  the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank 
at december   the bank could have arranged for up to  in secured borrowings from the fhlb 
informal agreements are also in place with various other banks to purchase participations in loans  if necessary 
the company serves primarily a business and professional customer base and  as such  its deposit base is susceptible to economic fluctuations 
accordingly  management strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
liquidity is also affected by portfolio maturities and the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the marketability of both assets and liabilities 
in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas the bank reclassified all securities into the available for sale category 
this enables the bank to sell any of its unpledged securities to meet liquidity needs 
due to the rising interest rate environment throughout the last half of  much of the investment portfolio has experienced price declines  which has resulted in unrealized losses 
these unrealized losses limit the bank s ability to sell these securities without realizing those losses 
however  these securities are available to pledge as collateral for borrowings if the need should arise 
the bank has established a master repurchase agreement with a correspondent bank to enable such transactions 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more is set forth in table eleven 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available 
table eleven certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more year ended three months or less  over three months through six months  over six months through twelve months  over twelve months  total  loan demand also affects the bank s liquidity position

disclosure of fair value the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards number  disclosures about fair value of financial statements  requires the disclosure of fair value of most financial instruments  whether recognized or not recognized in the financial statements 
the intent of presenting the fair values of financial instruments is to depict the market s assessment of the present value of net future cash flows discounted to reflect both current interest rates and the market s assessment of the risk that the cash flows will not occur 
in determining fair values  the company used the carrying amount for cash  short term investments  accrued interest receivable  short term borrowings and accrued interest payable as all of these instruments are short term in nature 
securities are reflected at quoted market values 
loans and deposits have a long term time horizon which required more complex calculations for fair value determination 
loans are grouped into homogeneous categories and broken down between fixed and variable rate instruments 
loans with a variable rate  which reprice immediately  are valued at carrying value 
the fair value of fixed rate instruments is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates 
credit risk and repricing risk factors are included in the current rates 
fair value for nonaccrual loans is reported at carrying value and is included in the net loan total 
since the allowance for loan losses exceeds any potential adjustment for nonaccrual valuation  no further valuation adjustment has been made 
demand deposits  savings and certain money market accounts are short term in nature so the carrying value equals the fair value 
for deposits that extend over a period in excess of four months  the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash payments using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities 
at year end  the fair values calculated on the bank s assets are below the carrying values versus 
above the carrying values at year end the change in the calculated fair value percentage relates to the loan category and is the result of changes in interest rates in see note of the financial statements 
year during and  management of the company focused the appropriate resources to address the potential problems that could arise regarding the year yk century date change 
the company s mission critical systems were evaluated  modified as required and contingency plans were put into place should the systems have experienced any failures 
the yk readiness of vendors and customers was also evaluated and monitored 
the century date change passed without any operational difficulties for the company  its vendors or its customers 
there are certain dates within the year that have been identified as critical processing dates 
the first was january  the end of the first month of the year 
the second was february  leap year day 
the company did not experience any processing problems on those dates 
upcoming dates during the year are march  the end of the first quarter  october  the first date to require an digit field and december  the end of the year 
those dates were tested as part of the yk project 
the company does not anticipate having any processing problems on those dates  however  failure by third parties adequately to remediate yk issues could have an impact upon central coast bancorp which is impossible to quantify 
nevertheless  the company currently expects that its yk compliance efforts will be successful without material adverse effects on its business 
accounting pronouncements the financial standards accounting board has proposed the elimination of pooling of interests accounting by december  the result of this accounting change will be that all mergers consummated after december  will be accounted for as purchase transactions  resulting in the amortization of goodwill in any merger where the purchase price exceeds the asset value of the acquired company 
the goodwill amortization will reduce future reported income of the merged companies 
additionally  in bank mergers  the goodwill in a purchase accounting transaction will not be included in the calculation of regulatory capital requirements 
some investment bankers have expressed the view that the elimination of pooling of interests accounting will result in lower merger premiums for sellers with the possibility of fewer transactions occurring after december  for additional discussion of accounting pronouncements  see note one in the consolidated financial statements at item item a
