net sales for the industrial tools business segment for were  compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
tungsten carbide cutting tool sales  which have slowed since the first half of  experienced lower demand from the metalworking market 
wear part sales also declined  primarily for downhole drilling products  as the oil industry suffered from low oil prices for most of construction tool sales have increased over due to an increase in road construction and repairs resulting in strong demand for the new pyramid tipped construction tool and the addition of new road construction customers 
coal mining tool sales have declined in  particularly in the last half of the year  principally due to a slowdown in coal production 
sales in this segment also declined due to price reductions to selected customers that were necessary to meet competitive pricing 
despite the sales decline in the industrial tools segment  operating income of  in for this segment improved slightly compared with operating income of  in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for compared with in the prior year 
efforts to reduce operating costs along with lower raw material costs have resulted in the improvement to operating income

sales of both wire formed products and powdered metal components declined in  as a result of lower demand from the lawn and garden market and inventory adjustments made by key customers 
industrial metal components operating income for was  an increase of  compared with  in as a percentage of net sales  operating income for improved to from in the prior year 
improvement to operating income for this segment resulted from lower operating costs associated with full production at the fansteel de mexico facility 
order backlog at december  was  a decrease of  or  from december  advanced structures experienced the largest decline in backlog  with reduced orders from aircraft manufacturers 
the industrial tools backlog also declined due to the slowdown in the metalworking industry

net sales for the industrial tools business segment for were  an increase of  or  from tungsten carbide cutting tools experienced a strong first half of  particularly in rotary tools 
rotary tools benefited from equipment investments made in which provided the production capacity needed to meet the higher customer demand and improved stock availability 
insert sales  also classified within the cutting tools product line  showed improvement as customers placed heavier emphasis on a mix of products related to diamond tipped inserts 
construction tool sales posted its highest quarterly sales of the last two years in the second and third quarters of  resulting in full year sales gains over the improvement in construction tool sales was attributable to new tool designs and increased marketing efforts  as well as increased demand from road construction and repair programs across the country 
coal mining tool sales improved as order activity from the mines continued to be solid throughout shipments of wear parts decreased from primarily due to slowdowns in the die market and particularly in the oil drilling market as the price of oil declined approximately since year end industrial tools business segment operating income was  for compared to  for as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for compared to in while the segment experienced higher production volume  the full benefit of the volume increase was hampered by expansion expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income was positively impacted by lower material and outside processing costs 
this was more than offset by higher labor and overhead costs which resulted from capacity constraints and the related facility expansions

as a percentage of net sales  operating income was in compared with  excluding the unusual charges  in the sand casting operation was able to improve operating margins as some sales price increases were attained  scrap costs were better controlled  and rework was reduced 
operating margin in was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies at the forging facility related primarily to the steam delivery system 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contd 
industrial metal components business segment net sales for were  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
wire formed products reported its highest quarterly sales ever in the first and second quarters of  which led to a increase in sales over improvements were due primarily to the strong demand from the lawn and garden equipment industry as well as from intensified efforts to increase the customer base within this product line 
investment casting revenues  which improved over  were positively impacted by increased demand for engine components used in the medium duty truck industry 
sales of powdered metal components remained flat in compared to as key customers experienced capacity constraints and production problems 
industrial metal components business segment operating income for was  compared to  in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for compared to in operating income was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies at the investment casting facility which was operating over capacity  adversely impacting direct labor  outside services  and process yields 
fansteel de mexico was established in august  to relieve capacity constraints 
the segment was negatively impacted by start up expenses associated with fansteel de mexico 
order backlog at december  was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or  with order activity softening in the second half of the tungsten carbide cutting tool backlog was responsible for a large portion of the industrial tools business segment decline as these product sales suffered from lower order rates from the metalworking industry 
advanced structures business segment backlog decreased from the prior year  primarily in the forgings and machining backlogs which experienced lower order activity in the last half of  especially in the last two months of this decline in order activity was related to the significant revision of production schedules by the major commercial aircraft producers for and later years 
industrial metal components business segment backlog increased due to strong orders received during for investment castings that resulted partially from a continued effort to increase its customer base 
however  the order activity from the light truck market remained the key factor in the growth of the investment castings backlog 
inflation factors did not  and generally do not  significantly affect the overall operations of the company 
outlook sales and order rates in a number of key markets including metalworking and the commercial aircraft market experienced decreases in the last half of compared to the first half of for  these markets remained at a lower level 
the metalworking market for is projected to improve slightly while the commercial aircraft market is expected to remain flat 
the company is seeking increased share of current markets  as well as new markets  through improvements in the company s production processes  new product development  and investment in current operating units  such as the fansteel de mexico start up which began full production in cost control programs remain active in all operating plants throughout the company 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contd 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  at december   a decrease of  from december  in accordance with management s program to expand the operations of the company  investments of  were made in capital equipment 
engineering  equipment and start up costs of  were incurred for the processing plant being built for reclamation and decommissioning purposes in muskogee  oklahoma 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced the suspension of the quarterly shareholder dividend for the purpose of conserving cash for capital reinvestment  possible future acquisitions  and due to potential changes in funding requirements for decommissioning at the company s discontinued operation in muskogee  oklahoma 
cash and cash equivalents on hand have been sufficient to date to meet the demands of working capital investments  expenditures for machinery and equipment  environmental costs and other normal operating requirements 
however  the company s line of credit was increased to million on may  as of december   there were no borrowings from the revolving line of credit  but million was being used for letters of credit needed for funding assurance related to environmental issues  self insurance policies and development loans 
the company may further use a portion of this unused credit during to fund the start up of the reclamation processing plant in muskogee 
funding assistance by states and municipalities is investigated when any significant expenditures are proposed 
all of the company s debt is related to development loans obtained from various states 
environmental remediation and discontinued operations the company discontinued its metal products business segment in environmental reclamation and decommissioning is required for the segment s primary plant that processed certain ores that are subject to regulations of several government agencies 
the residues from these processed ores were stored on site 
remaining assets were written down to estimated realizable value  and provisions were made for the estimated costs for decommissioning 
prior to decommissioning  the company expects to operate for approximately ten years a commercial plant to complete the processing of residues currently contained in storage ponds at the site  which will materially reduce the amount of radioactive materials to be disposed of during decommissioning 
the processing plant will extract commercially valuable materials such as tantalum  columbium  scandium and other rare earth and rare metal elements from the feedstock residues 
pilot production processing began in the third quarter of the company  in association with outside consultants  developed a decommissioning plan for the site involved including construction of an engineered on site cell for containment of contaminated soils  consolidation and stabilization of the contaminated soils in the containment cell  and the performance of required plant surveys and characterization after residue processing ceases to determine whether additional contaminated soils exist which may require remediation  and submitted that plan and a related decommissioning funding plan to the nuclear regulatory commission nrc as item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contd 
required by law 
the nrc requested in may that the company change its submittal to separate the property approximately acres being considered for unrestricted use from property approximately acres being considered for the on site containment cell 
the unrestricted use property plan was submitted in june and approved in august  with the nrc license amended accordingly 
the plan dealing with the on site containment cell was submitted in august in september  the nrc published its intent to review this submittal for the purpose of amending the license 
in response to the notice  a petition was filed with the nrc by the oklahoma attorney general requesting a hearing in order to dispute the appropriateness of constructing the on site containment cell 
a hearing was granted  but the company expects that it would be held no earlier than the conclusion of the nrc s initial review of the plan  which should require at least one year 
on site containment of the contaminated soils may require preparation of an environmental impact statement and  in addition to the required nrc approval  local and other federal agencies may have to be satisfied that the company s disposal plan is sound 
the approval process for on site containment can be expected to extend over a number of years 
management believes that a decommissioning plan including on site containment will ultimately be acceptable to the appropriate regulatory authorities  and will be approved  based on current nrc regulations or provisions of the nuclear waste policy act of however  there is no assurance that a plan providing for on site containment will ultimately be approved 
implementation of a decommissioning plan for the company s site that includes off site disposal may not be financially feasible 
the nrc decommissioning regulations require licensees to estimate the cost for decommissioning and to assure in advance that adequate funds will be available to cover those costs 
nrc regulations identify a number of acceptable methods for assuring funds for decommissioning  including surety instruments such as letters of credit  cash deposits and combinations thereof 
the level of assurance for decommissioning  including on site containment  is currently  provided through letters of credit 
the amount does not include assurance for costs of operation of the residue processing facility even though the nrc had previously indicated that the cost of processing should be included in the cost estimate 
this level of assurance  however  may be changed upon further review by the nrc 
the company s available cash and or borrowing capacity will be reduced by the amount of funding assurance as required at any particular time 
as the decommissioning plan is implemented  deposited funds or the amount of any surety instruments may be reduced  provided the company can demonstrate the sufficiency of the remaining funds or surety to assure the completion of decommissioning 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for discontinued operations including the estimated net costs of reclaiming and decommissioning the site during and after the approximate ten years of processing the residues and the company s estimated share of costs at a second site which had been part of the metal products business segment 
the second site is regulated under the resource conservation and recovery act and  as a result of alleged migration of contaminants from this second site  the company also has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla at a neighboring third party site 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contd 
the estimated net costs of reclaiming and decommissioning the first site during the residue processing period include estimated annual revenues at full production of approximately million per year over the ten year processing period and estimated annual operating costs  including depreciation  of approximately the same amount  related to residue processing 
the estimated value of materials to be extracted is based on analysis of samples taken from the residues and a valuation of such materials using current market prices discounted to reflect possible price decreases  including those which will result from the increased quantities of certain of these materials made available for sale 
however  there can be no assurance as to the level of demand for the extracted materials or the actual prices which may be obtained for them  which could vary over time 
the estimated costs of residue processing were developed by company personnel and independent consultants using third party evaluations based on the testing performed 
unforeseen production complications could cause processing costs to increase from current estimates 
in addition to the two sites included in the discontinued operations  the company has a total of seven sites at other company facilities where environmental remediation is ongoing or will be undertaken 
certain of these sites were identified as a result of environmental studies conducted by the company during at all of its owned sites  including testing of soil and groundwater at selected sites as indicated by the environmental studies 
the company has also been notified that it is a potentially responsible party at six sites owned by third parties 
the company s participation at four sites is de minimis  and at the other two sites the company is either being defended by its insurance carriers or has meritorious defenses to liability 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  for estimated environmental investigatory and remediation costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the results of environmental studies and testing conducted in  and considering existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
actual costs to be incurred in future periods at identified sites may vary from the estimates  given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
future information and developments will require the company to continually reassess the expected impact of these environmental matters 
the company does not expect that any sums it may have to pay in connection with these environmental liabilities would have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
year disclosure many existing information technology it products and systems and non it products and systems containing embedded processor technology were originally programmed to represent any date by using six digits eg   as opposed to eight digits eg  
accordingly  such products and systems may experience miscalculations  malfunctions  or disruptions when attempting to process information containing dates that fall after december  these potential problems are collectively referred to as the year problem 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contd 
during and prior years  the company engaged in an ongoing  comprehensive project to assess and remediate the impact on its computer systems and programs of the year problem 
to date  there have been no significant year issues related to the company s computer systems or to the computer systems of the company s major customers and suppliers
