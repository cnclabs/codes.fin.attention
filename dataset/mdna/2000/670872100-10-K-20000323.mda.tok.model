in the salts category  the increase in physical volume of products sold reflects higher sales of memory disk and battery grade chemicals in asia pacific 
the increase in physical volume of powder products reflects continued strong growth in sales of cobalt fine powder to the hard metal tool industry  coarse grade powders to the rechargeable battery market and stainless steel alloy powders in automotive applications 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the improvement in gross profit was primarily the result of increased volumes and an improved product mix increasing contribution from higher value added products 
cost of products sold decreased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in as a result of lower cobalt pricing and improved product mix

cobalt market prices per pound dropped from approximately at september   to by december   and then rebounded to approximately during the first quarter of when raw material prices decrease precipitously  the company s lifo inventory value may exceed the value at which the inventory can be sold ie  lifo inventory costs may exceed market 
consequently  the company evaluates its inventory carrying value to state it at the lower of cost or market 
at december   no adjustment to carrying value was needed  as the market value of the inventory exceeded lifo cost 
pounds of product sold by the company were million pounds during compared to million pounds in the increase in carboxylate products sold was primarily the result of the acquisition of dussek campbell limited dussek and increases in sales of cobalt carboxylates and pvc additives 
in the salts category  the increase was due to the acquisition of fidelity as overall nickel salt volumes  excluding fidelity  declined due primarily to a decrease in the sales of lower margin nickel sulfate products 
the increase in physical volume of powder products reflects the introduction of tungsten powders during and overall growth in cobalt extra fine powders  which offset a decrease in copper powder volumes related to slowness in the aerospace and agricultural equipment business areas 
gross profit increased to million in  a increase from the improvement in gross profit was primarily the result of the acquisitions of fidelity and dussek  an increased contribution from higher value added products  and higher physical volume excluding the decrease in lower margin nickel sulfate products 
cost of products sold decreased to of net sales for the year ended from of net sales in primarily because of lower cobalt  nickel and copper market prices  which declined more rapidly than selling prices  improved product mix and the acquisitions of fidelity and dussek 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from of net sales in  due to the acquisition of fidelity and its relatively higher selling  administrative  and research expenses per dollar of sales  and to the decline in net sales resulting from lower cobalt  nickel and copper prices

net income for was million  an increase of million from  primarily due to the aforementioned factors 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s net working capital increased by approximately million 
this increase was primarily the result of provisional payments made on cobalt copper concentrate 
capital expenditures in were primarily related to the continuing smelter construction project in lubumbashi  democratic republic of congo and the completion of the company s solvent extraction unit in kokkola  finland 
these working capital increases and capital expenditures were funded through additional borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
in january   the company s revolving credit facility was revised to increase available credit to million  and to expand its sources of capital by adding three new institutions 
the company may also borrow up to million under a demand note agreement expiring march  at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under this demand note agreement 
the company believes that it will have sufficient cash generated by operations and through its credit facilities to provide for its future working capital and capital expenditure requirements  and to pay quarterly dividends on its common stock  subject to the board s discretion 
in february  the board of directors authorized an increase in quarterly dividends to 
per share 
subject to several limitations in its credit facilities  the company may incur additional borrowings to finance working capital and certain capital expenditures  including  without limitation  the purchase of additional raw materials 
the company has ongoing capital expenditure programs to improve its processing technology and plant and equipment  and to expand capacity to accommodate future growth 
the company anticipates that capital spending  exclusive of acquisitions or joint ventures  will approximate million for although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices will affect the company s operating results and net income see page international operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt  nickel and copper 
while nickel and copper are worldwide commodities and generally available  cobalt availability can be more uncertain 
the company s supply of cobalt has historically been sourced primarily from the democratic republic of congo  australia  finland and zambia 
although the company has never experienced a material shortage of cobalt  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may affect the supply and market price of cobalt 
if a substantial interruption should occur in supply from a primary source  there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain as much cobalt from other sources as would be necessary to satisfy the company s requirements at prices comparable to its current arrangements 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in prices and availability by maintaining adequate inventories and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to both actual and perceived changes in supply and demand 
generally  the company is able to pass through to its customers increases and decreases in raw material prices by increasing or decreasing  respectively  the prices of its products 
the degree of profitability 
table of contents of the company principally depends on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
substantial  sustained reductions in the price of raw materials  particularly cobalt  could also result in the company s inventory being written down to market value see results of operations  compared to 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in variable rate instruments 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the variable rate instruments to fixed rate contracts over typically a three year period 
there is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements see note c 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the company s long term debt 
expected maturity date december  fair thousands of dollars thereafter total value long term debt  including current portion fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate expected maturity date december  fair thousands of dollars thereafter total value long term debt  including current portion fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate in addition to the united states  the company has manufacturing and other facilities in canada  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are transacted in us dollars  liabilities for us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices may affect the company s operating results and net income see page international operations

this project has been completed using a combination of existing internal and external resources 
the total cost of the year project was million and was funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately 
million was attributable to a new software purchase  which has been capitalized 
the remaining million  which was expensed as incurred  did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the company
