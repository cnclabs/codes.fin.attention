overview of organogenesis inc organogenesis inc a tissue engineering firm designs  develops and manufactures medical products containing living cells and or natural connective tissue 
we are the developer and manufacturer of the only mass manufactured medical product containing living human cells marketed in the us 
our product development program includes living tissue replacements  cell based organ assist devices and other tissue engineered products 
our lead product  apligraf r skin construct  was launched in the us in june by marketer novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
our strategy is to commercialize products either by ourselves or through partners with an established marketing presence 
our lead product  apligraf apligraf is approved and marketed in the us for the treatment of venous leg ulcers 
in december  organogenesis applied to the fda for marketing approval for a second indication diabetic foot ulcers 
novartis pharma ag has global apligraf marketing rights 
in fourth quarter  novartis began initial product introduction in switzerland  the first of several planned in europe 
novartis also markets apligraf in canada 
a pivotal trial is underway designed to assess whether use of apligraf to treat wounds due to skin cancer surgery leads to a better cosmetic outcome 
data from smaller apligraf studies  including in donor site wounds  burns and epidermolysis bullosa a genetic skin disorder  were published or presented during our pipeline our pipeline includes vitrix soft tissue replacement product  now in pilot human clinical trials  our vascular graft program  currently in animal studies  and our liver assist device program  currently in research 
our portfolio also includes potential licensing opportunities 
these opportunities include graftpatch tm soft tissue reinforcement product  which has been cleared for marketing through the fda k process  testskin tm ii  an in vitro testing product  our conditioned medium  a cell culture product found to stimulate the generation of certain skin cell types  and our proprietary technology to produce collagen fibrils designed to provide local tissue bulking 
results of operations with the approval and launch of apligraf  we began a new era of operations 
we are seeing  as expected  a gradual ramp up in sales 
we expect production costs to exceed product sales for the near term due to start up expenses and the high costs associated with low volume production 
however  we expect production volume to increase 
revenue total revenues for years  and consisted of r d support from related party   product sales to related party and others    other income    interest income    the year over year increase in product sales to related party and others is due to increased unit sales of apligraf to novartis 
we expect apligraf commercial sales to continue to increase 
product sales to others are insignificant in and  and are approximately  in the increase in other income is mainly due to novartis funding of certain programs 
r d support payments are recognized when earned and are nonrefundable 
the year over year changes in interest income are primarily due to the difference in funds available for investment 
expenses cost of product sales our cost of product sales was  in all costs of production prior to were included in research and development expenses due to insignificant commercial sales and low production volume associated with early stage commercial launch 
cost of product sales includes the direct costs to manufacture and package apligraf and an allocation of our production related indirect costs 
cost of product sales exceeded product sales due to the start up costs of new product introduction and the high costs associated with low volume production 
we expect production volume to increase and our margins to improve 
we expect to continue to expand production operations during the next months 
research and development our r d and operations expenses consist of costs associated with research  development  clinical and operations excluding cost of sales in 
these expenses increased to  for  from  in and  in the increase in was primarily due to approximately  in personnel costs  outside services  supplies  and occupancy costs to support our ongoing programs  including vitrix and liver assist device  as well as costs to support publications studies and other sponsored programs  offset by an approximate  net decrease in clinical related costs as last year included non recurring expenses related to fda approval and the apligraf diabetic ulcer pivotal trial was at its peak  and offset by an approximate  net decrease in operating related expenditures 
the increase in  which included cost of product sales on insignificant commercial sales and low volume production  was primarily due to the following approximately  clinical trials activity  including the apligraf diabetic ulcer pivotal trial and non recurring expenses related to fda approval  approximately  for progressing preclinical programs  including vitrix  and approximately  relating to investing in manufacturing operations  including personnel additions 
we expect to continue to advance the product pipeline during the next months 
general and administrative expenses our g a expenses include the costs of our corporate  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
g a expenses increased to  for from  in and  in the increase is primarily due to approximately  for personnel additions and increased outside and professional fees  approximately  relating to occupancy costs and consolidating administrative facilities  and approximately  for the estimated fair value of warrants issued relating to a consulting contract 
the increase of  is primarily due to adding support staff and higher outside and professional services  partially relating to regulatory related activities 
we expect the growth in g a expenses to increase at a slower rate 
other costs and expenses included in costs and expenses for is a non cash charge of  relating to the purchase of incomplete technology to be used specifically in our liver assist device research and development efforts refer to the commitments footnote to the financial statements for a full description of this technology 
the purchase was made to strengthen our resources to develop the technology 
the charge to expense was due to the early stage of the technology that has not provided proof of principle 
additionally  the time and cost to prove this principle is not known 
this program is expected to be a long term endeavor that will be evaluated periodically to determine future spending levels 
it is expected that development of a liver assist device will cost millions of dollars and take to years before we could develop a product  which might be approved for commercial sale 
we do not currently have the resources to fully develop such a product 
it is our intent that once proof of principle is established  we will seek funding or partnership for the project 
additionally  in may  we incurred a one time  non cash compensation charge of  relating to the extension of the term of a stock option held by an officer 
interest expense was  for due to the issuance of convertible debentures in march net income we incurred a net loss of  or 
per share basic and diluted for  compared to a net loss of  or

novartis support the collaborative agreement with novartis provides us with up to  in equity investments and nonrefundable research  development and milestone support payments  of which was received during   in  and  in  all of which are non refundable 
the remaining payments are based upon achievement of specified events 
during march  we received  from novartis  which represents a milestone support payment received in advance of achievement of the milestone 
under the agreement  we supply novartis global requirements for apligraf and receive revenue consisting of a per unit manufacturing payment and royalties on product sales 
financing from inception  we have financed our operations substantially through private and public placements of equity securities  as well as receipt of research support and contract revenues  interest income from investments  sale of products and receipt of royalties 
during  financing activities provided additional cash and working capital of approximately  primarily from the sale of five year convertible debentures and warrants to purchase common stock that generated net proceeds of  the issuance of a term loan that generated proceeds of  and the exercise of stock options of  offset by the purchase of treasury stock totaling  financing activities provided cash of approximately  during from the sale of shares of series c convertible preferred stock that generated net proceeds of approximately  an equity investment of  from novartis  and the exercise of stock options of  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock totaling  the repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes 
during march  we redeemed in cash all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock for approximately  at december   we had approximately shares of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
in the event that any series c preferred stock are outstanding on the mandatory conversion date of march   we have the option of redeeming any such outstanding series c preferred stock by paying cash equal to the product of the number of series c preferred stock outstanding multiplied by the stated value of  per share  issuing common stock equal to of the stated value divided by the average of the closing bid prices for the consecutive trading days prior to the mandatory conversion date  or any combination of these methods 
on march   we completed a financing of  through the private placement of five year convertible debentures and  warrants to purchase common stock 
the debentures are convertible at a fixed price of per share at any time on or after march  interest on the debentures accrues at annually  payable in cash  common stock at the average trading price for the twenty trading days preceding the due date or any combination thereof  at our option  semi annually on september and march or on the date any of the principal outstanding under the notes has been converted into common stock 
at our option  at any time on or after march   the debentures may be prepaid by conversion of the principal into common stock at the conversion price of  cash or any combination thereof and payment of any accrued interest as described above  provided that the average per share market value for the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of prepayment equals or exceeds per share 
the notes mature on march  and are payable in cash 
the warrants grant the right to purchase one share of common stock at the exercise price of for each in face value of the convertible notes at any time before march  approximately  of the  financing is allocated to the estimated fair value of the warrants and is included in additional paid in capital 
this amount is amortized as a non cash charge to interest expense over the life of the debentures 
debt issuance costs are included in other assets and are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debentures 
in may  we filed a registration statement for  shares of common stock issuable as follows  shares of common stock which may become issuable by reason of the conversion of the convertible debt  and accrued interest   shares which may become issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued in the financing  and  shares issued in connection with an asset purchase transaction 
all shares have been reserved for issuance 
in may  the securities and exchange commission declared this registration statement effective 
in  we received notice of grants to support two research projects  grant under the advanced technology program of the national institute for standards and technology nist to help support our development of an effective liver assist device prototype  which we expect to receive over the next two years commencing in december  and  grant under the small business innovation research program of the national institutes of health to support development of our vascular graft  which we have received  in and expect to receive the next  over the next three months 
both of these grants require that the federal government can access for its own purposes technology developed using the funding 
a product developed based on the funding from the nist grant must be manufactured substantially in the united states 
in addition  we are subject to regular audit and reporting requirements 
in addition  we received notice from the commonwealth of massachusetts that we were selected to receive a workforce training grant for approximately  to support employee training  which we have received  in and expect to receive the remainder over the next twelve months 
in november of  we entered into a  term loan agreement with a commercial bank to finance the purchase of certain equipment  leasehold improvements and other items 
borrowings under the term loan are collateralized by a security interest in the items financed 
the agreement provides repayment of the principal amount of the loan in equal quarterly installments commencing december   with final payment due on september  the loan bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum that is equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time  or we may elect that all or any portion of any term loan be made as a libor loan with an interest period of one month  two months  three months or six months with the interest rate being equal to libor plus an applicable margin to basis points 
we are required to comply with certain covenants relating to our outstanding term loans  involving limitations on future indebtedness  dividends and investments  and to maintain certain financial covenants pertaining to liquidity  capital base  and debt service coverage or  alternatively  maintaining a minimum unencumbered cash balance 
because we exercised our option to redeem all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock for cash subsequent to year end  we did not maintain compliance with the liquidity covenant as of december  the bank granted a waiver from this covenant 
after raising additional capital subsequent to year end  we are now in compliance with all covenants 
at december   we borrowed approximately  against this term loan to finance certain research  manufacturing and office equipment and leasehold improvements 
the weighted average interest rate paid during this period was 
this borrowing is collateralized by a security interest in the fixed assets financed 
on february   the securities and exchange commission declared effective a shelf registration for the placement of up to  shares of common stock with an aggregate offering price not to exceed  in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share under this shelf registration yielding net proceeds of approximately  gruntal co 
acted in an agency capacity for this placement 
in march  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share under this shelf registration yielding proceeds of approximately  additionally  from january through march   we received approximately  from the exercise of employee stock options 
liquidity based upon our current plans  we believe that common stock issued subsequent to december   together with existing working capital and future funds from novartis  including product and royalty revenue  will be sufficient to finance operations into however  this statement is forward looking and changes may occur that would significantly decrease available cash before such time 
factors that may change our cash requirements include o delays in obtaining regulatory approvals of products in different countries  if needed  and subsequent timing of product launches  o delays in commercial acceptance and reimbursement when product launches occur  o changes in the progress of research and development programs  and o changes in the resources devoted to outside research collaborations or projects  self funded projects  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies 
any of these events could adversely impact our capital resources  requiring us to raise additional funds 
management believes that additional funds may be available through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners  capital lease arrangements  or other sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurances that these funds will be available when required on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we would need to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and development programs or license to third parties certain products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourselves  resulting in a potential material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
taxes at december   we had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  these losses and tax credits are available to reduce federal and state taxable income and income taxes  respectively  in future years  if any 
however  the realizability of deferred tax assets is not assured as it depends upon future taxable income 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against these assets 
we are required to recognize all or a portion of net deferred tax assets  with corresponding increases to net income  when we believe  given the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other credits will be realized 
however  there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any future cash flows or benefits from these losses and tax credits 
ownership changes may result in future limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
year we previously discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
