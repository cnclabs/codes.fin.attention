item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading general 
the major categories of our advertisers include telephone companies  restaurants  fast food  automotive and grocery 
each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
we pay a higher commission rate to the sales staff for generating direct sales because we believe that through direct advertiser relationships we can better understand the advertiser s business needs and more effectively design an advertising campaign to help the advertiser sell its product or service 
we employ personnel in each of our markets to produce commercials for the advertisers 
national sales are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level in exchange for a commission from us that is based on our gross revenue from the advertising obtained 
regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to companies that advertise in our markets  are generally made by our local sales staff 
depending on the programming format of a particular station  we estimate the optimum number of advertisements available for sale 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels  and the resulting ratings  is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based on local market conditions and on our ability  through our marketing efforts  to provide advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory that it makes available for advertising 
this target level of inventory for sale may be different at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
much of our selling activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station 
therefore  most changes in revenue are explained by demand driven pricing changes rather than by changes in the available inventory 
we believe that radio is one of the most efficient and cost effective means for advertisers to reach specific demographic groups 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on a station s share of audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured by ratings surveys estimating the number of listeners tuned to the station at various times  the number of stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and certain qualitative factors 
rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
each station s ratings are used by our advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by us to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is the arbitron company  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of ratings data 
competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
the success of each of our stations depends largely upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
our audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change  and any adverse change in a particular market affecting advertising expenditures or an adverse change in the relative market positions of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our radio stations located in that market 
there can be no assurance that any one of our radio stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share 
our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue directly with other radio stations within their respective markets 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong listener base consisting of a specific demographic group in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
companies that operate radio stations must be alert to the possibility of another station changing its format to compete directly for listeners and advertisers 
another station s decision to convert to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue  increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower broadcast cash flow for us 
factors that are material to a radio station s competitive position include management experience  the station s local audience rank in its market  transmitter power  assigned frequency  audience characteristics  local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by extensively researching our stations programming  by implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and by managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars 
however  we compete with some organizations that have greater financial resources than we have 
fcc policies and rules permit ownership and operation of multiple local radio stations 
we believe that radio stations that elect to take advantage of joint arrangements such as local marketing agreements or joint sales agreements may in certain circumstances have lower operating costs and may be able to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services 
although we currently operate multiple stations in most of our markets and intend to pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups  our competitors in certain markets include operators of multiple stations or operators who already have entered into local marketing agreements or joint sales agreements 
we also compete with other radio station groups to purchase additional stations 
some of these groups are owned or operated by companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
although the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive  some barriers to entry exist 
the operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the fcc  and the number of radio stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of fm and am radio frequencies allotted by the fcc to communities in that market  as well as by the fcc s multiple ownership rules regulating the number of stations that may be owned and controlled by a single entity 
the fcc s multiple ownership rules have changed significantly as a result of the telecommunications act 
for more information about fcc regulation and the provisions of the telecommunications act  see the discussion below under the heading federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
our stations also compete for advertising revenue with other media  including newspapers  broadcast television  cable television  magazines  direct mail  coupons and outdoor advertising 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced  such as the delivery of audio programming by cable television systems  by satellite and by digital audio broadcasting 
digital audio broadcasting may deliver by satellite to nationwide and regional audiences  multi channel  multi format  digital radio services with sound quality equivalent to compact discs 
the delivery of information through the internet has also created a new form of competition 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information 
a growing population and greater availability of radios  particularly car and portable radios  have contributed to this growth 
there can be no assurance  however  that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry 
the fcc has recently authorized spectrum for the use of a new technology  satellite digital audio radio services  to deliver audio programming 
digital audio radio services may provide a medium for the delivery by satellite or terrestrial means of multiple new audio programming formats to local and national audiences 
it is not known at this time whether this digital technology also may be used in the future by existing radio broadcast stations either on existing or alternate broadcasting frequencies 
the fcc has acted to create a new low power radio service which could open up opportunities for low cost neighborhood service on frequencies which would not interfere with existing stations 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc  nor can we assess in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
see the discussion below under the heading federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting introduction 
the ownership  operation and sale of broadcast stations  including those licensed to us  are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc 
the fcc acts under authority derived from the communications act of  as amended 
the communications act was amended in by the telecommunications act of to make changes in several broadcast laws 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for broadcasting  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates equipment used by stations  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations  and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the communications act 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and of specific fcc regulations and policies 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including fines  the grant of short less than the maximum license renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of a license or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional broadcast properties 
reference should be made to the communications act  fcc rules and the public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations 
license grant and renewal 
until recently  radio broadcast licenses were granted for maximum terms of seven years  but acting under the authority of the telecommunications act  the fcc recently revised its rules to extend the maximum term for future renewals to eight years 
licenses may be renewed through an application to the fcc 
the telecommunications act prohibits the fcc from considering any competing applications for the radio frequency if the fcc finds that the licensee s station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  that there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or the rules and regulations of the fcc  and that there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or the rules and regulations of the fcc that  when taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
these petitions may raise various issues before the fcc 
the fcc is required to hold hearings on renewal applications if the fcc is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity  or if a petition to deny raises a substantial and material question of fact as to whether the grant of the renewal application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest  convenience and necessity 
also  during certain periods when a renewal application is pending  the transferability of the applicant s license is restricted 
we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations  although there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed 
the fcc classifies each am and fm station 
an am station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is one on which am stations are assigned to serve wide areas 
clear channel am stations are classified as either class a stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designated to render primary and secondary service over an extended area  class b stations  which operate on an unlimited time basis and are designed to render service only over a primary service area  or class d stations  which operate either during daytime hours only  during limited times only or on an unlimited time basis with low nighttime power 
a regional channel is one on which class b and class d am stations may operate and serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is one on which am stations operate on an unlimited time basis and serve primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous thereto 
class c am stations operate on a local channel and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm station are determined by its class 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c and c 
the following table sets forth the market  call letters  fcc license classification  antenna height above average terrain haat  power and frequency of each of the stations we own or operate  assuming the completion of the pending transactions described above under the heading pending transactions  and the date on which each station s fcc license expires 
as you review the information in the following table  you should note the following the symbol indicates a station which is the subject of one of our pending transactions 
the completion of each of the pending transactions is subject to conditions 
although we believe these conditions are generally customary for transactions of this type  there can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied 
see the discussion above under the heading pending transactions 
a station s actual city of license may be different from the shown metropolitan market served 
in addition  three of the stations listed as little rock stations primarily serve the surrounding communities outside of little rock 
pursuant to fcc rules and regulations  many am radio stations are licensed to operate at a reduced power during nighttime broadcasting hours  which results in reducing the radio station s coverage during those hours of operation 
both power ratings are shown  where applicable

we may agree to sell one or more of the indicated stations serving saginaw bay city midland in connection with our pending acquisition of stations serving saginaw bay city midland 
we operate katg fm under a local marketing agreement 
we expect to operate wkoe fm under a program service and time brokerage agreement 
wyos fm in binghamton operates pursuant to a construction permit 
an application for a license to cover the construction permit has been filed with the fcc 
expiration of the construction permit is stayed during the pendency of that application 
ownership matters 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to assign  transfer  grant or renew a broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee  including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests therein  and compliance with the communications act s limitation on alien ownership  as well as compliance with other fcc policies 
once a station purchase agreement has been signed  an application for fcc consent to assignment of license or transfer of control  depending upon whether the underlying transaction is an asset purchase or stock acquisition  is filed with the fcc 
approximately to days after this filing  the fcc normally publishes a notice assigning a file number to the application and advising that the application has been accepted for filing 
the fcc has recently instituted an informal policy of inviting public comment on any proposed radio transaction that would result in one broadcaster controlling at least half of all radio advertising revenue in a market  or two broadcasters controlling or more of market revenue 
this policy has resulted in delays in the fcc s acceptance of applications for filing  and in subsequent action on assignment and transfer applications 
notice of acceptance of an application begins a day statutory waiting period  which provides the opportunity for third parties to file formal petitions to deny the transaction 
informal objections may be filed any time prior to grant of an application 
the fcc staff will normally review the application in this period and seek further information and amendments to the application if it has questions 
once the day public notice period ends  the staff will complete its processing  assuming that no petitions or informal objections were received and that the application is otherwise consistent with fcc rules and policies 
the staff often grants the application by delegated authority approximately to days after the public notice period ends 
at this point  the parties are legally authorized to close the purchase  although the fcc action is not legally a final order 
if there is a backlog of applications  the processing period can extend to days or more 
public notice of the fcc staff grant is usually issued about a week after the grant is made  stating that the grant was effective when made by the staff 
on the date of this notice  another day period begins  within which time interested parties can file petitions seeking either staff reconsideration or full fcc review of the staff action 
during this time the grant can still be modified  set aside or stayed  and is not a final order 
in the absence of a stay  however  the seller and buyer are not prevented from closing despite the absence of a final order 
also  within days after the public notice of the grant  the full fcc can review and reconsider the staff s grant on its own motion 
thus  during the additional days beyond the day period available to third parties  the grant is still not final 
in the event that review by the full fcc is requested and the fcc subsequently affirms the staff s grant of the application  interested parties may thereafter seek judicial review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit within days of public notice of the full fcc s action 
in the event the court affirms the fcc s action  further judicial review may be sought by seeking rehearing en banc from the court of appeals or by certiorari from the united states supreme court 
in the absence of the submission of a timely request for reconsideration  administrative review or judicial review  the fcc staff s grant of an application becomes final by operation of law 
upon the occurrence of that event  the fcc s grant is generally no longer subject to administrative or judicial review  although such action can nevertheless be set aside in rare circumstances  such as fraud on the agency by a party to the application 
the pendency of a license renewal application can alter the timetables mentioned above because the fcc normally will not issue an unconditional assignment grant if the station s license renewal is pending 
under the communications act  a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by a corporation that has more than one fifth of its capital stock owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives  or by non us corporations 
under the communications act  a broadcast license also may not be granted to or held by any corporation that is controlled  directly or indirectly  by any other corporation more than one fourth of whose capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives  or by non us corporations 
these restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations  including partnerships 
each of citadel communications and citadel broadcasting therefore may be restricted from having more than one fourth of its stock owned or voted by aliens  foreign governments or non us corporations 
the certificate of incorporation of citadel communications and the certificate of incorporation of citadel broadcasting contain provisions which permit citadel communications and citadel broadcasting to prohibit alien ownership and control consistent with the prohibitions contained in the communications act 
the communications act and fcc rules also generally restrict the common ownership  operation or control of radio broadcast stations serving the same local market  and place numerical limits on common ownership of radio and television broadcast stations serving the same local market  and of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market 
under these cross ownership rules  neither citadel communications nor citadel broadcasting would be permitted to acquire any daily newspaper where it then owned any radio broadcast station 
while common ownership of same market radio and television stations was previously permissible only through waiver of the fcc s rules  the fcc recently liberalized its radio television cross ownership rule to provide for common ownership  operation or control of one television and up to seven same market radio stations  or two television and up to six same market radio stations  if the market has at least twenty separately owned broadcast  newspaper and cable voices 
common ownership of two television and four radio stations is permissible when ten voices remain  and of one television and one radio station regardless of voice count 
in response to the telecommunications act  the fcc amended its multiple ownership rules to eliminate the national limits on ownership of am and fm stations 
the fcc s broadcast multiple ownership rules restrict the number of radio stations one person or entity may own  operate or control on a local level 
these limits are in a market with or more commercial radio stations  an entity may own up to eight commercial radio stations  not more than five of which are in the same service fm or am  in a market with more than but less than commercial radio stations  an entity may own up to seven commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service  in a market with more than but less than commercial radio stations  an entity may own up to six commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service  and in a market with or fewer commercial radio stations  an entity may own up to five commercial radio stations  not more than three of which are in the same service  except that an entity may not own more than of the stations in such market 
none of these multiple ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio broadcast stations 
however  these rules will limit the number of additional stations which we may acquire in the future in certain of our markets 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  a purchaser of voting stock of either citadel communications or citadel broadcasting which acquires an attributable interest in citadel communications or citadel broadcasting may violate the fcc s rule if it also has an attributable interest in other television or radio stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such a purchaser also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest  to the extent that these investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if an attributable shareholder of citadel communications or citadel broadcasting violates any of these ownership rules  citadel communications or citadel broadcasting may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct its radio station business and may be unable to obtain fcc consents for particular future acquisitions 
the fcc generally applies its television radio newspaper cross ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the attributable  or cognizable  interests held by a person or entity 
a person or entity can have an interest in a radio station  television station or daily newspaper by being an officer  director  partner or shareholder of a company that owns that station or newspaper 
whether that interest is cognizable under the fcc s ownership rules is determined by the fcc s attribution rules 
if an interest is attributable  the fcc treats the person or entity who holds that interest as the owner of the radio station  television station or daily newspaper in question  and therefore subject to the fcc s ownership rules 
with respect to a corporation  officers and directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly can vote or more of the corporation s stock  or or more of the corporation s stock in the case of insurance companies  investment companies  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold the stock for investment purposes only  generally are attributed with ownership of whatever radio stations  television stations and daily newspapers the corporation owns 
with respect to a partnership  the interest of a general partner is attributable  as is the interest of any limited partner who is materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership 
debt instruments  nonvoting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  limited partnership interests where the limited partner is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership  and minority under voting stock  generally do not subject their holders to attribution 
the fcc recently revised its attribution rules to eliminate its cross interest policy  which generally precluded a party with an attributable interest in one media outlet from also holding certain significant but nonattributable interests in another same market media entity  such as a joint venture or key employee relationship 
in its place  the fcc has adopted a new class of attributable interests under the equity debt plus rule 
under this standard  an interest in excess of of a licensee s total asset value equity plus debt will be attributable if the interest holder is either a major program supplier providing over of a station s total weekly broadcast programming hours or a same market media company including broadcasters  cable operators and newspapers 
the fcc has also been more aggressive in examining issues of market revenue share concentration when considering radio station acquisitions 
the fcc has delayed its approval of several pending radio station purchases by various parties because of market concentration concerns 
moreover  the fcc has recently followed an informal policy of giving specific public notice of its intention to conduct additional ownership concentration analyses and soliciting public comment on the issue of concentration and its effect on competition and diversity in connection with applications for consent to radio station acquisitions  where the proposed transaction would result in one broadcaster controlling at least half of all radio advertising revenue in a market  or two broadcasters controlling or more of market revenue 
this policy has resulted in significant delays in action on fcc assignment and transfer applications and has the potential to result in an attempt by the fcc to set applications for hearing  prevent completion of transactions or negotiate modifications to the proposed terms 
for a discussion of the effects of this policy on some of our pending transactions  see the discussion above under the heading pending transactions 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
licensees are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming will be considered by the fcc when it evaluates the licensee s renewal application  but such complaints may be filed and considered at any time 
stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification and technical operations  including limits on radio frequency radiation 
in addition  licensees must develop and implement programs designed to promote equal employment opportunities and must submit reports to the fcc on these matters annually and in connection with a renewal application 
the broadcast of contests and lotteries also is regulated by fcc rules 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures  the grant of short less than the maximum renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license 
in  the fcc adopted rules regarding human exposures to levels of radio frequency radiation 
these rules require applicants for new broadcast stations  renewals of broadcast licenses or modifications of existing licenses to inform the fcc at the time of filing such applications whether a new or existing broadcast facility would expose people to radio frequency radiation in excess of fcc guidelines 
in  the fcc imposed more restrictive radiation limits 
we anticipate that such regulations will not have a material effect on our business 
local marketing agreements 
over the past several years  a number of radio stations  including several of our stations  have entered into what commonly are referred to as local marketing agreements or time brokerage agreements 
these agreements take various forms 
separately owned and licensed stations may agree to function cooperatively in terms of programming  advertising sales and other matters  subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the fcc s rules and policies  including the requirement that the licensee of each station maintains independent control over the programming and other operations of its own station 
the fcc has held that such agreements do not violate the communications act as long as the licensee of the station that is being substantially programmed by another entity maintains complete responsibility for  and control over  operations of its broadcast stations and otherwise ensures compliance with applicable fcc rules and policies 
presently  we operate only three stations under local marketing agreements  and two are being so operated pending our acquisition of the stations 
we expect that we will begin operating one additional station under a local marketing agreement if we complete a particular pending acquisition 
a station that brokers substantial time on another station in its market or engages in a local marketing agreement with a station in the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the fcc s ownership rules discussed above under the heading ownership matters 
as a result  a broadcast station may not enter into a local marketing agreement that allows it to program more than of the broadcast time  on a weekly basis  of another local station that it could not own under the fcc s local multiple ownership rules 
fcc rules also prohibit the broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another station in the same broadcast service that is  am am or fm fm where the two stations serve substantially the same geographic area  whether the licensee owns the stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement arrangement 
another example of a cooperative agreement between separately owned radio stations in the same market is a joint sales agreement  whereby one station sells advertising time in combination  both on itself and on a station under separate ownership 
in the past  the fcc has determined that issues of joint advertising sales should be left to antitrust enforcement 
currently  joint sales agreements are not considered by the fcc to be attributable  but copies of such agreements must be filed with the fcc 
proposed changes 
congress and the fcc from time to time have under consideration  and may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio stations  and affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions 
such matters include proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  the fcc s equal employment opportunity rules and matters relating to political broadcasting  technical and frequency allocation matters  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages on radio  changes in the fcc s multiple ownership and cross ownership policies  changes to broadcast technical requirements  proposals to allow telephone or cable television companies to deliver audio and video programming to the home through existing phone or other communication lines  and proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers 
in january  the fcc adopted rules to allocate spectrum for satellite digital audio radio service 
satellite digital audio radio service systems potentially could provide for regional or nationwide distribution of radio programming with fidelity comparable to compact discs 
the fcc has issued two authorizations to launch and operate satellite digital audio radio service 
the fcc also has undertaken an inquiry into the terrestrial broadcast of digital audio radio service signals  addressing  among other things  the need for spectrum outside the existing fm band and the role of existing broadcasters 
the fcc has adopted rules to license new watt and watt low power fm radio stations 
these stations would have a service radius of approximately one to three miles 
the licensing process commenced in march the fcc has authorized an additional khz of bandwidth for the am band and on march   adopted an allotment plan for the expanded band which identified the am radio stations selected to move into the band 
at the end of a five year transition period  those licensees will be required to return to the fcc either the license for their existing am band station or the license for the expanded am band station 
we cannot predict whether any proposed changes will be adopted or what other matters might be considered in the future  nor can it judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
the foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and of specific fcc rules and policies 
this description does not purport to be comprehensive and reference should be made to the communications act  the fcc s rules and the public notices and rulings of the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
federal antitrust considerations 
the federal trade commission and the united states department of justice  which evaluate transactions to determine whether those transactions should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws  have been increasingly active recently in their review of radio station acquisitions  particularly where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  and the rules promulgated thereunder  require the parties to file notification and report forms with the federal trade commission and the department of justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
during the initial day period after the filing  the agencies decide which of them will investigate the transaction 
if the investigating agency determines that the transaction does not raise significant antitrust issues  then it will either terminate the waiting period or allow it to expire after the initial days 
on the other hand  if the agency determines that the transaction requires a more detailed investigation  then  at the conclusion of the initial day period  it will issue a formal request for additional information 
the issuance of a formal request extends the waiting period until the th calendar day after the date of substantial compliance by all parties to the acquisition 
thereafter  such waiting period may only be extended by court order or with the consent of the parties 
in practice  complying with a formal request can take a significant amount of time 
in addition  if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  then the parties frequently engage in lengthy discussions or negotiations with the investigating agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues  including but not limited to persuading the agency that the proposed acquisition would not violate the antitrust laws  restructuring the proposed acquisition  divestiture of other assets of one or more parties  or abandonment of the transaction 
such discussions and negotiations can be time consuming  and the parties may agree to delay completion of the acquisition during their pendency 
at any time before or after the completion of a proposed acquisition  the federal trade commission or the department of justice could take such action under the antitrust laws as it considers necessary or desirable in the public interest  including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or other assets we own 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act may be investigated by the federal trade commission or the department of justice under the antitrust laws before or after completion 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
we received early termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino act for the pending acquisition of bloomington broadcasting holdings  inc and the pending acquisition of radio stations from broadcasting partners holdings  lp we are awaiting termination of the applicable waiting period for the pending acquisition of stations in michigan from liggett broadcast  inc and certain of its affiliates 
in february  we received a request for additional information and documents from the department of justice relating to stations in saginaw bay city midland  michigan 
as discussed above  this request extends the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act for a period of days after receipt by the department of justice of the information and documents requested from all parties from whom such information and documents have been requested 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act could violate the hart scott rodino act 
in connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act  we will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under a local marketing agreement or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated 
we received a civil investigative demand from the antitrust division of the department of justice addressing our acquisition of krst fm in albuquerque  new mexico 
this matter remains open 
see the discussion below under the heading risk factors and in item  legal proceedings 
trademarks we own a number of trademarks and service marks  including the federally registered marks cat country  supertalk and the cat country logo 
we also own a number of marks registered in various states 
we consider such trademarks and service marks to be important to our business 
see the discussion above under the heading operating strategy and the subheading targeted programming 
seasonality our revenue varies throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue  and the fourth quarter generally produces the highest revenue 
environmental matters as the owner  lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
historically  compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business 
there can be no assurance  however  that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds 
employees at march   we employed approximately  persons 
none of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
we employ several on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets 
we generally enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of one of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share  but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
risk factors any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us or which may adversely affect our business 
substantial indebtedness our debt service consumes a substantial portion of the cash we generate and reduces the cash available to invest in our operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
our large amount of debt could significantly impact our business because  among other things  it requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest expense  which reduces funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  limits our ability to obtain additional financing  if we need it  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other purposes  inhibits our ability to compete with competitors who are less leveraged than we are  and restrains our ability to react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
as of december   we had outstanding total debt of approximately million  excluding the discount on citadel broadcasting s senior subordinated notes due and its senior subordinated notes due  citadel broadcasting s exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million  and shareholders equity of approximately million 
for more information about our indebtedness  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
ability to service debt in order to service our debt  we require a significant amount of cash 
however  our ability to generate cash depends on many factors which are beyond our control 
prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  will affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
if in the future we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations  we may need to refinance our debt  obtain additional financing  delay planned acquisitions and capital expenditures or sell assets 
any of these actions could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow or be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy our debt service requirements 
restrictions imposed on us by our debt instruments our existing debt instruments contain restrictions and limitations which could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and the value of our common stock 
the covenants in citadel broadcasting s credit facility and the agreements governing its other outstanding debt and preferred stock restrict  among other things  citadel broadcasting s ability to incur additional debt  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets or merge or consolidate 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in the credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  the lenders under the credit facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged the outstanding shares of common stock of citadel broadcasting owned by us to secure our guarantee of the credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility are accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets will be sufficient to repay amounts due under the credit facility and other outstanding debt obligations 
the credit facility requires citadel broadcasting to obtain its banks consent before making capital expenditures that exceed the amount permitted by the credit facility and before making acquisitions that do not meet applicable tests under the credit facility 
the credit facility also requires citadel broadcasting to maintain specific financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
events beyond our control could affect citadel broadcasting s ability to meet those financial ratios and condition tests  and we cannot assure you that it will do so 
the indentures governing citadel broadcasting s notes and notes and its credit facility restrict  with certain exceptions  citadel broadcasting s ability to pay dividends on or to repurchase  redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock 
in the event that  after july   cash dividends on citadel broadcasting s exchangeable preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for two or more semi annual dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  holders of the exchangeable preferred stock will be entitled to elect two directors of citadel broadcasting 
this right to elect directors could limit our control over citadel broadcasting  and could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
for more information about our indebtedness  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
history of net losses we have a history of net losses which we expect to continue through at least we had a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for these losses are significant charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisition of radio stations and interest charges on our outstanding debt 
if we acquire additional stations  these charges will probably increase 
we expect to continue to experience net losses through at least limitations on acquisition strategy our strategy to expand our business and increase revenue through acquisitions may fail due to a number of risks involved in implementing this strategy 
we intend to grow by acquiring radio stations in mid sized markets 
however  our acquisition strategy may not increase our cash flow or yield other anticipated benefits because this strategy is subject to a number of other risks  including failure or unanticipated delays in completing acquisitions due to difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval  failure of certain of our acquisitions to prove profitable or for the station or stations acquired to generate cash flow  difficulty in integrating the operations  systems and management of our acquired stations  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  loss of key employees of acquired stations  increases in prices for radio stations due to increased competition for acquisition opportunities  and inability to obtain any required financing for acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all 
we compete and expect to continue to compete with other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we may also find fewer acceptable acquisition opportunities in the future 
in addition  citadel broadcasting s credit facility permits citadel broadcasting to make acquisitions of radio stations without the consent of its banks under the credit facility only if citadel broadcasting maintains the financial ratios and financial condition tests specified in the credit facility 
consequently  we may experience difficulties in pursuing our acquisition strategy 
potential difficulties in completing pending and future transactions due to governmental review antitrust law and other regulatory considerations could prevent or delay our strategy to expand our business and increase revenue 
the completion of several of our pending transactions is  and future transactions we may consider will likely be  subject to the notification filing requirements  applicable waiting periods and possible review by the united states department of justice or the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended 
all of our pending and future radio station acquisitions and dispositions will be subject to the license transfer approval process of the federal communications commission 
review by the department of justice or the federal trade commission may cause delays in completing transactions and  in some cases  result in attempts by these agencies to prevent completion of transactions or negotiate modifications to the proposed terms 
review by the fcc  particularly review of concentration of market revenue share  may also cause delays in completing transactions 
any delay  prohibition or modification could adversely affect the terms of a proposed transaction or could require us to abandon an otherwise attractive opportunity 
for a discussion of the delays we are experiencing in connection with some of our pending acquisitions because of department of justice review and the fcc s license transfer approval process  see pending transactions above 
importance of certain markets a downturn in any of our key markets could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
our albuquerque  providence  salt lake city  little rock  modesto and colorado springs markets are particularly important for our financial well being 
a significant decline in net broadcasting revenue from our stations in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
to illustrate  our radio stations in these markets generated the following percentages of our total net broadcasting revenue and broadcast cash flow in market of net broadcasting revenue of broadcast cash flow albuquerque providence salt lake city little rock modesto colorado springs in  we received a civil investigative demand from the department of justice concerning our acquisition of all of the assets of krst fm in albuquerque  new mexico on october  the demand requested written answers to interrogatories and the production of documents concerning the radio station market in albuquerque  in general  and the krst acquisition  in particular  to enable the department of justice to determine  among other things  whether the krst acquisition would result in excessive concentration in the market 
we responded to the demand 
the department of justice requested supplemental information in  to which we also responded 
this matter remains open 
if the department of justice were to proceed with and successfully challenge the krst acquisition  we may be required to divest one or more radio stations in albuquerque 
see item  legal proceedings 
significant competition in our industry because the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive  we may lose audience share and advertising revenue 
our radio stations face heavy competition from other radio stations in each market for audience share and advertising revenue 
we also compete with other media such as television  newspapers  direct mail and outdoor advertising for advertising revenue 
a decrease in either audience share or advertising revenue could result in decreased cash flow  which could impair our ability to  among other things  service our debt obligations  and which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
the radio broadcasting industry is also facing competition from new media technologies that are being developed such as the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcasting satellite systems and other digital audio broadcasting formats  satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which could result in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  and in band on channel digital radio  which could provide digital radio services in the same frequency range currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services 
we cannot predict either the extent to which such competition will materialize or  if such competition materializes  the extent of its effect on our business 
the internet has also created a new form of competition 
extensive regulation of our industry the federal communications commission s extensive regulation of the radio broadcasting industry limits our ability to own and operate radio stations and other media outlets 
licenses 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of  as amended 
issuance  renewal or transfer of radio broadcast station operating licenses requires fcc approval  and we cannot operate our radio stations without fcc licenses 
the failure to renew our licenses could prevent us from operating the affected stations and generating revenue from them 
if the fcc decides to include conditions or qualifications in any of our licenses  we may be limited in the manner in which we may operate the affected station 
for a discussion of radio licensing  see the discussion above in this item under the heading federal regulation of radio broadcasting and the subheading license grant and renewal 
ownership 
the communications act and fcc rules impose specific limits on the number of stations and other media outlets an entity can own in a single market 
the fcc attributes interests held by  among others  an entity s officers  directors and stockholders to that entity for purposes of applying these ownership limitations 
the existing ownership rules or proposed new rules could affect our acquisition strategy because they may prevent us from acquiring additional stations in a particular market 
we may also be prevented from engaging in a swap transaction if the swap would cause the other company to violate these rules 
for a more detailed discussion of these ownership limitations and their impact on our business  see the discussion above in this item under the heading federal regulation of radio broadcasting and the subheading ownership matters 
item properties the types of properties required to support each of our radio stations include offices  studios  transmitter sites and antenna sites 
a station s studios are generally housed with its offices in business districts 
the transmitter sites and antenna sites are generally located so as to provide maximum market coverage 
we currently own studio facilities and transmitter and antenna sites in various locations 
we expect to acquire additional real estate in connection with our pending acquisitions 
we lease our remaining studio and office facilities  including office space in las vegas  nevada and wexford  pennsylvania which is not related to the operations of a particular station  and we lease our remaining transmitter and antenna sites 
we do not anticipate any difficulties in renewing any facility leases or in leasing alternative or additional space  if required 
we own substantially all of our other equipment  consisting principally of transmitting antennae  transmitters  studio equipment and general office equipment 
no one property is material to our operations 
we believe that our properties are generally in good condition and suitable for our operations 
nonetheless  we continually look for opportunities to upgrade our properties and intend to upgrade studios  office space and transmission facilities in several markets 
substantially all of our properties and equipment serve as collateral for citadel broadcasting s obligations under its credit facility 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
item legal proceedings we currently and from time to time are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business  but we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which  in our opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
we received civil investigative demands from the department of justice pursuant to which the department of justice requested information from us to determine whether we violated particular antitrust laws 
one investigative demand was issued on september  and concerns our acquisition of all of the assets of krst fm in albuquerque  new mexico on october  the demand requested written answers to interrogatories and the production of documents concerning the radio station market in albuquerque  in general  and the krst acquisition  in particular  to enable the department of justice to determine  among other things  whether the krst acquisition would result in excessive concentration in the market 
we responded to the demand 
the department of justice requested supplemental information on january   to which we also responded 
this matter remains open 
if the department of justice were to proceed with and successfully challenge the krst acquisition  we may be required to divest one or more radio stations in albuquerque 
item submission of matters to vote of security holders no matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report 
part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the only outstanding common equity of citadel communications is its common stock  par value 
per share 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol citc 
public trading of our common stock began on july  the high and low closing prices per share for our common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market during and were as follows high low quarter ended september quarter ended december high low quarter ended march quarter ended june quarter ended september quarter ended december on march   there were  outstanding shares of our common stock and there were approximately record holders of our common stock 
however  we believe the number of beneficial owners is significantly greater 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
additionally  the terms of citadel broadcasting s credit facility prohibit citadel communications from declaring or paying any such cash dividends without consent of the lenders under the facility 
declaration or payment of future permitted dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  operating results  current and anticipated cash needs and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
the terms of the various documents governing citadel broadcasting s indebtedness and its exchangeable preferred stock impose significant restrictions on the payment of dividends and the making of loans by citadel broadcasting to citadel communications 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
because we are a holding company  we do not have any other source from which to pay cash dividends on our common stock

in addition  citadel broadcasting owns and operates an internet service provider  offering its subscribers a variety of services  including electronic mail and access to the internet 
in december  citadel broadcasting decided to discontinue its internet service operations 
general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results 
from time to time the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
however  we believe that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 
in addition  our financial results are also dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
in the following analysis  we discuss our broadcast cash flow 
the performance of a radio station group is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the two components of broadcast cash flow are gross revenue  net of agency commissions  and operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses and non cash and non recurring charges 
broadcast cash flow assists in comparing performance on a consistent basis across companies without regard to depreciation and amortization  which can vary significantly depending on accounting methods  particularly when acquisitions are involved 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  consist of operating income loss before depreciation and amortization 
although broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we believe that they are useful to an investor in evaluating our company because they are measures widely used in the broadcasting industry to evaluate a radio company s operating performance 
however  broadcast cash flow and ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of liquidity or profitability 
the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
as a result  our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations charge 
correspondingly  the rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels  and the resulting ratings  is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
each of our stations has a general pre determined level of on air inventory that it makes available for advertising  which may be different at different times of the day and tends to remain stable over time 
much of our selling activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by changing the available inventory 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services  such as other media advertising  travel or lodging  in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve most of our on air inventory for cash advertising  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have generally sold over of our advertising time for cash  although this percentage may fluctuate by quarter 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising announcements paid for in cash with advertising announcements paid for in trade 
we include trade or barter amounts in our net broadcasting revenue 
our revenue varies throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenue  and the fourth quarter generally produces the highest revenue 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of radio stations include employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
we also incur  and will continue to incur  significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and anticipated future acquisitions of stations  and existing and future borrowings 
in december  we decided to discontinue the operations of our internet service provider 
as a result of this decision  we have adopted a plan for the disposition by sale of the internet service provider 
this plan includes the sale of subscribers and all related internet equipment 
we are currently in negotiations with other internet service providers and anticipate finalizing the sale by the end of the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the sale will be completed as anticipated 
our internet service provider recorded gross revenue and net income loss of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the operations of the internet service provider have been segregated and presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss for from discontinued operations includes an estimate of operational losses for of approximately million 
in  our radio stations derived approximately of their net broadcasting revenue from local and regional advertising in the markets in which they operate  and the remainder resulted principally from the sale of national advertising 
local and regional advertising is sold primarily by each station s sales staff 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage a national advertising representative firm 
we believe that the volume of national advertising revenue tends to adjust to shifts in a station s audience share position more rapidly than does the volume of local and regional advertising revenue 
therefore  we focus on sales of local and regional advertising 
during the year ended december  and  no single advertiser accounted for more than of our net broadcasting revenue 
our advertising revenue is typically collected within days of the date on which the related advertisement is aired 
most accrued expenses  however  are paid within to days 
as a result of this time lag  working capital requirements have increased as we have grown and will likely increase in the future 
historically  we have generated net losses primarily as a result of significant charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisition of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
we amortize fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to the acquisition of radio stations over a year period 
based upon the large number of acquisitions that were consummated within the last two years  we anticipate that depreciation and amortization charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our depreciation and amortization charges are likely to increase 
we expect that we will continue to incur net losses through at least we consolidate the operations of stations operated under local marketing agreements 
the emerging issues task force is reviewing the accounting method for contractual management arrangements and may determine that consolidation is appropriate only if certain requirements for controlling financial interest are met 
because the provisions of our existing local marketing agreement do not meet the proposed control requirements  if the emerging issues task force proposal is approved as drafted  consolidation of the station operated under the local marketing agreement may no longer be appropriate 
results of operations our consolidated financial statements tend not to be directly comparable from period to period due to acquisition activity 
our acquisitions during the year ended december  and  all of which have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of which have been included since the date of acquisition  were as follows acquisitions and dispositions

recent liquidity needs have been driven by our acquisition strategy 
our principal liquidity requirements are for acquisition financing  debt service  working capital and general and corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
our acquisition strategy has required  and is expected to continue in the foreseeable future to require  a significant portion of our capital resources 
we expect that our debt service within the next twelve months  without regard to future acquisitions  will be approximately million  including approximately million for interest on citadel broadcasting s senior subordinated notes due and senior subordinated notes due and approximately million for interest on citadel broadcasting s credit facility 
citadel broadcasting s exchangeable preferred stock does not require cash dividends through july  citadel broadcasting redeemed approximately of the exchangeable preferred stock in august of we have financed our past acquisitions through bank borrowings  sales of equity and debt securities  internally generated funds and proceeds from asset sales 
we expect that financing for future acquisitions will be provided from the same sources 
an important factor in management financing decisions is the maintenance of leverage ratios consistent with our long term growth strategy 
we recognize that we may require additional resources or may need to consider modifications to our expansion plans 
to the extent we are unable to obtain additional funding  as needed  we have contingency plans  which include curtailing capital expenditure activities  and reducing infrastructure costs associated with expansion and development plans 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital  as needed  achieving profitable results or entering into new markets

the proceeds to us from the offering  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  were approximately million

pending acquisitions and recently completed transactions 
there are numerous transactions currently pending which  if completed  would result in our purchasing fm and am radio stations  acquiring the right to operate one additional fm radio station  acquiring the right to sell advertising in the united states for one canadian fm radio station and selling two am radio stations 
the total cash required to fund our pending acquisitions is expected to be approximately million  which amount does not include  shares of our common stock valued at million that may be delivered in connection with one acquisition 
under certain conditions  we may be required to pay the million in cash in lieu of such shares of common stock 
in addition  we purchased one fm radio station on february   and we sold fm and seven am radio stations on november  we received approximately million in cash from the completed disposition  however  the cash received from this sale plus accrued interest must be utilized as part of the purchase price for one of our pending acquisitions as we have elected to enter into a like kind exchange for federal income tax purposes 
the consummation of each of the pending transactions is subject to certain conditions  including the approval of the fcc 
although we believe these closing conditions will be satisfied in each case  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
the pending acquisitions are expected to be funded from funds borrowed under citadel broadcasting s credit facility  the funds received from the completed disposition and the proceeds received from the recently completed offering of our common stock 
capital expenditures 
we had capital expenditures of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million in this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of a corporate jet  furniture and fixtures related to the relocation of our corporate offices  the purchase of new digital automation systems for certain markets and the construction of a new building in little rock  arkansas 
our other equipment purchases consist primarily of broadcasting equipment and transmission tower upgrades 
in addition to acquisitions and debt service  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  which are not expected to be material in amount 
we believe that cash from operating activities  loans under citadel broadcasting s credit facility  proceeds from the november  disposition and the proceeds from our recently completed offering of our common stock should be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations and to fund our operations  including completion of our pending acquisitions  for at least the next months  although additional capital resources may be required in connection with any further implementation of our acquisition strategy 
year matters 
the year computer issue primarily results from the fact that information technology hardware and software systems and other non information technology products containing embedded microchip processors were originally programmed using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
such programming could cause a system or product failure or other computer errors and a disruption in the operation of such systems and products 
the year issue may persist for some time after january our internal systems have not experienced any material year issues 
we presently believe that year issues will not pose significant operational problems for our business going forward 
we continue to monitor our operations for year issues  and we believe that any year problems  which may arise in our internal systems  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
we are not aware of any material year problems encountered by our suppliers and major advertisers to date  but have not obtained or sought confirmations from our suppliers and major advertisers that they did not experience year problems 
further  we cannot determine the state of their year readiness on a going forward basis 
we cannot assure you that our suppliers and major advertisers will be successful in ensuring that their systems have been and will continue to be year compliant or that their failure to do so will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we constantly assess these risks and have established policies and practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future 
interest rate risk 
we may be exposed to interest rate changes under citadel broadcasting s credit facility  which we maintain to provide liquidity and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we constantly monitor interest rate changes to determine the impact any change will have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short term maturities 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
citadel broadcasting s credit facility bears interest equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate 
for further discussion of citadel broadcasting s interest rate under the credit facility  see item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading credit facility 
citadel broadcasting s credit facility consists of revolving loans and term loans 
the revolving loans mature on march  subject to extension until december  
the term loans are subject to quarterly principle repayments starting in march and ending december the quarterly repayments are based on a percentage of the term loan borrowings and the percentage ranges from in to in at december   there was million outstanding under the revolving term loan facility at an interest rate of 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the interest rate of  the impact on our future earnings for the next year would be approximately million of increased interest expense based on million of outstanding variable debt 
in addition  the credit facility requires that no less than of citadel broadcasting s long term indebtedness be subject to fixed interest rates 
if citadel broadcasting s total variable debt under the credit facility exceeds this threshold  citadel broadcasting will be required to enter into a hedging contract that will convert a portion of the variable rate into a fixed rate 
as of december   citadel broadcasting s fixed rate debt is greater than of its outstanding indebtedness and therefore citadel broadcasting has not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts
