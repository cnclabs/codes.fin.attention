the company continues to emphasize customer satisfaction and expanding those laboratory services which offer the greatest benefit to patients  clinicians  and the company 
the areas of particular growth emphasis are higher margin esoteric testing  genetic testing  oncology testing and infectious disease testing 
approximately million in annual revenue comes from specialty testing generated through the company s center for esoteric testing in burlington  and the center for molecular biology and pathology cmbp  in research triangle park 
annual revenue for the center for esoteric testing is around million annually  and growing at about per year 
the annual revenue for cmbp is approximately million  with a number of test categories growing at an annual rate of about 
medically advanced infectious disease testing represented approximately million in revenues in the company expects medically advance infectious disease volume growth in the near term of annually 
this volume growth is anticipated to come primarily from hiv and hepatitus c testing 
hiv resistance testing has recently received strong support from the fda s antiretroviral advisory committee for use in drug development 
resistance testing has also received strong support by the department of health and human services panel on clinical practices for treatment of hiv infection for use in clinical practice 
the company is currently the only laboratory with a historical database of multiple viral load and resistance tests on the same patient information that has high value in the management of hiv 
genetic testing is primarily performed at cmbp  and represented approximately million in cmbp revenue at the end of the company expects volume growth over the next several years to be about annually 
demand for molecular genetic tests has doubled over the past year 
company wide  oncology testing  including pathology  tumor markers and molecular oncology  represented in excess of million in revenue in oncology testing has high growth potential  with increased demand for oncology testing anticipated once more therapies and tests for cancer are available 
the company will continue to add new  higher margin tests  such as those for cervical cancer like monolayer pap and hpv testing 
the company s national presence  the volume of testing performed and its expertise as a technology leader permits it to be one of the first labs in the country to offer new tests  helping to quickly increase awareness of new diagnostic tools 
overall  the company expects its current performance trends to continue into consolidated revenues are forecast to increase by to  with operating expenses increasing between to 
the effective income tax rate is forecasted to be approximately for the company plans to continue increasing connectivity with customers through test ordering and result receiving products such as the labcorp communication manager software  and through external alliances  such as the recently announced agreements with healtheon webmd  aht corporation  and proxymed  all e commerce health care companies 
recent strategic alliances with kingston and benedictine hospitals in new york state  mcallen medical center hospital and edinburg regional medical center in texas  and more than statewide sites of the florida health department and county clinics  are benefiting from the company s state of the art information network that provide clients access to emergin technology sooner 
during the year  the clinical trials testing business of the company opened a full service laboratory in belgium  in order to service the global pharmaceutical industry 
the company s industry continues to be affected by significant government regulation  price competition and increased influence of managed care organizations 
many market based changes in the clinical laboratory business have occurred  most involving the shift away from traditional  fee for service medicine to managed cost health care 
the growth of the managed care sector has presented various challenges to the company and other independent clinical laboratories such as increased discounts and the use of capitated payment contracts 
these practices have negatively impacted the company s operating margins 
of the us population and of employees are members of managed care plans 
however  recent trends indicate that membership in restrictive hmo plans has peaked  with enrollment expected to shift into plans offering more patient provider choice  such as preferred provider organizations and point of service models 
as a result  the company is experiencing better pricing and improved margins on its managed care business 
during  the company s revenue from capitated payment contracts decreased by million  to million  while total revenue from all managed care contracts increased by million  to a total of million

seasonality volume of testing generally declines during the summer months  year end holiday periods and other major holidays  resulting in net revenues and cash flows in the third and fourth quarters below the annual average

this increase was offset by a decline in sales as a result of lower testing volume  resulting from industry wide trends as well as the company s program of selectively eliminating unprofitable accounts and carefully evaluating the acceptability of new business 
cost of sales  which includes primarily laboratory and distribution costs  was  million for compared to  million in the corresponding period  a decrease of 
cost of sales decreased approximately million due to a decrease in testing supplies  approximately million due to the decrease in volume  and approximately million due to a decrease in consulting fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries due to scheduled salary increases as well as the michigan and delaware acquisitions 
the reduction in testing supplies is the result of ongoing efforts by the company to consolidate suppliers and inventory item usage 
there can be no assurance that the company can achieve this level of reduction in the future

with the completion of the conversion of the long island  northern virginia and michigan facilities  approximately of the company s billings are performed on the company s centralized system 
by the end of the year  management anticipates that approximately of billings will be performed on that system with the remainder converted during the billing system conversions  combined with improvements in front end processes  that enhance data capture for billing  are expected to reduce dso to approximately days by the end of and the mid s by the end of the company expects that these conversions will lower dso and have a positive impact on the timing of cash collections
