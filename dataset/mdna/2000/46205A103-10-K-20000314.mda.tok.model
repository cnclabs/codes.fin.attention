in connection with its anticipated migration to digital broadcast facilities  the company is evaluating the remaining useful lives and residual values of the equipment which would be affected by such migration 
the company anticipates that its evaluation of useful lives as described above will result in a decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of the affected assets and  as a result  accelerate the depreciation of such assets 
the company will account for this change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis 
the company s operating data throughout the periods discussed have been affected significantly by the timing and mix of television station acquisitions throughout such periods and the costs incurred to launch and support pax tv 
the company s primary operating costs include commissions on revenues  employee salaries  administrative expenses  and payments with respect to syndicated program rights  cable distribution  ratings services and promotional advertising 
the company s business is subject to various risks and uncertainties which may significantly reduce revenues and increase operating expenses 
for example  a reduction in expenditures by television advertisers in the company s markets may result in lower revenues 
the company may be unable to reduce expenses  including syndicated program rights fees and certain variable expenses  in an amount sufficient in the short term to offset lost revenues caused by poor market conditions 
the broadcasting industry continues to undergo rapid technological change  which may increase competition within the company s markets as new delivery systems  such as direct broadcast satellite and computer networks  attract customers 
the changing nature of audience tastes and viewing habits may affect the continued attractiveness of the company s broadcasting stations to advertisers upon whom the company is dependent for its revenue 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount contingent or otherwise of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates

the company is also subject to certain minimum liquidity requirements under the terms of the equipment facility 
in september  the company issued shares of series b convertible preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants to nbc for gross proceeds of million 
the company believes that its available cash balances will provide it with sufficient liquidity to fund its capital requirements through the year the fcc has mandated that each licensee of a full power broadcast tv station  which was allotted a second digital television channel in addition to the current analog channel  complete the build out of its digital broadcast service by may despite the current uncertainty that exists in the broadcasting industry with respect to standards for digital broadcast services  planned formats and usage  it is the company s intention to comply with the fcc s timing requirements for the broadcast of digital television 
the company has already commenced migration to digital broadcasting in certain of its markets and will continue to do so throughout its required time period 
due to such uncertainty with respect to standards  formats and usage  however  the company cannot currently predict with reasonable certainty the amount it will likely have to spend in aggregate to complete the digital conversion of its stations  but does anticipate spending at least million 
it is likely that the capital necessary to complete the digital conversion will come from cash on hand as well as the monetization of certain assets and the potential incurrence of additional indebtedness 
year considerations the year issue was the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four digits to identify the applicable year 
as of december   however  all of the company s critical systems were year compliant and functioned properly 
the company experienced no disruption to business from either internal or external year issues
