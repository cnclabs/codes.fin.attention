item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company believes it is a leading manufacturer of fabricated wire products  industrial wire and carbon steel rod for the agricultural  industrial  construction  original equipment manufacturer and retail consumer markets and believes it is the third largest manufacturer of fabricated wire products and industrial wire in the united states based on tons shipped  in 
keystone s operations benefit from vertical integration as the company s mini mill supplies carbon steel rod produced from scrap steel to its downstream fabricated wire products and industrial wire operations 
these downstream fabrication operations accounted for of net sales 
the company s fabricated wire products typically yield higher and less volatile gross margins compared to rod 
management believes keystone s fabricated wire businesses insulate it better than other rod producers from the effects of rod imports and new domestic rod production capacity 
moreover  the company s rod production costs have generally been below the market price for rod providing a significant cost advantage over wire producers who purchase rod as a raw material 
during december  the company substantially completed a two year million capital improvements plan to upgrade certain of its plant and equipment and eliminate production capacity bottlenecks in order to reduce costs and improve production efficiency 
the principal components of keystone s capital improvements plan included reconfiguring its electric arc furnace  replacing its billet caster and upgrading its wire and rod mills 
as a result of these capital improvements  beginning in  the company expected to increase its annual billet production capacity to million tons from  tons 
however  during  keystone experienced production problems related to the start up of the new equipment 
keystone believes it has identified the start up problems and expects to have these problems resolved and the equipment performing at the desired levels during the first quarter 
in addition  although keystone s new billet production capacity will be million tons  the company is presently limited by its illinois environmental protection agency construction permit to annual billet production of  tons 
keystone has applied for modifications to its permit to allow production of the million ton capacity and expects to have that permit approved by september  the company s steel making operations  together with billet purchases of  tons and  tons in and  respectively  provided  tons and  tons of billets in and  respectively 
the current estimated annual production capacity of the company s rod mill is  tons 
the higher billet production and purchase volumes in  resulted in rod production increasing from  tons of estimated capacity in to  tons of estimated capacity 
despite the potential increase in billet production capacity to million tons  keystone s rod production is constrained by the  ton capacity of its rod mill 
the company anticipates any excess billet production will be sold externally 
keystone s estimated current fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity is  tons 
utilization of the company s annual fabricated wire products and industrial wire production capacity aggregated in  in and in in november  the company entered into a joint venture agreement and formed engineered wire products  inc ewp with keystone owning a equity interest in ewp 
in december  keystone purchased the of ewp not already owned by keystone the ewp acquisition 
as part of the joint venture agreement  keystone supplied ewp with the majority of ewp s rod requirements 
ewp then converted the rod to fabricated wire products which were primarily used in the concrete pipe and road construction businesses 
during  keystone shipped  tons of rod to ewp 
as a result of the acquisition of ewp  keystone was able to convert its lower margin rod sales to ewp  into higher margin fabricated wire product sales 
this change in product mix between and resulted in a decline in overall fabricated wire product selling prices as ewp s fabricated wire products sell for lower prices than do keystone s other fabricated wire products 
the company s profitability is dependent in large part on its ability to utilize effectively its production capacity  which is affected by the availability of raw material  plant efficiency and other production factors and to control its manufacturing costs  which are comprised primarily of raw materials  energy and labor costs 
keystone s primary raw material is scrap steel 
the price of scrap steel is highly volatile and scrap steel prices are affected by periodic shortages  freight costs  weather and other conditions largely beyond the control of the company 
scrap prices can vary widely from period to period 
the average per ton price paid for scrap by the company was in  in and in keystone s product selling prices cannot always be adjusted  especially in the short term  to recover the costs of any increases in scrap prices 
the domestic steel rod industry continues to experience consolidation 
in addition  worldwide overcapacity in the steel industry continues to exist and imports of rod and certain wire products in recent years have increased significantly 
in an effort to stem increasing levels of imported rod  in december  keystone  joined by six other companies representing more than of the market  and a labor union petitioned the us international trade commission the itc seeking relief under section of the trade act of during the second quarter  the itc recommended president clinton impose a tariff on all foreign rod imports except for those from canada  mexico and certain other countries covered under trade acts 
in february  the president announced the implementation of a tariff rate quota trq for three years 
the tariff will be imposed on wire rod imports from countries subject to the trq once imports initially exceed million net tons 
this level will be increased by two percent in years two and three 
the tariff rate will be in the first year  in the second year and in the third year 
the company does not anticipate that the trq will have a major impact on the industry 
keystone consumes a significant amount of energy in its manufacturing operations and  accordingly  its profitability can also be adversely affected by the volatility in the price of coal  oil and natural gas resulting in increased energy  transportation  freight  scrap and supply costs 
the company purchases electrical energy for its peoria  illinois facility from a utility under an interruptible service contract which provides for more economical electricity rates but allows the utility to refuse or interrupt power to its manufacturing facilities 
the utility has in the past  and may in the future  refuse or interrupt service to keystone resulting in decreased production and increased costs associated with the related downtime 
in addition  the utility has the right to pass through certain of its costs to consumers through fuel adjustment charges 
during the third quarter  the company received an unexpected million fuel adjustment charge from the peoria plant s electricity provider 
the utility may in the future bill the company for additional fuel adjustment charges 
the company was previously engaged in the manufacture and packaging of household cleaning products through the joliet division of its subsidiary desoto  inc in january  desoto sold such operations 
beginning in  keystone is also engaged in the marketing and distribution of wire  wood and plastic products to the consumer lawn and garden market  and the operation of a scrap recycling facility 
these operations were insignificant when compared to the consolidated operations of the company 
as such  the results of their operations are not separately addressed in the discussion that follows 
results of operations the following table sets forth keystone s steel and wire production and sales volume data for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in thousands of tons production volume billets produced purchased carbon steel rod sales volume fabricated wire products industrial wire carbon steel rod the following table sets forth the components of the company s net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in millions steel and wire products fabricated wire products industrial wire carbon steel rod other lawn and garden products household cleaning products the following table sets forth selected operating data of keystone as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expense overfunded defined benefit pension credit income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes 
net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales declined in from due primarily to a decline in overall steel and wire product selling prices and a decline in volume 
during  fabricated wire products represented of net sales as compared to in  industrial wire declined to of net sales in as compared to in  and carbon steel rod sales in  as a percentage of net sales  were unchanged from the level at 
the decline in overall product selling prices per ton adversely impacted net sales by million 
fabricated wire products selling prices increased while shipments declined in as compared to industrial wire selling prices declined in when compared to while shipments declined 
carbon steel rod selling prices declined while shipments increased as compared to gross profit declined approximately to million in from million in gross margin declined to from in as lower scrap costs  keystone s primary raw material  were more than offset by lower overall selling prices  and higher production costs 
the higher production costs were due primarily to increased costs associated with the start up of the company s capital projects that were completed during  weather related issues in the first quarter of  purchased billet costs  a million charge due to a change in the manner in which vacation time was earned for employees covered by a new labor union contract at the company s peoria facility  an unexpected million fuel adjustment charge from the peoria plant s electricity provider and a million charge in connection with the write off of certain production equipment at the peoria facility 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain infrastructure related equipment would need to be replaced at the end of the year as a result of the start up of certain capital projects  and keystone charged the equipment s remaining net book value to depreciation expense in in addition  keystone recorded a million benefit during as a result of favorable legal settlements with certain electrode vendors related to alleged price fixing 
the company received similar settlements in totaling million and does not anticipate it will receive any further electrode settlements 
keystone believes the start up issues related to new equipment have been identified and that these issues will be resolved and the equipment performing at the desired levels by the end of the first quarter of however  the company believes these problems will continue to adversely impact earnings during the first quarter of keystone s scrap costs declined during as compared to during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  at an average price of per ton 
keystone expects average scrap costs in will exceed average costs 
the company also purchased  tons of billets during at an average cost of per ton as compared to  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton 
keystone does not anticipate purchasing any billets during selling expenses increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the higher selling expenses associated with the company s lawn and garden products segment 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher general insurance expense  costs associated with the start up of the company s lawn and garden products segment  unfavorable legal settlements and higher environmental charges 
in addition  included a legal fee reimbursement of  during  keystone recorded a non cash pension credit of million as compared to million in the lower pension credit was primarily the result of increased pension benefits included in the company s may labor contract with the peoria facility s union 
the company currently estimates  for financial reporting purposes  that it will recognize a non cash pension credit of approximately million in and  does not anticipate cash contributions for defined benefit pension plan fundings will be required in however  future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases in pension expense or credit and future funding requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense during was higher than due principally to higher borrowing levels partially offset by lower interest rates 
average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facilities  ewp term loan and senior secured notes approximated million during as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by the company was per annum as compared to per annum in at december   the company s financial statements reflected total accrued liabilities of million to cover estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
although keystone has established an accrual for estimated future required environmental remediation costs  there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
the principal reasons for the difference between the us federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s deferred tax position at december  is also explained in note to the consolidated financial statements and in liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of the items discussed above  keystone incurred a net loss of million during as compared to net income in of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased in from during  fabricated wire products represented of net sales as compared to in  industrial wire declined to of net sales in as compared to in  and carbon steel rod comprised of net sales as compared to in the primary reason for the change in product mix was the ewp acquisition in december keystone supplied ewp with the majority of ewp s rod requirements prior to the acquisition 
as a result of the ewp acquisition those sales are now reflected as sales of fabricated wire products 
fabricated wire products selling prices declined while shipments increased in as compared to the primary reason for the decline in fabricated wire product selling prices during was the ewp acquisition 
ewp s fabricated wire products sell for lower overall prices than do the remainder of the company s fabricated wire products 
industrial wire prices remained relatively level in as compared to prices while shipments declined 
carbon steel rod selling prices declined during as compared to while shipments declined 
the decline in rod shipments to external customers was due primarily to the ewp acquisition and an increase in low cost imported rod during gross profit declined approximately to million in from million in gross margin declined to from in as higher production costs more than offset higher overall selling prices and lower scrap costs 
the higher production costs were due primarily to a new electrical supply contract at the company s facility in peoria  illinois  unplanned equipment outages during the first quarter  power interruptions during the second quarter and increased costs associated with the start up of the company s capital projects that were completed during the third and fourth quarters of during  the company purchased  tons of scrap at an average price of per ton as compared to purchases of  tons at an average price of per ton 
the company purchased  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton as compared to  tons of billets in at an average price of per ton 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
during  keystone recorded a non cash pension credit of million as compared to approximately million in on august  keystone issued million of senior secured notes the senior notes 
as such  interest expense in was significantly higher than average borrowings by the company under its revolving credit facilities  term loans and the senior notes amounted to approximately million in as compared to million in during  the average interest rate paid by keystone under these debt agreements was per annum as compared to in keystone used million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to repay borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and to retire amounts outstanding under the company s term loan 
the effective tax rates in and were and  respectively 
as a result of the items discussed above  net income during declined to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of sales to from 
outlook for keystone believes it has identified the start up problems relative to the new equipment at its peoria  illinois steel mill and expects to have these problems resolved and the equipment performing at the desired levels during the first quarter 
however  the company anticipates these issues will continue to negatively impact first quarter earnings 
management also believes scrap costs during will be higher than in  although  management anticipates it will be able to increase its per ton product selling prices to cover any significant increase in scrap costs 
in addition  management believes that due to expected higher debt levels in  interest expense will also be higher than in as such  operating results during could be adversely impacted and the company may incur a net loss during the first quarter  although management expects the company to be profitable for calendar in addition  management anticipates keystone will receive permits by september  to increase billet production to million tons  and plans to convert these incremental billets  either internally or externally  to carbon steel rod 
sales of this additional carbon steel rod would favorably impact earnings 
liquidity and capital resources at december   keystone had negative working capital of million  including million of notes payable and current maturities of long term debt as well as outstanding borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities of million 
the amount of available borrowings under these revolving credit facilities is based on formula determined amounts of trade receivables and inventories  less the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
under the terms of the indenture related to the senior secured notes  the company s ability to borrow under its revolving credit facilities may be limited 
at december   unused credit available for borrowing under keystone s million revolving credit facility  which expires december   and ewp s million revolving credit facility  which expires june   and garden zone s million revolving credit facility  which expires december   were million  
million and 
million respectively 
the terms of the indenture will permit keystone to borrow all of the million unused credit available under keystone s million revolving credit facility during the first quarter of the company s million revolving credit facility requires daily cash receipts be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which results in the company maintaining zero cash balances when there are balances outstanding under this credit facility 
during  the company s operating activities provided approximately million of cash  compared to million of cash provided by operating activities in in addition to lower earnings in as compared to  cash flow from operations decreased in compared to due to relative changes in the levels of assets and liabilities 
these decreases in cash flow were offset by lower capital expenditures 
during  keystone made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily related to upgrades of production equipment at its facility in peoria  illinois  as compared to million in during  the company commenced a million capital improvement plan to upgrade certain of its plant and equipment and eliminate production capacity bottlenecks in order to reduce costs and improve production efficiency 
keystone substantially completed the capital improvement plan during as such  capital expenditures during were considerably less than capital expenditures during capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be approximately million and are related primarily to upgrades of  as well as additional  production equipment 
these capital expenditures will be funded using borrowing availability under keystone s revolving credit facilities 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected accrued liabilities of million for estimated remediation costs arising from environmental issues 
there is no assurance regarding the ultimate cost of remedial measures that might eventually be required by environmental authorities or that additional environmental hazards  requiring further remedial expenditures  might not be asserted by such authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts accrued 
keystone does not expect to be required to make contributions to its pension plan during future variances from assumed actuarial rates  including the rate of return on pension plan assets  may result in increases or decreases to pension expense or credit and funding requirements in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company incurs significant ongoing costs for plant and equipment and substantial employee medical benefits for both current and retired employees 
as such  keystone is vulnerable to business downturns and increases in costs  and accordingly  routinely compares its liquidity requirements and capital needs against its estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past  and may in the future  reduce controllable costs  modify product mix  acquire and dispose of businesses  restructure certain indebtedness  and raise additional equity capital 
keystone will continue to evaluate the need for similar actions or other measures in the future in order to meet its obligations 
the company also routinely evaluates acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies related to the company s current businesses 
keystone intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company 
however  keystone s ability to incur new debt in the future may be limited by the terms of the indenture related to the senior secured notes 
management believes the cash flows from operations together with available cash and the funds available under the company s revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the anticipated needs of the company s operations and capital improvements for the year ending december  this belief is based upon management s assessment of various financial and operational factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions relating to product shipments  product mix and selling prices  production schedules  productivity rates  raw materials  electricity  labor  employee benefits and other fixed and variable costs  interest rates  repayments of long term debt  capital expenditures  and available borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities 
however  liabilities under environmental laws and regulations with respect to the clean up and disposal of wastes  or any significant increases in the cost of providing medical coverage to active and retired employees could have a material adverse effect on the future liquidity  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
additionally  significant declines in the company s end user markets or market share  the inability to maintain satisfactory billet and rod production levels  or other unanticipated costs  if significant  could result in a need for funds greater than the company currently has available 
there can be no assurance the company would be able to obtain an adequate amount of additional financing

year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain computer programs that had date sensitive software may have recognized a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
over the past few years  the company has spent time  effort and money in order to address the year issue in an attempt to ensure that its computer systems  both information technology it systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology  and software applications would function properly after december  this process included  among other things  the identification of all systems and applications potentially affected by the year issue  the determination of which systems and applications required remediation and the completion thereof and the testing of systems and applications following remediation for year compliance 
in addition  the company requested confirmation from its major software and hardware vendors  suppliers and customers that they were developing and implementing plans to become  or that they had become  year compliant 
contingency plans were also developed to address potential year issues related to business interruption in the event one or more internal systems or the systems of third parties upon which the company relies ultimately proved not to be year compliant 
as part of these contingency plans  the company s steel making facility in peoria  illinois temporarily idled its manufacturing facilities shortly before the end of as an added safeguard against unexpected loss of utility service  and such facilities resumed production shortly after midnight of year end after all of the efforts described above  the company believed its key systems were year compliant prior to december  the amount spent by keystone to address the year issue  excluding the cost of ongoing system upgrades  was not significant 
to date in  none of the company s manufacturing facilities have suffered any downtime due to non compliant systems  nor have any significant problems associated with the year issue been identified in any of such systems 
keystone will continue to monitor its major systems in order to ensure such systems continue to be year compliant 
however  based primarily upon the length of time into which has elapsed without the identification of any significant problems related to the year issue  the company does not currently expect to experience any significant year issue related problems
