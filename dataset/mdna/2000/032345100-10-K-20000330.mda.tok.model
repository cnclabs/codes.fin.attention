the company  through its ongoing reserve analysis  has estimated the benefit to be derived from such agreements and reduced estimates of ultimate losses incurred accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its estimate of such salvage and subrogation recoveries by approximately million which is partially attributable to salvage and subrogation on losses incurred during the fourth quarter

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the main objective in managing the investment portfolios of the company is to maximize total investment returns while minimizing credit risks  in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including expected underwriting results  tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are primarily managed by the company s investment advisors based on guidelines established by management and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to financial instruments of the company primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
since most of the company s property and casualty business is short tailed in nature  the company has established duration guidelines to be commensurate with our liabilities 
our guidelines have established duration of the portfolio to be between years 
the following table provides information about all our fixed maturity investments which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
december  december  estimated there after amortized market cost value dollars in thousands tax exempt        average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities         average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total         prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates than can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within the portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
equity market risk is defined as the chance that market influences will affect the expected returns of all equities 
returns are influenced not only by the fundamental attributes of investment securities  but by the price movements of the general marketplace 
much of this depends on the sensitivity to the overall market of the individual issue 
the company attempts to reduce this risk through diversification and a focus on high quality  blue chip investments
