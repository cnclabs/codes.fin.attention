item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kopin is a leading developer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor materials and miniature displays 
we use our proprietary technology to design  manufacture and market products used in highly demanding commercial wireless communications and high resolution portable applications 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal components of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
historically  product revenues have consisted of sales of our hbt transistor wafers 
for the year ended december   we had product revenues of million  or of total revenues 
for the year ended december   product revenues were million  or of total revenues 
product revenues were million  or of total revenues for the year ended december  we began shipping our cyberdisplay product in this product line represented of our product revenues for the year ended december  research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies of the us government 
for the year ended december   as management intensified its efforts on the marketing and sales of its commercial products  research and development revenues declined to million  or of total revenues 
for the year ended december   research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues for the year ended december  we believe that research and development revenues will continue to decline on an annual basis as a percentage of total revenues for the near future 
we recognize revenues when a product is shipped or when a service is performed 
we typically provide customers with a twelve month warranty from the date of sale for some of our products 
based upon historical and anticipated warranty costs  we account for estimated sales return and warranty reserves in the period the sale is made 
we recognize revenues from long term contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as unearned revenues 
we bill unbilled receivables based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase in product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales of our gallium arsenide products as well as our cyberdisplay products in the year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended gallium arsenide product sales and cyberdisplay product sales were million and million  respectively  versus million and million  respectively  for research and development revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
research and development revenues declined primarily due to the expirations of multi year contracts with the us government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to our products  was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues in primarily is attributable to increased production staffing as we increased production capacity  re deployed certain assets and personnel previously involved in development activities to manufacturing activities and increased sales of our cyberdisplay products as a percentage of total sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses are incurred under development programs for gallium arsenide and display products either in support of internal development programs or programs funded by agencies of the us government 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
funded research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or due to reduced subcontractor expenses caused by the expiration of multi year contracts with agencies of the us government 
internal research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in  a decrease million  or 
the decrease in internal research and development was primarily a result of the re deployment of certain assets and personnel from development activities into manufacturing activities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to increases in headcount in the sales and marketing staff and significant travel associated with new customer support 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include non cash charges for compensation expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in  relating to the issuance of certain stock options 
other 
other expenses  primarily amortization of patents and licenses  were  for the year ended december  compared to  in other income  net 
other income  net was million for the year ended december  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of reduced debt 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
our total revenues were million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
our product revenues were million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in product revenues was primarily due to an increase in sales of our gallium arsenide products as well as our cyberdisplay product sales for the year ended december  versus december  gallium arsenide product sales and cyberdisplay product sales were million and million for the year ended  respectively  versus million and million in the increase in sales of our gallium arsenide products hbt wafers was primarily due to the increased use of our advanced semiconductor transistors in various wireless telecommunications products  particularly by our major customer  conexant 
research and development revenues were million for compared to million in  an increase of  the increase in research and development revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in contract revenues from agencies of the us government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues was million for compared to million in included in cost of product revenues is a charge totaling approximately million associated with the write down of inventory resulting from modification of certain processes in the production of our cyberdisplay products to improve manufacturing flexibility and to meet customer requirements 
excluding this inventory write down  cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of product revenues because of manufacturing efficiencies derived from the increase in unit volume production 
the benefit from manufacturing efficiencies was offset in part from an increase in display products as a percentage of total product revenues 
research and development 
funded research and development expenses were million for compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in funded research and development expenses in was primarily due to an increase in programs funded by agencies of the us government 
internal research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in internal research and development expenses was primarily a result of reduced research costs incurred for developing our display products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million in  a decrease of  in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include non cash charges for compensation expense of  for compared to  in relating to the issuance of certain stock options 
impairment charge 
in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling approximately million associated with the write down of equipment and intangible assets resulting from modification of certain processes in the production of our cyberdisplay products to improve manufacturing flexibility 
other 
other expenses were  for compared to  in  an increase of  other income  net 
other income  net was million in compared to million in  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income of  to million in from million in  resulting from higher cash balances in this increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense of  due to additional debt funding 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities  research and development contract revenues  and sales of our gallium arsenide and display products 
we believe our available cash resources will support our operations and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of december   we had cash and equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital of million compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase in cash and equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to proceeds from an october public common stock offering that resulted in net proceeds to the company of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  partially offset by cash used in operations of  capital expenditures of million  and principal payments on long term obligations of million 
the increase in capital expenditures is primarily for our expansion programs to increase manufacturing capacity for our gallium arsenide and display products 
we periodically enter into long term debt arrangements to finance equipment purchases and other activities 
as of december   long term debt obligations totaled million  of which million is payable in the next twelve months 
our cyberdisplay products are targeted at large sales volume consumer electronic and wireless communication applications 
we believe that in order to obtain customers in these markets  it has been necessary to make significant investments in equipment and infrastructure 
we believe that it will be necessary to continue to make significant investments in equipment and development in order to produce current and future cyberdisplay products 
as a result of the current cost structure of our cyberdisplay product line  our ability to achieve profitability in that product line depends upon achieving significant sales volumes and higher gross profit margins 
we have not yet produced our cyberdisplay products at volumes necessary to achieve profitability 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain sufficient sales volumes  or if sufficient sales volumes are achieved  we may not be able to produce our cyberdisplay products at a gross margin which will allow the product line to generate a profit 
we lease equipment and our facilities located in taunton and westborough  massachusetts  and los gatos  california  under non cancelable operating leases 
the taunton lease expires in october the westborough lease expires in october  with renewable options for up to three additional years at our election 
the los gatos lease covers a five year period terminating in we record costs incurred under operating leases as rent expense and this expense aggregated approximately million for we expect to expend approximately million on capital expenditures over the next twelve months  primarily for the acquisition of equipment relating to the production of our hbt transistor wafers and the manufacturing  packaging and testing of cyberdisplay products  including the establishment of a second manufacturing product facility for our hbt transistor wafers 
as of december   we had tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  which may be used to offset future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years commencing after june  sfas no 
requires fair value accounting for all stand alone derivatives and many derivatives embedded in other financial instruments and contracts 
the impact of sfas no 
on us has not yet been determined 
seasonality the company s business is not seasonal in nature 
inflation the company does not believe that its operations have been materially affected by inflationary forces 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in high quality government and corporate financial instruments which generally bear minimal risk 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
we sell our products to customers worldwide 
we maintain a reserve for potential credit losses and such losses have been minimal 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange primarily through our translation of our foreign subsidiary s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows and the sale of our cyberdisplay products to customers in asia 
risk factors this form k report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industries in which kopin operates  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
in addition  other written or oral statements which constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on behalf of the company 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in outcomes and results  include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
we have experienced a history of losses and have a significant accumulated deficit 
we did not achieve profitability on an annual basis until since inception  we have incurred significant net operating losses 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively  and as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we cannot assure you that we will maintain profitability in the future 
our revenue and cash flow could be negatively affected by the loss of any of the few customers who account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
a few customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales of our hbt transistor wafers to conexant systems accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from multiple contracts with various us governmental agencies accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we anticipate that sales of our hbt transistor wafers to conexant will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the near future 
a reduction in research and development contracts from the us government or a reduction or delay in orders from conexant or any of our other significant customers would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we are unable to significantly increase our cyberdisplay production capacity and reduce our cyberdisplay production costs  our business will suffer 
we have limited experience manufacturing display products 
we expect to significantly increase our cyberdisplay production capacity in in an attempt to meet anticipated increased demand 
we are also embarking on an initiative to automate portions of our display manufacturing process to increase throughput and lower unit production costs 
if we are unable to successfully increase our cyberdisplay production capacity and reduce manufacturing costs  we may lose customer orders and our display business will remain unprofitable 
our cyberdisplay products may not be accepted by the market 
we have had limited sales of our cyberdisplay products to date 
our success will in large part depend on the widespread adoption of the viewing format of our cyberdisplay 
our success also depends upon the widespread consumer acceptance of our customers products 
potential customers may be reluctant to adopt our cyberdisplay products because of concerns surrounding perceived risks relating to o the introduction of our display technology generally  o consumer acceptance of our cyberdisplay products  and o the relative complexity  reliability  usefulness and cost effectiveness of our display products compared to other display products available in the market or that may be developed by our competitors 
in addition  our customers may be reluctant to rely upon a relatively small company such as kopin for a critical component 
we cannot assure you that prospective customers will adopt our cyberdisplay products or that consumers will accept our cyberdisplay products 
if we fail to achieve market acceptance of our cyberdisplay products  our business may not be successful and the value of your investment in kopin may decline 
our success depends on the continued growth and evolution of the wireless communications market 
sales of products for wireless communications applications constitute substantially all of our current  and a significant portion of our projected  product revenues and cash flows 
the implementation of higher bandwidth infrastructure will be needed to drive the development of the next generation of wireless communications services 
these developments include data oriented services  such as internet browsing capabilities and the ability to view e mail and other information that should increase the demand for our products 
our success will depend in large part on the widespread adoption of this infrastructure and the cost effectiveness of these services to the consumer 
we may be unable to grow or sustain our business if there is a slowdown in the wireless communications market 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers  which makes forecasting our revenues and operating results difficult 
we generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our products 
our business is characterized by short term purchase orders and shipment schedules and we generally permit orders to be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty 
as a result  forecasting our revenues is difficult 
in addition  due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our operating results are difficult to forecast because we are continuing to invest in capital equipment and increasing our operating expenses for personnel and new product development 
if we fail to accurately forecast our revenues and operating results  our business may not be successful and the value of your investment in kopin may decline 
potential fluctuations in operating results make financial forecasting difficult and could affect the price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
you should not rely on our revenues and our operating results for any one quarter or year as an indication of our future revenues or operating results 
our revenues and our results of operations may fluctuate for several reasons including o the timing and successful introduction of additional manufacturing capacity  o the timing of the initial selection of our hbt transistor wafers and cyberdisplay products as a component in our customers new products  o market acceptance of our and our customers products  o competitive pressures on selling prices of our cyberdisplay products  o the timing and cancellation of customer orders  o our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  o our ability to successfully reduce costs  and o the cancellation of us government contracts 
if our quarterly revenues or results of operations fall below expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
disruptions of our hbt transistor wafer production would adversely affect our operating results 
if we were to experience any significant disruption in the operation of our facilities  we would be unable to supply hbt transistor wafers to our customers 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and customer specifications are extremely precise 
we periodically modify our processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and to meet particular customer requirements 
we intend to broaden our volume production capabilities to produce hbt transistor wafers up to six inches in diameter  but we have limited experience in producing finished six inch hbt transistor wafers in commercial quantities 
process changes or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields 
additionally  as we introduce new equipment into our manufacturing processes  our hbt transistor wafer products could be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
we may experience manufacturing problems that would result in delays in product introduction and delivery or yield fluctuations 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the shortage of raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we would be unable to manufacture and distribute our cyberdisplay products if the third parties we rely on for manufacturing and packaging fail to provide those services 
we depend on united microelectronics corporation  or umc  and its affiliate  unipac optoelectronics  for the fabrication of integrated circuits and a portion of the packaging of our cyberdisplay products 
we have no long term contracts with these companies  both of which are located in taiwan 
if these companies were to terminate their arrangements with us or become unable to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis  we would be unable to manufacture and ship our cyberdisplay products until replacement foundry or packaging services could be obtained 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing and packaging relationships on acceptable terms 
our reliance on umc and unipac involves certain risks  including o the lack of control over production capacity and delivery schedules  o limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and o the risks associated with international commerce  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs and trade policies and political and economic instability 
umc and unipac  as well as several other third parties with which we do business  are located in taiwan 
due to the earthquake that occurred in taiwan in  many taiwanese companies including umc and unipac experienced related business interruptions 
both umc and unipac have resumed normal operations 
our business could suffer significantly if umc or unipac s operations were disrupted again for an extended period of time 
we also depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets for use with our cyberdisplay products 
motorola currently produces integrated circuit chip sets for use with our cyberdisplay products in camcorders 
if motorola or any other third party were unable to supply these integrated circuit chip sets  we would be unable to sell our cyberdisplay products until a replacement supplier could be found 
any interruption in our ability to manufacture and distribute our cyberdisplay products could cause our display business to be unsuccessful and the value of your investment in kopin may decline 
we may not be able to operate multiple manufacturing facilities successfully 
a critical part of our business strategy is the expansion of our production capacity 
we plan to establish a second facility to manufacture our hbt transistor wafers and we are also considering the establishment of additional internal or third party manufacturing capability to produce our cyberdisplay products 
to date  we have operated only one facility for each of our product lines  and we have no experience operating multiple facilities to manufacture a single product line 
our ability to successfully operate additional manufacturing sites will depend on a number of factors including o the identification and availability of appropriate and affordable sites  o the management of facility construction and development timing and costs  o the establishment of adequate management and information systems and financial controls  and o the adaptation of our complex manufacturing process in our additional sites 
additionally  we cannot be sure that any new manufacturing facilities will have operating results similar to those of our current facilities 
any failure to effectively implement our expansion strategy would adversely impact our ability to grow our business 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our products 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
we compete with several companies primarily engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing and selling integrated circuits or alternative display technologies  as well as the supply of other discrete products 
our competitors could develop new process technologies that may be superior to ours  including technologies that target markets in which our products are sold 
many of our existing and potential competitors have strong market positions  considerable internal manufacturing capacity  established intellectual property rights and substantial technological capabilities 
furthermore  they also have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and personnel resources than we do  and we may not be able to compete successfully with them 
in addition  many of our existing and potential customers manufacture or assemble wireless communications devices and have substantial in house technological capabilities 
if one of our large customers establishes internal design and manufacturing capabilities  it could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect competition to increase 
this could mean lower prices or reduced demand for our products 
any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if we fail to keep pace with changing technologies  we may lose customers 
the advanced semiconductor materials and display industries are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and evolving technologies and industry standards 
to achieve our goals  we need to enhance our existing products and develop and market new products that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and requirements and customer preferences 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes  our business could suffer 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and manufacturing processes 
to that end  we have obtained certain domestic and foreign patents and we intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
we also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws 
our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while in our employ 
if these measures fail to adequately protect our intellectual and proprietary rights  our business will not be successful and the value of your investment in kopin may decline 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of  or fail to attract  key personnel 
in order to continue to provide quality products in our rapidly changing business  we believe it is important to retain personnel with experience and expertise relevant to our business 
our success depends in large part upon a number of key management and technical employees 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees  including john cc fan  our president and chief executive officer  could seriously impede our success 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies on dr 
fan or any other employees 
in addition  due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers  our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions 
we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel 
we may be unable to continue to grow at our historical growth rates or to manage our growth effectively 
in and  we have experienced significant growth in our hbt transistor wafer business and we anticipate growth in our cyberdisplay business 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated growth is expected to place  significant strain on our limited administrative  operational and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures  controls and existing and planned space will be adequate to support our future operations 
as a result of these concerns  we cannot be sure that we will continue to grow  or  if we do grow  that we will be able to maintain our historical growth rate 
we may pursue acquisitions and investments that could adversely affect our business 
in the past we have made  and in the future we may make  acquisitions of and investments in businesses  products and technologies that could complement or expand our business 
if we identify an acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition or integrate the acquired businesses  products or technologies into our existing business and products 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization expenses and write downs of acquired assets 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with stringent environmental regulations or if we did not comply with these regulations in the past 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our activities conform to environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
we cannot assure you that we have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations  which could result in required remediation or other liabilities 
you should not expect to receive dividends from us 
we have not paid dividends in the past  nor do we expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that earnings  if any  will be retained for the development of our businesses 
our stock price may be volatile in the future 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the wireless communications  semiconductor and display markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
