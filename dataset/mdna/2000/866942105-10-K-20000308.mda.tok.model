item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sun hydraulics corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance screw in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds  which control force  speed and motion as integral components in fluid power systems 
the company sells its products globally  primarily though independent distributors 
approximately of product sales are used by the mobile market  characterized by applications where the equipment is not fixed in place  the operating environment is often unpredictable  and duty cycles are generally moderate to low 
the remaining of sales are used by industrial markets  which are characterized by equipment that is fixed in place  typically in a controlled environment  with higher pressures and duty cycles 
the company sells to both markets with a single product line 
in  the company generated approximately of its net sales outside of the united states  and its single largest end user customer represented less than of net sales 
demand for the company s products is dependent on demand for the capital goods into which the products are incorporated 
the capital goods industries in general  and the fluid power industry specifically  are subject to economic cycles 
in the last half of  and throughout  the company experienced little or negative growth due to a slowdown in many of the capital goods industries that use the company s products 
according to the national fluid power association the fluid power industry s trade association in the united states  united states orders for mobile hydraulic products were down in compared to  and orders of industrial hydraulic products were down for the same time period 
shipments of mobile hydraulic products were down in  compared to  and shipments of industrial hydraulic products were down for the same time period 
the company s orders decreased in  compared to  which management believes is largely attributable to the aforementioned slowdown in the capital goods industries 
for the first three quarters of  orders decreased  compared to the first three quarters of  with the decrease evident in all major markets with the exception of asia 
during the fourth quarter of  orders increased compared to the fourth quarter of  with increases evident in all major markets 
management believes that the order increase is indicative of an upturn in the business cycle of the capital goods industries 
the company s net sales decreased in  compared to north american distributor inventories of sun products decreased approximately from december to december  consistent with the slowdown in the capital goods industries 
net sales and operating profits were adversely affected in the united states operation  primarily in the second quarter  and the united kingdom operation in the fourth quarter  due to the implementation of new  fully integrated manufacturing software systems 
decreases seen in all major markets except germany were partially offset by the incremental net sales gain related to acquisition of the korean subsidiary in the fourth quarter of on the positive side  the supplier initiative begun during the fourth quarter of contributed favorably to operating profits  especially in the second half of for the past two years  the company has focused its efforts on increasing its productive capacity in anticipation of a business cycle upturn 
capacity expansion plans are substantially complete and management believes the company has the necessary capacity to meet the expected increase in demand for its products 
geographic highlights in  the company continued to expand its geographic presence and to concentrate on capacity expansion programs united states in late  the high volume production cell was relocated from the company s sarasota facility to its manatee facility and a new heat treat operation was installed at that site 
the move was completed with minimal disruption to production 
the space vacated by the move of the cell is being reconfigured with a focus on improving the manufacturing  assembly and testing processes used for products that are required in lower volumes and the processes used in new product development 
with these arrangements  the company believes it has the productive capacity to respond to market demands for the foreseeable future 
england the plans to expand the facility in england are still under review but may be partially implemented in germany the german facility began production of limited quantities of manifolds for local customers and continued design work on new cartridge valves 
it is anticipated that this facility will begin assembling and testing cartridge valves for the european market in  including the company s new electrically actuated solenoid cartridge valves 
korea the business climate in korea has improved and the company s korean subsidiary has seen increased sales 
to date  no cash flow problems have been evident relating to the financial restructuring at daewoo group  the largest korean customer 
the company is currently reviewing the assembly of some of its cartridge valves at its korean facility for sale in the korean market 
china the joint venture in china has begun production of manifold products and had a minimal amount of sales in the company expects sales from the joint venture to increase in  but not to the extent that they will have a material effect on profit 
orders for the company s series products continued to increase in orders for the company s electrically actuated solenoid products  introduced in europe in april and to north american distributors in september  are not yet significant 
management believes the demand for these products will build slowly as distributors and customers evaluate product performance and begin to build stock 
it is expected that the availability of solenoid cartridges will have a long term positive effect on demand for manifolds and the company s non solenoid cartridge valves 
the company has always encouraged the hydraulics industry to recognize the benefits associated with the cavity structure and design ideas utilized in its products 
management believes the adoption by other companies of the cavity structure utilized by the company will increase its total market opportunities 
as part of its efforts to encourage the use of its cavity structure and cartridge design in the marketplace  the company is in the process of finalizing a non exclusive manufacturing license agreement with mannesmann rexroth  ag the agreement allows the licensee to manufacture specified products under its own label 
additionally  mannesmann rexroth will brand label some products manufactured by the company and utilize other of the company s products in systems that rexroth produces 
the company believes the endorsement evidenced by mannesmann rexroth s adoption of its cavity structure and cartridge valve design will further expand the market opportunities for its products 
the company anticipates it will evaluate similar agreements with other manufacturers of fluid power components when it would be of strategic benefit 
utilization of the company s unique design by other cartridge valve manufacturers offers an opportunity for the company s cavity to be recognized as an industry standard

year readiness disclosure the following is a summary of actions taken by the company during the years preceding january  in anticipation of the year transition and the potential problems that computer systems and embedded technology could experience handling dates beyond the year in order to address potential computer problems arising in connection with the year  the company devised the following four phased approach assessment  testing  renovation and validation 
with regard to its internal operations  the assessment phase consisted of the inventory of all systems  including hardware  software and embedded systems such as the company s cnc equipment in all of company s locations  the identification of all critical applications  and the collection of all internal source codes 
the testing phase included the testing of the company s critical applications for year readiness 
the company defined year ready to mean that neither the performance nor functionality of any of its critical systems  including both information technology and non information technology systems  would be materially affected by dates prior to  during and after the year the renovation phase involved the replacement of all non compliant systems with year compliant systems 
the validation phase involved the re testing of all upgraded systems 
as of january   all material aspects of the company s internal year plan had been completed 
as a result of its assessment and testing phases  the company identified and modified certain software subsystems and routines that required modification to be fully year compliant 
in addition  the company replaced the computer operating systems in its united states sarasota facility and in its united kingdom facility with enterprise wide manufacturing systems that are year ready 
the company also has assessed the year readiness of its key suppliers by inquiring about their year readiness and  whenever possible  obtaining year readiness warranties or statements as to their readiness 
no major vendor issues were reported over the year transition 
the company estimates that  as of january   the cost of remediating replacing its internal systems was approximately million 
the company funded this effort through operating cash flows 
this estimate includes remediation of key information technology and non information technology systems  but does not include the potential costs related to any customer or other claims and the costs of any disruptions caused by suppliers not being year ready 
this estimate is based on a current assessment of the year project and is subject to change 
because the company experienced no major year related issues internally or externally over the year transition  it does not currently believe that it will incur material costs or experience material disruptions in its business associated with the year however  there can be no assurance that year issues will not be uncovered in the future or that the costs of any such year issues will not have a material impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in future periods 
seasonality the company s generally has experienced reduced activity during the fourth quarter of the year  largely as a result of fewer working days due to holiday shutdowns 
as a result  the company s fourth quarter net sales  income from operations and net income typically are the lowest of any quarter during the year 
however  during fiscal  due to the company s poor second quarter results  this was not the case 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
euro on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their national currencies and the euro  which will ultimately result in the replacement of the currencies of these participating countries with the euro the euro conversion 
the company has assessed the potential impact of the euro conversion and has initiated an internal analysis to plan for the conversion and implement remediation measures 
the company s german operation converted its functional currency to the euro in january costs associated with the euro conversion are being expensed by the company during the period in which they are incurred and are not currently anticipated to be material 
the company presently believes that  with remediation measures  any material risks associated with the euro conversion can be mitigated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowed funds  which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
at january   the company had approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding and  as such  the market risk is immaterial based upon a increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by selecting unsecured debt financing at its lenders prime rate less  or the libor rate plus  whichever is the more advantageous
