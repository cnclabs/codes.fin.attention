item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating segments in accordance with the requirements of fasb sfas no 
 the registrant is segregated into the following segments roofing products  electronics manufacturing services and industrial products 
the roofing products group consists of the various operating subsidiaries of elk corporation of dallas collectively elk 
these companies manufacture and sell premium laminated fiberglass asphalt residential and accessory roofing products  together with coated and uncoated nonwoven mats used in manufacturing asphalt roofing products and various industrial applications 
elk accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal the electronics manufacturing services segment consists of the various operating subsidiaries of cybershield  inc collectively cybershield 
these companies are engaged in the shielding of plastic components  conductive dispense gaskets  vacuum metalization and other value added services for the telecommunications  computer and electronic equipment industries 
due to the increasing materiality of the electronic manufacturing services business to the registrant  its operations have been segregated into a separate segment as of june  these operations were previously included in the industrial products group 
cybershield accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal the industrial products group is comprised of remanufactured reciprocating engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries  and technology licensing and consulting services for the natural gas processing industry 
the industrial products group companies accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   net income before last year s cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to  from  in fiscal sales increased to  in the current fiscal year compared to  in the prior year 
the registrant s largest business segment  roofing products  registered a strong year with overall higher sales and operating income 
this improved financial performance  together with increasing demand for products used in digital wireless cellular phones offered by the electronics manufacturing services segment  led to the overall increases in consolidated sales and income 
the growth in these two business segments was partially offset by disappointing operating results in the industrial products segment 
overall  operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal were nearly equal to that in the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were only of sales in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended june   the registrant recorded a  gain from involuntary conversion as a result of payments received on a property insurance claim in excess of the net book value of destroyed assets 
interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in the prior fiscal year as the registrant capitalized  of interest in the current year period in connection with the construction of its new myerstown  pennsylvania shingle plant and other major projects 
in fiscal   in interest costs were capitalized 
results of business segments sales for the roofing products group increased to  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
demand for and shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles were at record levels in the first nine months of fiscal even with shipments of these products being held down by lower laminated shingle inventories 
the inventory shortage was partially due to manufacturing inefficiencies related to elk s use of alternative sources of nonwoven fiberglass mat in its manufacturing process as a result of an explosion in fiscal at elk s nonwoven fiberglass mat plant in ennis  texas 
in addition  shipments resulting from large orders from customers in march made in anticipation of announced price increases substantially decreased shipments of laminated shingle shipments in the early part of the fourth quarter of fiscal despite the inventory shortage early in the year and the decrease in shipments for a portion of the fourth quarter  in fiscal elk still achieved a small increase in shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles compared to fiscal average selling prices were slightly higher in fiscal than in fiscal elk also registered increased sales for nonwoven mats used in manufacturing asphalt roofing products and various industrial applications 
operating income for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
together with increased sales  elk achieved higher production  which lowered per unit manufacturing costs 
in the second half of fiscal  operating income was adversely affected by rapidly escalating asphalt and glass fiber costs 
elk implemented price increases on march  and may  as a result of these higher raw material costs 
however  higher selling prices subsequent to these price increases did not fully offset the substantial increases in raw material costs 
further  competitive pressures have limited elk s ability to implement further price increases 
operating income for fiscal also included  of income relating to settlement of the registrant s business interruption claim caused by the fiscal plant explosion 
sales for the electronics manufacturing services group increased to  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  in fiscal operating income for the electronics manufacturing services group increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increases in sales and operating income reflect increased demand for cybershield s advanced shielding products and related services for the digital wireless cellular phone industry 
the current year results include a full year of operations for cybershield s canton  georgia operation  which was acquired in january cybershield s sales and operating income in the latter part of fiscal were held down by actions of a significant customer to establish a second production source for a portion of its cellular handset shielding requirements  and temporary delays in the production launch by another key customer of a new cellular handset which contains significant cybershield value added content 
these actions had a further negative effect on cybershield s operating margins as staffing had been increased to accommodate the production volumes which were changed or temporarily delayed 
cybershield plans to expand its digital wireless cellular phone business to serve the european  asian and latin american markets over the next few years through acquisition or other business arrangements to better serve its customers growing markets for digital wireless cellular phones and other digital wireless electronic products 
cybershield is currently reviewing options to establish operations in europe in fiscal before pursuing other global growth opportunities 
sales for the industrial products group decreased in fiscal to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the operating loss for the industrial products group for fiscal was  compared to an operating profit of  last year 
in fiscal  chromium corporation s sales decreased compared to the prior year as a result of the relocation of manufacturing facilities for remanufactured diesel engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries and the impact of the consolidation of its manufacturing operations 
chromium was unable to fulfill demand for its remanufactured diesel engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries during the period when its facilities were being consolidated 
primarily as a result of about  nonrecurring expenses relating to the consolidation of its manufacturing operations  chromium recorded a significant operating loss in fiscal compared to a small operating profit achieved in the same period last year 
revenues and operating results for ortloff s patent licensing and engineering consulting services were also lower in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to  from  in fiscal sales increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increases in sales and income before the accounting change were primarily the result of increased production  a record level of shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles  and accelerating demand for cybershield s products used in digital wireless cellular phones 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the registrant adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants  which resulted in a  charge  net of tax  for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
this one time cumulative charge reduced net income for fiscal to  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
operating margin as a percentage of sales improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal increased from fiscal  primarily as a result of increased business activity 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs in fiscal declined to of sales from in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the registrant capitalized  in interest costs in connection with the construction of major projects  compared to  capitalized in fiscal results of business segments sales for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of the registrant s three roofing plants recorded increased sales as a result of strong demand in most regions of the united states 
elk s shipments were aided by relatively mild weather during the winter months which permitted increased roofing activity in elk s seasonally slower period together with sharply higher demand throughout the fiscal year in the residential roofing replacement market 
average selling prices were slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal and customer discounts were lower 
operating income for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of the three roofing plants achieved significantly higher operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of increased manufacturing output and a record level of shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles 
elk s nonwoven fiberglass roofing mat plant also contributed to improved results for the roofing products group 
however  a dryer on one production line was damaged by an explosion on september  and the damaged line was shut down or ran at curtailed line speeds for much of fiscal due to the registrant s property damage and business interruption insurance policies  this explosion did not have a material effect on the registrant s results of operations  financial position or liquidity in fiscal as of june  the plant was again running at line speeds equivalent to line speeds at the time of the explosion 
sales for the electronics manufacturing services group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal however  operating income decreased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal during fiscal  the registrant continued to benefit from strong demand for cybershield s conductive coatings and formed in place dispense gaskets used in digital wireless cellular phones and other electronic products 
on january   a subsidiary of the registrant acquired ydk america  inc renamed cybershield of georgia  inc in june 
operations of this acquired company were included in fiscal operations subsequent to its acquisition 
the small decrease in operating income in fiscal was primarily the result of a loss incurred at this new facility in the latter part of fiscal sales for the industrial products group decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income for this group decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal chromium experienced lower demand for remanufactured large diesel engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries  due primarily to further consolidation of the railroad industry and a reduction in maintenance requirements by some of its customers 
severance costs of  relating to terminating employees at its lufkin  texas facility were recorded in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  chromium also recorded a  pretax charge to settle some long standing third party tort litigation 
ortloff s patent licensing and engineering consulting services to the petroleum industry were significantly lower in fiscal as a result of depressed oil prices during much of the fiscal year  causing many of its customers to temporarily reduce capital spending plans 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the registrant generated cash flows of  from operating activities 
working capital requirements decreased by about  primarily due to higher accounts payable and lower other current assets  partially offset by higher inventories 
the higher level of accounts payable was primarily attributable to increased liabilities associated with the construction of a new roofing plant and changes in debt management procedures 
lower other current assets primarily reflect collections from and final settlement in february with an insurance company related to the explosion at its fiberglass roofing mat plant that occurred in ennis  texas in fiscal inventories were significantly higher at june  than at june  finished goods inventory levels at elk reflect higher production at the registrant s roofing plants in fiscal compared to fiscal  combined with a reduction in shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  finished goods inventory levels were extremely low at the end of the prior fiscal year due to very high levels of shipments in late fiscal  combined with manufacturing inefficiencies related to the use of alternative sources of nonwoven fiberglass mat in elk s manufacturing process necessitated by the nonwoven mat plant accident in fiscal trade receivables were lower at june  than at the end of the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower sales volumes in the latter part of fiscal  partially offset by higher deferred receivables 
at june   deferred term receivables from promotional programs to certain customers were  compared to  at the end of the prior fiscal year 
deferred receivables outstanding at june  are primarily due during the first three months of fiscal the current ratio was to at june  compared to at june  historically  working capital requirements fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and related borrowings are higher in the spring and summer months  and lower in the fall and winter months 
the registrant used  for net investing activities in fiscal most expenditures were for additions to property  plant and equipment 
about  of capital expenditures in fiscal were for the purchase of land and construction costs relating to the new myerstown  pennsylvania premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingle plant 
this new facility is expected to be completed in fall with manufacturing operations scheduled to begin in the december quarter 
the myerstown plant is expected to increase the registrant s overall laminated shingle capacity by about 
the registrant plans to continue its significant expansion plan over the next several years 
expansion plans include completion of its fourth roofing plant currently under construction  evaluation of the need for a fifth roofing plant in two to three years  expanding capacity and improving productivity at existing plants  installing production lines for new products  and increasing capacity for cybershield s digital wireless cellular phone business  including international expansion 
cash flows from financing activities were  during fiscal  primarily resulting from a  increase in long term debt 
long term debt represented of the  of invested capital long term debt plus shareholders equity at june  in september  the registrant s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  of common stock from time to time on the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
as of june    shares with a cumulative cost of  had been repurchased under this authorization 
effective january   the registrant increased its revolving credit facility from  to  and extended the facility to december  to support its capital expansion program 
management is currently considering further increasing its revolving credit facility and believes it can secure additional capital to support its growth and expansion plans 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  projected cash flows from operations  combined with an increased unsecured revolving credit facility should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund its expansion plans  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements 
the registrant s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
although the registrant does not believe it will be required to expend amounts which will have a material adverse effect on the registrant s consolidated financial position or results of operations by reason of environmental laws and regulations  such laws and regulations are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
further  certain of the registrant s industrial products and electronics manufacturing services operations utilize hazardous materials in their production processes 
as a result  the registrant incurs costs for remediation activities off site and at its facilities from time to time 
the registrant establishes and maintains reserves for such remediation activities  when appropriate 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to the registrant s financial position or results of operations 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at june   the registrant had entered into no significant derivative instruments or hedging activities  although the registrant regularly reviews the potential benefits of interest rate swaps and other potential hedging arrangements and may enter into derivative or hedging instruments from time to time in the future 
the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  in december the registrant is required to adopt this new accounting guidance no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal the registrant is evaluating the conceptual guidance provided by sab no 
 but does not believe the adoption of guidance provided by sab no 
will have a material impact on future operating results 
year issue as of june   the registrant has experienced no significant problems relating to its year readiness 
the registrant continues to monitor activities within the company and with its suppliers and other third parties 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the registrant s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis and the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements about its prospects for the future 
the statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements usually are accompanied by words such as outlook  believe  estimate  plan  project  expect  anticipate  predict  could  should  may  or similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
these statements are based on judgments the registrant believes are reasonable  however  the registrant s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following the registrant s roofing products business is substantially non cyclical  but can be affected by weather  the availability of financing and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the registrant s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
further  changes in building codes and other standards from time to time can cause changes in demand  or increases in costs that may not be passed through to customers 
in the asphalt roofing products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher trucking and rail costs 
historically  the registrant has been able to pass some of the higher raw material and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the registrant be unable to recover higher raw material and or transportation costs from price increases of its products  operating results could be adversely affected and or lower than projected 
the registrant plans to continue its significant expansion plan over the next several years  including the construction of new facilities 
progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict for new plant facilities 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  if substantial cost overruns occur in building new plants  or if demand for products produced at new plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the registrant s electronics manufacturing services and industrial products subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the registrant could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the registrant s litigation  including elk s defense of purported class action lawsuits  is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
although the registrant currently anticipates that most of its needs for new capital in the near future will be met with internally generated funds or borrowings under its available credit facilities  significant increases in interest rates could substantially affect its borrowing costs under its existing loan facility  or its cost of alternative sources of capital 
each of the registrant s businesses  especially cybershield s shielding business  is subject to the risks of technological changes that could affect the demand for or the relative cost of the registrant s products and services  or the method and profitability of the method of distribution or delivery of such products and services 
in addition  the registrant s businesses each could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income if it lost one or more of its largest customers  or if its customers plans and or markets should change significantly 
although the registrant insures itself against physical loss to its manufacturing facilities  including business interruption losses  natural or other disasters and accidents  including but not limited to fire  earthquake  damaging winds and explosions  operating results could be adversely affected if any of its manufacturing facilities became inoperable for an extended period of time due to such events 
each of the registrant s businesses is actively involved in the development of new products  processes and services which are expected to contribute to the registrant s ongoing long term growth and earnings 
if such development activities are not successful  or the registrant cannot provide the requisite financial and other resources to successfully commercialize such developments  the growth of future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the registrant s exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency risk is not material 
the registrant s outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
changes in market rates effect interest paid by the registrant 
the registrant has not entered into any significant derivative instruments or hedging activities  although the registrant regularly reviews the potential benefits of interest rate swap arrangements and other hedging activities and may enter into derivative instruments from time to time in the future
