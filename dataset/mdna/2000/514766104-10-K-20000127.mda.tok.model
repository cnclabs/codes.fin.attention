     item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been primarily engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast tm splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intellipac breathable membranes for the fresh cut produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems for the industrial specialties market in june  and intellicoat coated inbred corn seeds in the fall of on december   the company acquired apio  inc and certain related entities apio 
apio is a leading marketer and packer of produce and specialty packaged fresh cut vegetables 
see business description of core business food products technology business apio  inc during fiscal years through  the company managed its operations in three business segments food products technology  agricultural seed technology and industrial high performance materials 
with the acquisition of apio  the company will be focusing on two vertically integrated core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intellipac breathable membrane technology with apio s fresh cut produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with fielder s choice s direct marketing  telephonic sales and e commerce distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
dock resins  the company s polymer manufacturer supports the needs of these core businesses and manufactures products for the specialty polymer industry and intelimer polymer systems customers 
the company has been unprofitable during each fiscal year since its inception 
from inception through october   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
results of operations the company s results of operations reflect only the continuing operations of the company and do not include the results of the discontinued quickcast operation 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year primarily due to increased product sales from fielder s choice and intellipac breathable membrane products which increased from million and million  respectively  in fiscal year to million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the increase in fielder s choice revenues was primarily due to increased per unit sales prices  and the increase in intellipac breathable membrane revenues was primarily due to the introduction of various new products and increased volumes for existing products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in dock resins product sales from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year this decrease is a result of the overall weakness in the chemical industry during fiscal year revenues from research and development funding were  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in research and development revenues was primarily due to the completion of research and development arrangements with hitachi chemical and nitta corporation in fiscal year revenues from license fees during fiscal year were  compared to  during fiscal year the increase in revenues from license fees was due to a payment received from alcon in fiscal year upon meeting a certain milestone related to the licensing agreement for the port ophthalmic devices 
with the acquisition of apio  the company expects future revenues to be significantly higher 
cost of product sales consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of product sales was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of higher average selling prices of fielder s choice products  partially offset by start up costs associated with establishing a new manufacturing facility in menlo park for intellipac breathable membrane products 
the company anticipates future cost of product sales  in absolute dollars  to be significantly higher due to the acquisition of apio 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to increase due to apio s current mix of products having lower percentage margins than landec s other businesses 
however  gross margins in absolute dollars are expected to significantly increase due to apio s high sales volume 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the company s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses involved in product development process scale up  patent activities related to the company s side chain crystallizable polymer technology  and research and development expenses related to dock resins products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased development costs for the company s intellicoat seed coating products  partially offset by a reduction in costs in the industrial high performance materials area 
in future periods  the company expects that spending for research and development will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although it will decrease significantly as a percentage of total revenues due to the acquisition of apio 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with the company s product sales  business development expenses  and staff and administrative expenses 
specifically  sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year  from million for fiscal year beginning fiscal year  total selling  general and administrative spending is expected to increase significantly  due to the acquisition of apio  although as a percentage of total revenues it is expected to decrease 
net interest income was  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year the decrease during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due principally to less cash being available for investing 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  total revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to million of product sales from fielder s choice  which was acquired in september  and an increase of million of product sales from dock resins  which was acquired in april also contributing to the increase were intellipac breathable membrane product sales which increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  due primarily to an increase in unit sales and the introduction of several new products 
revenues from research and development funding were million for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year the increase in research and development revenues was primarily due to the agreement with alcon for the funding of the port program 
revenues from license fees during fiscal year were  compared to none during fiscal year the increase in license fees revenue was due to a payment in the first quarter of fiscal year under the port license agreement with alcon 
cost of product sales consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of product sales was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily the result of higher margins resulting from product sales of fielder s choice and dock resins products 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increased development costs for the company s intellipac and intellicoat seed coating products and a full year of development costs related to dock resins products 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of an entire year of expenses and amortization of goodwill for dock resins and fielder s choice  which were acquired during fiscal year specifically  sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal year  from million for fiscal year net interest income was  for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was due principally to less cash being available for investing 
liquidity and capital resources as of october  the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  a net decrease of million from million as of october  this decrease was primarily due to cash used in operations of million and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment partially offset by cash provided by financing activities of approximately  from primarily the sale of common stock and repayment of notes receivable from shareholders 
the cash used in operations was primarily comprised of planned purchases of fielder s choice corn seed inventory to support the fiscal year growing season and deferred expenses associated with the apio acquisition which were recorded to other current assets 
the majority of the company s million of property and equipment expenditures during fiscal year was incurred for building improvement and equipment upgrade expenditures at dock resins to expand capacity  and purchasing quality assurance equipment to support the development of intellipac and intellicoat products 
subsequent to fiscal year end  and as a result of raising million upon the sale of preferred stock and securing a new million term debt agreement to acquire apio  inc  the company s cash balance increased to over million 
in addition  apio entered into a new million line of credit agreement with bank of america 
the term debt and line of credit agreements loan agreements contain restrictive covenants which require apio to meet certain financial tests  including minimum levels of ebitda  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time 
the loan agreement  through restricted payment covenants  limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec  until the outstanding balance is reduced to an amount specified in the loan agreement 
in addition to the cash raised during the acquisition of apio inc  the company is currently in the process of establishing a credit facility to be used to fund the expansion of the manufacturing capabilities of intellicoat seed coating products 
the company believes that with these new facilities  along with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance operational and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company may  however  raise additional funds during the next twelve months through an equity financing 
if such financing does occur it will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of the company to maintain existing collaborative and licensing arrangements and establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  the seasonal needs to fund growing costs to ensure adequate and consistent supply of produce  and other factors 
if the company s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations  are not sufficient to satisfy its financing needs  the company would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to the company on favorable terms if at all 
additional factors that may affect future results the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  the company wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  the company s actual results and could cause the company s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the company assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit 
the company has incurred net losses in each fiscal year since its inception  including a net loss of million for fiscal year the company s accumulated deficit as of october  totaled million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
the company s substantial indebtedness could limit its financial and operating flexibility and subject it to other risks 
upon the closing of the apio acquisition  the company s total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  increased to approximately million and the total debt to equity ratio was approximately 
this level of indebtedness could have significant consequences because a substantial portion of the company s net cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes  the company s ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  and the company s level of indebtedness may limit its flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions generally 
the company s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on its future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
if the company were unable to service its debt  it would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be successful and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
in addition  apio is subject to various financial and operating covenants under its term debt and line of credit facilities the loan agreement  including minimum levels of ebitda  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
these requirements and ratios generally become more restrictive over time 
the loan agreement limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec until the outstanding balance is reduced to an amount specified in the loan agreement 
the company has pledged substantially all of apio s assets to secure its bank debt 
the company s failure to comply with the obligations under the loan agreement  including maintenance of financial ratios  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of the indebtedness due under the loan agreement 
any such violations of its obligations under the loan agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results 
in the past  the company s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future 
historically  the company s corn seed distributor  fielder s choice  has been the primary source of these fluctuations  as its revenues and profits are concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during the company s second quarter 
in addition  apio can be heavily affected by seasonal and weather factors which could impact quarterly results 
the company s earnings in its food products technology business will be sensitive to price fluctuations in the fresh vegetables and fruits markets 
excess supplies can cause intense price competition 
other factors affecting the company s food and or agricultural operations include the seasonality of its supplies  the ability to process produce during critical harvest periods  the timing and effects of ripening  the degree of perishability  the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems  the terms of various federal and state marketing orders  total worldwide industry volumes  the seasonality of consumer demand  foreign currency fluctuations  foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks 
as a result of these and other factors  the company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
uncertainty relating to integration of apio and other new business acquisitions 
the company s acquisition of apio involves the integration of apio s operations into the company 
the integration will require the dedication of management resources in order to achieve the anticipated operating efficiencies of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given that difficulties encountered in integrating the operations of apio into the company will be overcome or that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
the difficulties in combining apio and the company s operations are exacerbated by the necessity of coordinating geographically separate organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of the combined company s business 
difficulties encountered or additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and the integration of the operations of apio and the company could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company 
the successful integration of other new business acquisitions may require substantial effort from the company s management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
the successful combination of new businesses also requires coordination of research and development activities  manufacturing  and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the company s activities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel  or that the company will realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
early commercialization of certain products  dependence on new products and technologies  uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company is in the early stage of product commercialization of certain intellipac breathable membrane  intellicoat seed coating and intelimer polymer systems products and many of its potential products are in development 
the company believes that its future growth will depend in large part on its ability to develop and market new products in its target markets and in new markets 
in particular  the company expects that its ability to compete effectively with existing food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commercializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing the company s products 
in addition  commercial applications of the company s temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop  commercialize  achieve market acceptance of or reduce the costs of producing the company s new products  or that the company s competitors will not develop competing technologies that are less expensive or otherwise superior to those of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or that new products and technologies will gain market acceptance 
the failure to develop and successfully market new products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the success of the company in generating significant sales of its products will depend in part on the ability of the company and its partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of the company s new products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by the company s current and future products are a function of many variables including  but not limited to  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  conversion costs and marketing and sales efforts  as well as general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
there can be no assurance that markets for the company s new products will develop or that the company s new products and technology will be accepted and adopted 
the failure of the company s new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition and technological change 
the company operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of the company s collaborative arrangements may result in its corporate partners and licensees becoming competitors of the company 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than the company  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
there can be no assurance that these competitors will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
limited manufacturing experience  dependence on third parties 
the company s success is dependent in part upon its ability to manufacture its products in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve this 
although the company believes dock resins will provide landec with practical knowledge in the scale up of intelimer polymer products  production in commercial scale quantities may involve technical challenges for the company 
the company anticipates that a portion of the company s products will be manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility acquired in the purchase of dock resins 
the company s reliance on this facility involves a number of potential risks  including the unavailability of  or interruption in access to  certain process technologies and reduced control over delivery schedules  and low manufacturing yields and high manufacturing costs 
the company may also need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture certain of its products 
if the company becomes dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of its products  then the company s profit margins and its ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely basis may be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such parties will adequately perform and any failures by third parties may impair the company s ability to deliver products on a timely basis  impair the company s competitive position  or may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval 
in late fiscal  in an effort to reduce reliance on third party manufacturers  the company began the set up of a manufacturing operation at its facility in menlo park  california  for the production of intellipac breathable membrane products 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully operate a manufacturing operation at acceptable costs  with acceptable yields  and retain adequately trained personnel 
the occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on single source suppliers 
many of the raw materials used in manufacturing certain of the company s products are currently purchased from a single source  including certain monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for the company s breathable membrane products 
in addition  virtually all of the hybrid corn varieties sold by fielder s choice are purchased from a single source 
upon manufacturing scale up and as hybrid corn sales increase  the company may enter into alternative supply arrangements 
although to date the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring materials for the manufacture of its products nor has fielder s choice experienced difficulty in acquiring hybrid corn varieties  no assurance can be given that interruptions in supplies will not occur in the future  that the company will be able to obtain substitute vendors  or that the company will be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
any such interruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture and distribute its products and  consequently  could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will be approved  that the company will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable  that any patents issued to the company will provide the company with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by any third parties or that the patents of others will not prevent the commercialization of products incorporating the company s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s products or design around the company s patents 
the company has received  and may in the future receive  from third parties  including some of its competitors  notices claiming that it is infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
if the company were determined to be infringing any third party patent  the company could be required to pay damages  alter its products or processes  obtain licenses or cease certain activities 
if the company is required to obtain any licenses  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by the company  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to the company or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any such litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require the company to cease using such technology and  consequently  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business patents and proprietary rights in item environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use  storage  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in certain manufacturing processes  including those utilized by dock resins 
as a result of historic off site disposal practices  dock resins was recently involved in two actions seeking to compel the generators of hazardous waste to remediate hazardous waste sites 
dock resins has been informed by its counsel that it was a de minimis generator to these sites  and these actions have been settled without the payment of any material amount by the company 
in addition  the new jersey industrial site recovery act isra requires an investigation and remediation of any industrial establishment  like dock resins  which changes ownership 
this statute was activated by the company s acquisition of dock resins 
dock resins has completed its investigation of the site  delineated the limited areas of concern on the site  and completed the bulk of the active remediation required under the statute 
the costs associated with this effort are being borne by the former owner of dock resins  and counsel has advised dock resins and the company that funds of the former owner required by isra to be set aside for this effort are sufficient to pay for the successful completion of remedial activities at the site 
in most cases  the company believes its liability will be limited to sharing clean up or other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties 
any failure by the company to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject it to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that changes in environmental regulations will not impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
the company s agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those conducted by the company  and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  and further restrictions on the use of manufacturing chemicals could result in increased compliance costs 
adverse growing conditions 
the company s food products and agricultural seed technology businesses are subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices  crop yields  and decisions by growers regarding crops to be planted 
crop diseases and severe conditions  particularly weather conditions such as floods  droughts  frosts  windstorms and hurricanes may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in the company s business  reduce the sales volumes and increase the unit production costs 
because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year  volume declines due to production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken the company s financial condition 
if the supply of any of the company s products is adversely affected by the adverse conditions  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient supplies from alternative sources 
limited sales and marketing experience 
the company has only limited experience marketing and selling its intelimer polymer products 
while dock resins will provide consultation and in some cases direct marketing support for landec s intelimer polymer products  establishing sufficient marketing and sales capability will require significant resources 
the company intends to distribute certain of its products through its corporate partners and other distributors and to sell certain other products through a direct sales force 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct salespersons or distributors  or that the company s sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
to the extent that the company has entered into or will enter into distribution or other collaborative arrangements for the sale of its products  the company will be dependent on the efforts of third parties 
there can be no assurance that such sales and marketing efforts will be successful and any failure in such efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on collaborative partners and licensees 
for certain of its current and future products  the company s strategy for development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
the company is dependent on its corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture and or market certain of its products 
although the company believes that its partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that such partners will perform their obligations as expected or that the company will derive any additional revenue from such arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company s partners will pay any additional option or license fees to the company or that they will develop  market or pay any royalty fees related to products under the agreements 
moreover  certain of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and certain of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under certain other circumstances 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the amount of royalties  if any  on future sales of quickcast and port products as the company no longer has control over the sales of such products since the sale of quickcast and the license of the port product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company s partners will not pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to the company s technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such collaborative arrangements will be successful 
government regulation 
the company s products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
the manufacture of the company s products is subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although landec has no reason to believe that it will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of its products and polymer materials  such regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to such matters as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances will not adversely affect the company s business 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future  or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the apio acquisition  the company is subject to usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
see business governmental regulations in item international operations and sales 
in fiscal years and  approximately of the company s total revenues were derived from product sales to and collaborative agreements with international customers 
the company expects that with the acquisition of apio and its export business  international revenues will become an important component of its total revenues 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by the regulatory approval process  government controls  export license requirements  political instability  price controls  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs or difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s international business and its financial condition and results of operations 
while the company s foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  such as those recently experienced in many asian countries which comprise a part of the territories of certain of the company s collaborative partners and apio s export business  may reduce the demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold 
there can be no assurance that regulatory  geopolitical and other factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
customer concentration 
for the fiscal year  sales to the company s top five customers accounted for approximately of the company s product sales with the top customer accounting for of the company s product sales 
the company expects that for the foreseeable future a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of its net revenues 
the company may experience changes in the composition of its customer base  as apio  dock resins and fielder s choice have experienced in the past 
the company does not have long term purchase agreements with any of its customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of such major customers could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since certain products manufactured in the linden  new jersey facility or processed by apio at its guadalupe  california facility are often sole sourced to its customers  the company s operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of its major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders  that orders by existing customers will not be canceled or will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
product liability exposure and availability of insurance 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products being developed by the company involve an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
while no product liability claims have been made against the company to date  if any such claims were made and adverse judgments obtained  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company has taken and intends to continue to take what it believes are appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims  there can be no assurance that it will avoid significant liability

introduction of the euro 
on january   certain member states of the european economic community fixed their respective currencies to a new currency  commonly known as the euro 
during the three years beginning on january   business in these countries will be conducted both in the existing national currency  as well as the euro 
companies operating in or conducting business in these countries will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies and the euro 
based on the current level of direct european business conducted by the company  and also because the company expects that any transactions in europe in the near future will be priced in us dollars  the company does not expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect the company s business 
the company will continue to evaluate the impact over time of the introduction of the euro 
however  if the company encounters unexpected opportunities or difficulties in europe  the company s business could be adversely affected  including the inability to bill customers and to pay suppliers for transactions denominated in the euro and the inability to properly record transactions denominated in the euro in the company s financial statements

the company has certain key relationships with customers  vendors and outside service providers 
the company is primarily relying upon the voluntary disclosures from third parties for this review of their year readiness 
failure by the company s key customers  vendors and outside service providers to adequately address the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results
