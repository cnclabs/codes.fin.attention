item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based on and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
all amounts referred to herein that refer directly to our financial statement balances or are otherwise drawn directly from our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto are stated in constant r in accordance with us gaap 
background brazilian political environment the brazilian political environment has been marked by high levels of uncertainty since the country returned to civilian rule in after years of military government 
the death of a president in and the resignation of another president in the midst of impeachment proceedings in  as well as rapid turnover at and immediately below the cabinet level  have adversely affected the implementation of consistent economic and monetary policies  including consistent policies in the areas of government owned enterprises and telecommunications 
measures by the government intended to influence the course of brazil s economy eg actions to control inflation  interest rates or consumption have been frequent and occasionally drastic 
changes in policy  social instability or other political or economic developments  and the government s responses to such developments  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
mr 
fernando henrique cardoso was elected president of brazil in october and took office in january for a single four year term 
he has generally sought to continue the economic stabilization and liberalization policies he developed as finance minister from may through april under president itamar franco 
president cardoso is the leader of a coalition of political parties that represents a majority of the federal congress 
brazil s constitution was amended in to permit president cardoso to stand for re election to a second four year term 
although president cardoso s policies appear to have broad political support and he was re elected in october for another four year term  his policies have suffered major setbacks  including the failure of brazil s congress to pass social security reform and various austerity measures on government spending 
there can be no assurance that president cardoso s policies will not be revised in whole or in part at some future date 
furthermore  some important groups remain opposed to significant elements of his program  and the implementation of any policies of economic stabilization or liberalization is subject to significant compromises and accommodations 
economic environment our financial condition and results of operations are dependent on general economic conditions in brazil  and in particular on 
economic growth and its impact on demand for fast food services  and 
exchange rates between brazilian and foreign currencies 
historically  the brazilian economy has been extremely volatile  and the government has implemented a succession of programs intended to stabilize the economy and provide a basis for sustainable  non inflationary growth 
we have been affected by such programs in a variety of ways  particularly when such programs have resulted in contractions in demand or very high real interest rates 
beginning in december  the government introduced the real plan  an economic stabilization program intended to reduce the rate of inflation by reducing certain public expenditures  collecting liabilities owed to the government  increasing tax revenues  continuing to privatize government owned entities and introducing a new currency 
the real was introduced as brazil s currency in july  based on a monetary correction index  the urv  introduced earlier in the year 
since taking office in january  president cardoso has continued to implement the real plan 
under the real plan  the rate of inflation has decreased significantly  and the rate of growth of real gross domestic product has increased substantially 
since mid  brazil has faced continuing deficits in its payment balance and  simultaneously  the market began to doubt the government s capability to reduce public spending 
based on these and other reasons  including massive outflows of foreign capital in the first two weeks of january  brazil devalued its currency 
brazil and the imf have recently reached an agreement whereby brazil would receive  under certain conditions such as minimum level of country reserves and reversal of public spending deficit  a billion bail out package 
the long term effects upon brazil in general and upon us in particular of the real plan and the devaluation and success of the bail out package  are uncertain 
effects of inflation and devaluation brazil has experienced extremely high and generally unpredictable rates of inflation and of devaluation of brazilian currency for many years 
since the introduction of the real plan in july  the rate of inflation has decreased considerably 
as measured through by the unidade fiscal de referencia the ufir and by the indice geral de precos mercado the igp m thereafter  the annualized rate of inflation was  for the first six months of  for the last six months of and for the year  with significantly all of s inflation occurring during the first six months of that year 
the annual rate of inflation during was mainly due to the effects of the brazilian currency devaluation as compared to and in and  respectively 
inflation in is expected to be high with experts predicting an annual rate of inflation of between and due to the lingering effects of brazil s economic recession  the size of the public deficit and the difficulty to sustain external reserves 
the following table sets forth brazilian inflation  as measured by the ufir igp m  and the devaluation of the brazilian currency against the us dollar for the periods shown 
year ended december  inflation ufir igp m devaluation brazilian currency annualized rates our results of operations in have been affected by inflation  and such financial information should be evaluated in light of the methodology for recognition of the effects of inflation 
significant effects include the following 
effects of purchasing power gains and losses on revenues 
inflation produces purchasing power losses on accounts receivable between the date of service and the date of payment by the customer 
these losses are partly offset by purchasing power gains on accounts payable and accrued expenses  value added taxes and other taxes on operating revenues between the date of accrual and the date of payment 

effects of inflation on financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
we have both assets and liabilities that are financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
until july   the indexation of principal was provided for according to the index specified in the relevant instrument subsequent to that time  only interest was impacted by indexation 
as of july   we determined that brazil no longer had a hyperinflationary economy as defined in sfas and ceased indexing our consolidated financial statements for constant currency purchasing power 
in our consolidated financial statements  interest income or expense is reported net of the associated inflationary losses or gains  respectively  and accordingly depends on the relationship between the rate of interest and  where applicable  indexation of principal and the rate of inflation as measured by the ufir  which is used to determine inflationary gains and losses 
for example  indebtedness denominated in reais gives rise to interest expense to the extent that the rates of interest plus indexation exceed the rate of inflation  and it may give rise to negative interest expense if the rates of interest plus indexation are less than the rate of inflation 

effects of inflation and devaluation on indebtedness denominated in foreign currency 
at december   we had r  of indebtedness denominated principally in us dollars 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not hedge its obligations under its foreign currency denominated indebtedness 
in our consolidated financial statements  the interest expense attributable to foreign currency denominated indebtedness is reported net of the associated inflationary gain and foreign exchange loss 
when the rate of inflation and the rate of devaluation differ substantially  the effect on reported interest expense can be substantial 
our financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and accordingly recognize certain effects of inflation and restate data from prior periods in constant reais of june  purchasing power 
such restatement has been effected using the integral restatement method correcao integral required by the cvm the brazilian securities commission to be used for financial statements of public corporations 
in periods of inflation  monetary assets generate inflationary loss  and monetary liabilities generate inflationary gain  due to the decline in purchasing power of the currency 
inflationary gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities have been allocated to their corresponding income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
inflationary gains or losses without a corresponding income or expense caption have been allocated to other net operating income expense 
results of operations since the implementation of real plan in june  the brazilian economy has experienced declining levels of inflation rates  with a cumulative inflation rate for the three year period from july to june  as measured by the igp m of 
the inflation rate since june  and through december  as measured by the igp m  was approximately per annum 
considering the above  and notwithstanding new inflationary pressures now facing brazil  we have made the determination that brazil should no longer be considered a highly inflationary economy from july  onward  pursuant to fasb accordingly  operating results for the period ended december  presented in the accompanying financial statements have been indexed and expressed in currency of constant purchasing power of june  by using a monthly index derived from igp m index 
the company believes that the igp m index is an appropriate general price inflation indicator to be used under us gaap 
from july   we no longer indexed our financial statements for constant currency purchasing power

the decrease in sales was partially offset by an overall increase in selling prices  introduction of new lines of bacon and chicken products  an improved incentive program for store personnel and the improvement  particularly in the fourth quarter of  of the brazilian economy 
franchise income franchise income was r  r  and r  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases of  and in  and  respectively  are primarily due to the expansion of franchised locations  which increased from an average of units in to units in to units in at december   and  we had  and franchised points of sale  respectively 
the increase in the number of franchisees resulted in increases in initial fees charged to new franchisees and royalty fees 
through the period from january  to december  we sold of our restaurants to franchisees in  in and in 
these stores had either low profitability or  in some cases  operating losses 
our historical experience has shown that franchisee administration can enhance the profitability of such stores  primarily as a result of 
lower taxation tax incentives from federal and state governments to small companies  
better knowledge of specific markets and their local customs  and 
lower operating expenses 
in some situations  we have provided incentives in the form of reduced royalties to franchisees for a period of time 
other income other income was r  r  and r  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is comprised of income derived from suppliers pursuant to license as well as exclusivity agreements  from marketing fees and initial fees paid by new franchisees 
the increase throughout these years is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of franchised outlets  discussed above  which was partially offset by termination of a joint publicity agreement in april cost of restaurant sales cost of restaurant sales expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were  and the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of restaurant sales expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to an approximately increase in the cost of imported food products and paper goods following the january brazilian currency devaluation and from a sales tax increase 
restaurant payroll and other employee benefits restaurant payroll and other employee benefits expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and  and as a percentage of restaurant sales in the same periods 
despite annual salary increases mandated by union driven agreements in  in  in for rio de janeiro employees and in  in and in  for sao paulo employees  implementation of lower night shift wages  change of medical care scheme and transportation benefits for new employees and reduced daily hours of employment for store personnel have resulted in a net reduction of such expenses 
restaurant occupancy costs and other expenses restaurant occupancy costs and other expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
restaurant occupancy costs and other expenses expressed as percentage of restaurant sales were approximately  and for the years ended december   and the increase is mainly due to the portion of minimum rent which is linked to the brazilian inflation rate  and per annum in  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues was approximately   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and  and as a percentage of restaurant sales in the same periods 
depreciation and amortization remained in a constant level from year to year 
other operating expenses other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales were approximately  and for the years ended december   and the slight increase from to was mainly attributable to the effect of annual inflationary adjustments of service contracts  partially professional service contracts covering such tasks as repair  maintenance and money collections and the assumption by franchisees of certain special event expenses offset by negotiated reductions and non renewals of certain of contracts 
selling expenses selling expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and se for the years ended december   and  and  and for the same period as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the increase in when compared to is due to the growth in the number of franchised stores 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and  and for the same period as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the decrease is mainly attributable to 
a total headcount reduction of administrative employees including senior managers and managers in 
non recurring expenses incurred in the first nine months of of approximately r  related to labor compensation on dismissal of administrative personnel 
restructuring of our middle management  including i the outsourcing of some departments in order to reduce administrative charges since november and ii the optimization of some functions and positions 
relocation of our executive and principal administrative offices to a owned facility in july 
the termination of an accounting service agreement in september with a total net saving of approximately r  per month impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of  we determined  based upon our evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows that an impairment of our goodwill existed and took a charge of r  interest income and expenses interest income and expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income and expenses expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the approximately brazilian currency devaluation and to an increase in our indebtedness level 
liquidity and capital resources since march   we have funded our operating losses of r  and made acquisitions of businesses and capital improvements including store remodeling by using cash remaining at the closing of our acquisition of venbo  by borrowing funds from various sources and private placements of securities 
as of december   we had cash on hand of r  and a working capital deficiency of r  our capital requirements are primarily for expansion of our retail operations 
currently  of our stores are in owned facilities and all the others are in leased facilities 
for the year ended december   our ebitda was r  during the same period  our average cost to open a store approximated r  to r  including leasehold improvements  equipment and beginning inventory  as well as expenses for store design  site selection  lease negotiation  construction supervision and obtaining permits 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for fiscal  which will be used to maintain our restaurant network  will approximate r  we anticipate that our primary use of our cash resources during will be to service our debt obligations 
during  we intend to focus our efforts on expanding both the number of our franchisees and our franchised outlets  neither of which are expected to involve significant capital expenditures by us 
in the year ended december   we had net cash provided by operating activities of r  and had net cash provided by investing activities of r  the primary use of cash for investing activities was for capital expenditures related to our retail store expansion 
we plan to address our immediate and future cash flow needs to include focusing on a number of areas including 
the sale of certain of our owned and operated stores  
reduction of expenses  including headcount reductions  
the expansion of our franchisee base  which may be expected to generate additional cash flows from royalties and franchise fees without significant capital expenditure  and 
the introduction of new programs and menu expansions to meet consumer wishes 
in order to act on these plans and sustain current operations  we are dependent upon the continued forbearance of our creditors  as well as upon additional financing 
there can be no assurance that our plans will be realized  or that additional financing will be available to us when needed  or at terms that are desirable 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will locate suitable new franchisees  or desirable locations for new franchisees to open stores 
our ability to further reduce expenses and head count is directly impacted by our need to maintain an infrastructure to support our current and future changing of locations 
our ability to re market our owned stores to franchisees  and to generate cash flows from such activities  is impacted by the ability to locate suitable buyers with the interest and capital to complete such transactions  and the time to complete such sales 
additionally  our ability to achieve our plans is further impacted by the instability of the economic environment in brazil  which has a direct impact on the desire and ability of consumers to visit fast food outlets 
we are also dependent upon the continued employment of key personnel 
these factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
year status we believe that we have adequately addressed the year issue  having experienced no failures or disruptions in our internal operating systems or affecting any of our third party vendors or suppliers either on or after january  it is possible  however  that future failures or disruptions stemming from year issues may yet result in our inability to process transactions  accept customer orders or timely provide customers with our products 
quantitative and qualitative information about market risk we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not purchase hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
we have issued no debt instruments  entered into no forward or future contracts  purchased no options and entered into no swaps 
our primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in brazilian interest rates would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds under our several credit facilities with brazilian banks and financial institutions
