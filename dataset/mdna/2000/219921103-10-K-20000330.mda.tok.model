contribution from operations consists of revenues minus operating expenses and start up costs 
contribution from operations  in general  is lower in the initial stages of a facility s operations

the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from to was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses from a number of facilities that were in their early stages of operations during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of and were experiencing less than optimal utilization rates 
depending on their cost structure  facilities that are experiencing less than utilization rates generally incur significantly higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue compared to those at or near capacity 
a portion of the decrease was also attributable to lower costs for resident and operating expenses as a result of the company s ability to negotiate better rates due to its increased size after the merger

the effective tax rate was in and in the effective tax benefit rates are due primarily to the non recognition in the period of the tax benefit on certain current period expense items due to uncertainties of realizability and to the non deductibility of a large component of goodwill in the period related to the behavioral health programs which was included in the loss on sale of the behavioral health business 
the fluctuations in the effective tax rates are also due to the effect of not recording a tax provision on the earnings of cci due to their subchapter s status during those periods

this credit facility was repaid in august of with proceeds from a new credit facility with summit bank as described below 
on august   the company finalized a new million financing arrangement with summit bank  na  a new jersey based national bank 
borrowings under the line are subject to compliance with financial covenants and borrowing base criteria

the million revolving line of credit and the  operating lease financing facility mature on august  they bear a variable rate of interest on a margin over the base rate or libor rate 
the margin is determined by the ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda and ranges from 
to for base rate and from to for libor rate loans 
the company has the discretionary ability to elect either base rate or libor rate loans 
the million delayed drawdown line matures three years after the earlier of august  or the date in which the credit facility equals the million commitment balance 
this credit facility bears interest at over the base rate through december  over the base rate from january  to march  and over the base rate thereafter 
the company is required to pay the outstanding principal balance in twelve equal quarterly installments beginning three months after the earlier of august  or the date in which the credit facility equals the million commitment balance 
simultaneously with the closing of these new credit facilities  the company used approximately  of the available credit under the revolving line of credit facility to discharge all of its outstanding line of credit banking indebtedness to nationsbank  na  fees related to the financing and repayment of other indebtedness 
subsequent to the closing  the company paid this revolving credit line down to  due to borrowing base limitations  the available balance at december  was approximately additionally  in connection with the closing of the new credit facilities  the company used approximately  of its available credit under the lease credit facility to discharge its obligations to nationsbank under a similar financing vehicle previously provided by nationsbank to the company

that portion to be refinanced through the delayed drawdown instrument that is expected to be paid during the year  in accordance with the loan provisions  has been classified as current 
youth services international  inc incurred approximately  of direct costs in connection with the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures 
these costs were included within deferred debt issue costs for and amortized over the life of the debentures 
the remaining balance at december  was expensed as part of the merger related charges in subordinated promissory notes through a series of transactions that closed in july  august and september  the company issued  units at  per unit  in a private placement of its securities private placement

in addition  the company expects to continue to have cash needs as it relates to financing start up costs in connection with new contracts 
in addition the company is continuing to evaluate opportunities  which could require significant outlays of cash 
if such opportunities were pursued  the company would require additional financing resources 
management believes these additional resources may be available through alternative financing methods 
risk factors decreases in occupancy levels at our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business 
while the cost structures of the facilities we operate are relatively fixed  a substantial portion of our revenues are generated under facility management contracts with government agencies that specify a net rate per day per inmate or a per diem rate  with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
under this per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are each dependent upon the governmental agencies with which we have management contracts to provide inmates for  and maintain the occupancy level of  our managed facilities 
we cannot control those occupancy levels 
in addition  our ability to estimate and control our costs with respect to all of these contracts is critical to our profitability 
during  ysi experienced a significant decline in the occupancy levels of certain of its facilities  which has caused its contributions from operations to decline 
occupancy levels may decline at ysi s or csc s facilities in the future and new facilities might not reach occupancy levels required to produce profitability 
the non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts  which generally range from one to three years  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as is typical in our industry  our facility management contracts are short term  generally ranging from one to three years  with renewal or extension options in favor of the contracting governmental agency 
many ysi contracts renew annually 
our facility management contracts may not be renewed or our customers may terminate such contracts in accordance with their right to do so 
the non renewal or termination of any of these contracts could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
of the ysi multi year contracts in place as of december   four contracts representing approximately beds are up for renewal in the contracts up for renewal in include the five year contract for the operation of the charles h 
hickey  jr 
school in maryland for beds for which ysi was selected the successful bidder in february of the csc multi year contracts in place as of december   csc has fourteen contracts for a total of  beds subject to renewal in a contracting governmental agency often has a right to terminate a facility contract with or without cause by giving us adequate notice 
often a contracting government agency notifies us that we are not in compliance with certain provisions of a facility contract 
our failure to cure any such noncompliance could result in termination of the facility contract  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
if a governmental agency does not receive necessary appropriations  it could terminate its contract or reduce the management fee payable to us 
even if funds are appropriated  delays in payments may occur which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we currently lease many of the facilities that we manage 
if a management contract for a leased facility were terminated  we would continue to be obligated to make lease payments until the lease expires 
we face financial risks relating to speculative projects  including the loss of initial outlays on contracts not awarded to us 
in some cases  we may decide to construct and own a facility without a contract award when we believe there is a need for the facility and a strong likelihood we will be awarded a contract 
however  we take the risk that a contract may not be awarded 
if contracts do not materialize  the initial outlays may be lost 
our ability to secure new contracts to develop and manage correctional detention facilities depends on many factors we cannot control 
our growth is generally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new correctional and detention facilities 
this depends on a number of factors we cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions and acceptance of privatization 
certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project  a trend which will require the combined company to have sufficient capital resources to compete effectively 
we may not be able to obtain these capital resources when needed 
we face risks and uncertainties in expanding our operations outside of the united states and its territories  including new and unfamiliar regulatory requirements  currency exchange issues  political and economic issues  and staffing and managing these operations 
our business plan includes the possible expansion of our operations into markets outside of the united states and its territories 
we may not succeed in entering any of these markets  and if we are successful  we will be subject to the risks of international operations 
these risks include various new and unfamiliar regulatory requirements  issues relating to currency exchange  political and economic changes and disruptions  tariffs or other barriers  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations 
we may not be able to achieve the growth we anticipate  or if achieved  we may not be able to effectively manage it 
csc has experienced significant growth and expects that the combined company will also continue to grow 
successful growth depends on our ability to obtain and train qualified personnel to handle the increasing number of juveniles and adults in our care  to develop and operate the information technology systems and financial controls necessary to manage expanded operations  to manage our resources over a larger base of programs and activities  and to integrate efficiently and effectively the business and financial functions of any newly developed programs 
we may not be able to achieve the growth anticipated or  if achieved  we may not be able to effectively manage it 
future acquisitions may involve special risks  including possible adverse short term effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention from existing business  dependence on key personnel  unanticipated liabilities and costs of amortization of intangible assets 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect us 
the combined company also intends to grow through selective acquisitions of companies and individual facilities although there are no current plans or agreements to acquire any other companies 
we may not be able to identify or acquire any new company or facility and we may not be able to profitably manage acquired operations 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible adverse short term effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention from existing business  dependence on retaining  hiring and training key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated liabilities  and the costs of amortization of acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
public resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in our inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
the operation of correctional and detention facilities by private entities is a relatively new concept and has not achieved complete acceptance by either governments or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions and others that believe that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by governmental agencies 
political changes or changes in attitudes toward private correctional and detention facilities management in any market in which we will operate could result in significant changes to the previous acceptance of privatization in such market and the subsequent loss of facility management contracts 
further  some sectors of the federal government and some state and local governments are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional operating responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
our failure to comply with unique governmental regulation could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts 
the industry in which we operate is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulations  including education  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by many regulatory authorities 
some of the regulations are unique to our industry  and the combination of regulations we face is unique 
we may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply can result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of our facility management contracts 
our contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements  and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of the contracting governmental agencies 
corrections officers and youth care workers are customarily required to meet certain training standards and  in some instances  facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
our businesses also are subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which we have contracts 
the outcomes of these audits could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the loss of any csc executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the combined company 
the success of our operations will depend upon the continued services of csc s executive management  including james f 
slattery  chairman  chief executive officer and president  michael garretson  executive vice president  and ira cotler  executive vice president and chief financial officer 
the loss of any of these executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the combined company 
we may encounter material costs relating to year compliance 
many existing computer programs were designed to use only two digits to identify a year in the date field without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year csc management has completed a corporate program  which we believe has prepared all csc s computer systems and applications for the year csc expects no material incremental infrastructure costs to be incurred as a result of these enhancements 
ysi expects to implement the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues with respect to its internal systems without significant expense 
in the event the merger is completed  management anticipates that csc s computer systems would be utilized for both companies 
although ysi believes it will be year compliant and that the cost will not have a material adverse effect  ysi may not in fact be year compliant by year  whether or not the merger is completed  and the cost of year remediation may have a material adverse effect on ysi s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also rely  directly and indirectly  on external systems of business enterprises such as strategic partners  suppliers  financial organizations  research facilities and governmental entities  both domestic and international  for accurate exchange of data 
even if our internal systems are not materially affected by the year computer programming issue  we could be affected by disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which we interact 
disturbances at one or more of our facilities could result in closure of these facilities by the relevant governmental entities and a loss of our contracts to manage these facilities 
an escape  riot or other disturbance at one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
among other things  the adverse publicity generated as a result any such event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event occurs  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental entity 
a closure of any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable to cover potential liability related to management of correctional and detention facilities 
our management of correctional and detention facilities exposes us to potential third party claims or litigation by prisoners or other persons for personal injury or other damages  including damages resulting from contact with our facilities  programs  personnel or students including students who leave our facilities without our authorization and cause bodily injury or property damage 
currently  we are subject to actions initiated by former employees  inmates and detainees alleging assault  sexual harassment  personal injury  property damage  and other injuries 
in addition  our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation 
we maintain insurance programs that provide coverage for certain liability risks faced by us  including personal injury  bodily injury  death or property damage to a third party where we are found to be negligent 
there is no assurance  however  that our insurance will be adequate to cover potential third party claims 
in addition  we are unable to secure insurance for some unique business risks including riot and civil commotion or the acts of an escaped offender 
committed offenders often seek redress in federal courts pursuant to federal civil rights statutes for alleged violations of their constitutional rights caused by the overall condition of their confinement or by specific conditions or incidents 
we may be subject to liability if any such claim or proceeding is made or instituted against us or the state with which we contract or subcontract
