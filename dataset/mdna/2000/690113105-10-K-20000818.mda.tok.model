general factors because of the project oriented nature of the company s business  the company s largest clients have historically tended to vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for these clients 
during fiscal  sales to the company s three largest clients accounted for of net sales 
during fiscal  sales to those same three clients accounted for of net sales from continuing operations 
for a discussion regarding client concentration and marketing factors see item clients and marketing  which is incorporated herein by reference 
the company performs various services on behalf of these clients  such as  printing  production of labels and contract packaging 
changes in the company s project mix and timing of projects make predictability of the company s future results very difficult 
changes in the company s project mix and client base could affect future sales volume and profitability 
even though the company is looking to increase longer term contract work  the company expects that it will continue to experience significant sales concentration given the relatively large size of projects undertaken for certain clients 
furthermore  the company s largest clients may vary from year to year depending on the number and size of the projects completed for such clients 
the loss of one or more principal clients or a change in the number or character of projects for particular clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 
clients generally purchase the company s services under cancelable purchase orders rather than long term contracts  although exceptions sometimes occur when the company is required to purchase substantial inventories or special machinery to meet orders 
the company believes that operating without long term contracts is consistent with industry practices  although it increases the company s vulnerability to losses of business and significant period to period changes 
the company uses complex and specialized equipment to provide its services  and manufacture its products 
therefore  the company is dependent upon the functioning of such machinery  and its ability to acquire and maintain appropriate equipment 
liquidity and capital resources as shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows  fiscal cash provided from operating activities was million as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  the company used million to acquire property plant and equipment 
in addition  the company used cash to pay down an additional million of long term debt and purchased million of treasury stock 
in june  the acquisition of star labels by the company was financed with cash generated from internal operations 
the company s operating cash was reduced by a million increase in accounts and notes receivable 
the company s operating cash was reduced by a million increase in inventory and a million decrease in accounts payable 
during fiscal the company provided million for additional reserves and write downs of receivables and inventory as compared to million in fiscal the company continues to monitor its inventory requirements and the credit worthiness of its clients 
management continues its program to reduce inventory to desired levels 
inventory at may  reflects higher than levels due to the level of raw material required to be on hand for client production runs 
earlier than planned receipts of raw material inventory in order to receive volume pricing  as well as increased order quantities to minimize anticipated price increases also contributed to the higher inventory level 
net cash used in financing activities was million  of which approximately million represents the company s net reduction of debt 
the company also used million to purchase treasury stock 
the company was able to reduce its debt as a result of cash available from improved management of operations and working capital 
the company holds notes receivable from the purchasers of its barrier operations that total approximately million 
the company is currently in litigation to collect those amounts  and the other party is making claims against the company  including seeking termination of the note 
see item legal proceedings 
the company is also in the process of litigation to collect another note that totals approximately million 
a failure of the company to collect these amounts  or amounts due under other notes or accounts receivable  in excess of reserves  would adversely affect the company s balance sheet and results of operations 
the company maintains a credit facility with a bank  but had no outstanding balances on the revolver as of may  at august  the company had an outstanding revolving loan balance of million 
these borrowings were used to temporarily finance the acquisition of a new press that will be permanently financed through a long term lease arrangement 
the facility provides for a maximum revolving credit commitment of million less approximately million used for standby letters of credit 
interest on the debt outstanding during the year varied with the company s selection to have the debt based upon margins over the bank determined preference or an ibor rate 
the company s actual rate is dependent upon the company s performance against a specific ratio as measured against a predetermined performance chart 
the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  excluding any acquisition opportunities that may become available to the company 
the company intends to finance these expenditures through funds obtained from operations plus its credit facilities and possible leasing opportunities 
in july the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
no timeframe was set for completion of this program 
as of august  the company had repurchased  shares for approximately million 
the company regularly reassesses how its various operations complement the company as a whole and considers strategic decisions to acquire new operations or expand  terminate or sell certain existing operations 
these reviews resulted in the transactions discussed above during recent fiscal years  and may result in additional transactions during fiscal and beyond 
recently issued financial accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas established standards for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
the effective application date of this standard has been deferred by the release of fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
fas defers application of fas to the company s fiscal year 
at this time  the company does not have any derivatives or hedging activities that would be affected by fas during  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
the sab is effective for the company s fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the bulletin and the reporting implications thereof 
at this time  the company does not expect this will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
other in general  the company believes that the effects of inflation on the company have not been material in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities may include forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed 
the company has financial instruments  including notes receivable and long term debt  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
however  the company does not use any interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to limit its sensitivity to changes in interest rates because of the relatively short term nature of its notes receivable and variability of interest rates on certain of its long term debt 
the company does not believe there has been any material changes in the reported market risks faced by the company since the end of its last fiscal year  may
