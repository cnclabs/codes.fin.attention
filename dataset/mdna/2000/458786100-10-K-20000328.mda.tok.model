amtech systems is a supplier of wireless data technologies for electronic toll collection  rail and motor fleet tracking  and access control to parking and other structures 
depreciation and amortization increased from million to million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to higher amortization of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from the norand and ubi acquisitions  as well as additional depreciation from capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  however  as a percentage of sales  sg a remained constant at in both years

foreign currency transactions the company is subject to the effects of international currency fluctuations due to the global nature of its operations 
currency transaction net losses for the year ended december  were million  net of taxes 
currency transaction gains and losses for the years ended december  and were not significant 
it is not possible to predict the company s exposure to foreign currency fluctuations beyond the near term because revenues generated from particular foreign jurisdictions vary widely over time 
for fiscal year  the company derived approximately of its revenues and of its operating profits exclusive of corporate overhead from non us operations 
at december   identifiable assets attributable to foreign operations comprised of total assets 
as the largest components of these foreign assets are attributable to european operations  the exposure of identifiable assets to foreign currency fluctuations or expropriations is not significant 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities increased from million at december  to million at december  total debt decreased from million at december  to million at december  improved working capital management provided funds from operations that were utilized to repay borrowings 
the company has two unsecured committed credit facilities with banks from which it may borrow up to million

including underwriting fees  discounts and effects of forward rate agreements  the effective interest rates on the seven year and ten year notes are and  respectively 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used by the company to repay outstanding debt 
the company expects that cash flow from operations  along with available borrowing capacity  will be adequate to meet working capital requirements 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs designed to define a year using two digits rather than four 
as such  a date sensitive field using could be recognized as the year rather than the year  potentially causing a system failure or other business disruption 
the operating segments of the company formed internal review teams that assessed the company s exposure to year problems 
as a result of these reviews  non year compliant information technology and non information technology systems were identified 
the company completed modifications or replacements and testing to achieve year compliance utilizing both internal and external resources 
in addition  the company actively worked with its significant suppliers and customers to assess their year compliance efforts and the company s exposure from them 
the company also assessed the capability of its products to determine whether they are year compliant 
the company believes that all of its current products are year compliant 
unova has not tested products that are no longer sold by the company and the company does not believe it is legally responsible for costs incurred by customers related to ensuring their year capability 
however  the company is providing customer support services related to year issues 
unova defines year compliant as a product that  when used properly and in conformity with the product information provided by the company  will accurately convey data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  including leap year calculations  provided that all other technology used in combination with the product properly exchanges data with the unova product 
management is not aware of any significant adverse effects of year on the systems and operations of the company 
through december   the total cumulative cost of these year compliance activities was approximately million 
of these costs  approximately million were expensed and the remaining million were capitalizable 
management does not anticipate significant additional year costs 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that year issues had or will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operations 
however  the year problem has potential consequences  some of which are not reasonably foreseeable  and there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not arise 
while management believes that no customer  vendor  or service provider is individually significant to the company s operations  we have no information that indicates a significant customer may be unable to purchase from the company  a significant vendor may be unable to sell to the company  or a significant service provider may be unable to provide services to the company  in each case because of year compliance problems 
while the company currently does not anticipate problems related to third party year issues  the company will continue to assess potential risk from third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that year problems originating with a customer  vendor  service provider or other third party will not occur 
inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from its short term and long term borrowings and to exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates the information presented below summarizes the company s cash flows for its borrowings and related interest rates by dates of maturity 
variable interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rates of the borrowings at december  fair values for fixed rate borrowings have been determined based on quoted market prices 
the fair values for variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value 
the information presented below should be read in conjunction with note c to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
debt thereafter total fair value thousands of dollars fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate      average interest rate foreign exchange rates due to its global operations  the company s cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
as of december   the company held short term contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency cash flows with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company does not enter into any foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges and  accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market are recorded currently in earnings 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at december  would not result in a material gain or loss 
additionally  any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  should be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item
