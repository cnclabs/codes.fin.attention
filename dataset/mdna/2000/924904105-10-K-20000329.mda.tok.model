since the ipo  vestcom has acquired eight additional companies that create  manage and distribute business critical documents collectively with the founding companies referred to herein as acquired companies 
the acquired companies were managed prior to their acquisition as independent private companies  and their results of operations reflect different tax structures s corporations and c corporations for the us acquired companies  which have influenced  among other things  the acquired companies historical levels of owners compensation

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  in s revenues increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the full year effect of acquisitions which accounted for approximately  or  of such increase 
the remainder of the increase  or approximately  was attributable to internal growth over revenues 
this internal growth  of  was due to increased sales to new and existing customers primarily in the financial services and retail markets 
the company s internal growth rate accelerated in the fourth quarter of due to the company s consolidation and integration plan 
vestcom s gross profit increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to acquisitions which accounted for  or  of such increase  offset by increased costs and duplicate expenses incurred as the company consolidated its operation and excess capacity in its fulfillment operations 
these costs caused gross margins to decrease from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expenses increased from in to in the increase was attributable in part to acquisitions which accounted for approximately  or  of such increase

the restructuring plan does not contemplate the company eliminating any of its current products or services  the consolidations are designed to make the company s existing businesses more efficient 
interest expense increased  or  from for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased borrowings on the company s credit facility to finance acquisitions  equipment purchases  leasehold improvements and payments related to earnout agreements 
year ended december  compared to unaudited pro forma year ended december  in s vestcom  which conducted no operations prior to the consummation of the ipo other than in connection with the acquisitions of the founding companies and the financing activities  related thereto  including the ipo  had no revenues and limited corporate expenses in the first seven months of therefore  management s discussion and analysis based on actual results would compare twelve months of operating activity in to five months of operating activity in accordingly  management believes that management s discussion and analysis would only be meaningful based on a comparison of the audited results of operations of vestcom for the year ended december  to the unaudited pro forma results of operations of vestcom for the year ended december  the unaudited pro forma data gives effect to i the acquisitions of the founding companies and those companies acquired in  and ii compensation and other adjustments for all transactions in as if the transactions had occurred on january  the following discussion of pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results vestcom would have obtained had all of these acquisitions actually then occurred or of vestcom s actual or future results 
actual unaudited pro forma audited results of operations in thousands in thousands revenues   gross profit   selling  general administrative expenses   income from operations   revenues increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions which accounted for  or of revenues and  or internal growth over revenues 
this internal growth was due to increased sales to new and existing customers primarily in the financial services and retail markets 
vestcom s gross profit increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions which accounted for approximately  with the remaining increase relating to the increased volume of business 
the gross profit margin decreased from in to in primarily due to the renegotiation of certain capital lease obligations with one of vestcom s vendors which reclassified certain of the obligations from capital leases to operating leases 
this transaction resulted in expense being moved from interest expense to cost of revenue thereby reducing the gross profit in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expenses increased from in to in the increase was attributable in part to acquisitions which accounted for approximately  or of the total increase

these costs included redundant overhead and facility costs 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources reflects vestcom s actual results of operations and financial position for the periods discussed 
at december   vestcom had working capital of approximately  compared to  at december  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable which reflects the increased sales activity

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately  which consisted primarily of  of cash used for acquisitions and approximately  used for the purchase of property and equipment

vestcom incurs postage costs on behalf of customers of approximately  to  each month 
vestcom seeks to collect such postage costs from its customers in advance 
at december   vestcom had postage advances from customers in the amount of approximately  and had prepaid postage and postage receivables of approximately  to the extent vestcom is unsuccessful in obtaining postage costs in advance  cash flow is negatively affected and vestcom may be required to utilize its working capital or credit facility to cover the cash outlay 
capital expenditures of approximately  for property and equipment  leasehold improvements and technology were made in these investments  which were financed primarily by borrowings and vendor financing  relate to the facility consolidations of certain of the acquired companies and the purchase of supplemental production equipment to meet customer demands for business critical documents 
there are anticipated requirements for future capital expenditures in  relating primarily to technology and the anticipated production equipment needs of the business 
at this time  these expenditures are estimated to be approximately  however  as additional revenue generating opportunities arise the company may be required to expend additional capital to support those opportunities 
while no assurance can be given  management believes that its cash flow from operations combined with existing cash and the availability of funds under the credit facility  and potential additional credit capacity  will be sufficient to meet its working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements and its current plans to acquire additional related businesses for the foreseeable future 
the preceding sentence constitutes a forward looking statement

similarly  to management s knowledge  vestcom s suppliers  vendors and other third parties with whom vestcom conducts business have not experienced material year problems to date 
however  the company will continue to monitor its systems throughout the first quarter of the year expenditures incurred by vestcom to evaluate  test  repair and replace equipment were approximately  item a

at december   vestcom s debt consisted of approximately  of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of and  of variable rate debt  which consisted of a libor sixty day loan entered into on december  for  at and  of other variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on vestcom s cash requirements  maximum borrowings at any quarter end during were  if interest rates on such variable debt were to increase by basis points  the net impact on vestcom s results of operations and cash flows would be immaterial
