item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since commencing operations in  we have been engaged principally in the research and development of our product candidates as well as seeking various regulatory clearances and patent protection 
we have had no revenues from product sales and have incurred losses since inception through december  aggregating approximately million 
we have received revenues in connection with various licensing and collaboration agreements 
in august  we entered into a strategic alliance with mallinckrodt pursuant to which we received million in up front license fees 
the agreement provided for an additional million milestone payment  which was received in july in march  we entered into a strategic alliance with daiichi 
under this agreement  we received million in license fees and million from the sale of shares of our preferred stock  and were entitled to receive up to million in future payments based upon our achievement of certain product development milestones 
we received  of such milestone payments in july we expect continued operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to support research  development and efforts to obtain regulatory approvals 
our initial product candidate  angiomark  is currently our only product candidate undergoing human clinical trials 
we filed an ind application for angiomark in july we initiated a phase i clinical trial in and a phase i dose escalation study in  both of which have been completed 
we completed a phase ii clinical trial in june to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of angiomark enhanced mra for the evaluation of pvd and are currently conducting a phase ii feasibility trial to test the safety and feasibility of angiomark enhanced mra for the evaluation of cad 
in addition  in january  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of angiomark for detecting breast cancer 
enrollment in this trial was completed in march in june  we initiated a phase iii clinical trial to determine the efficacy of angiomark enhanced mra for the detection of aiod 
we anticipate fluctuation in our quarterly results of operations due to several factors  including the timing of fees and milestone payments received from strategic partners  the formation of new strategic alliances by us  the timing of expenditures in connection with research and development activities  the timing of product introductions and associated launch  marketing and sales activities  and the timing and extent of product acceptance for different indications and geographical areas of the world 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and were derived from work performed in connection with product development contracts 
the decrease in revenues was due to the timing of cost sharing reimbursements  based on development costs incurred by us and our partners 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increased expenses resulted from higher manufacturing costs of material to be provided to our japanese partner  daiichi  and increased personnel and related costs associated with advancing angiomark through clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the slight increase was due to higher legal costs associated with ongoing patent activities and was partially offset by lower compensation expense and recruiting costs 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  decrease was primarily due to lower average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the increase in interest expense was attributable to a higher average note payable balance outstanding during comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   revenues totaled million and were derived from work performed in connection with product development contracts 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million and included milestone payments of million received from mallinckrodt and  received from daiichi pursuant to collaboration agreements covering our lead product  angiomark 
revenues in also included million for work performed in connection with product development contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase resulted from higher costs associated with advancing angiomark through clinical trials and the addition of personnel and resources to support research in the area of thrombus imaging and further development of our core technology 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase was partially due to additional marketing activities  which included the hiring of personnel and development of marketing communication programs 
also contributing to the increase were higher legal costs related to ongoing patent activities and the hiring of additional support personnel 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  increase was primarily due to higher average levels of invested cash during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in interest expense was unchanged due to the timing of the note payable proceeds  which were received in december year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products or services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that arise are addressed promptly 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception through december  primarily with million in net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february  million from a follow on public offering of common stock in november  million from private sales of equity securities  million received from third parties in connection with collaboration and license arrangements  million of equipment lease financing and million in interest income 
from inception through december   we have incurred million of costs attributable to operating activities  including million related to the research and development of technology and new product candidates  including angiomark 
our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  in october  we entered into a non negotiable promissory note and security agreement the loan with mallinckrodt pursuant to which we are eligible to borrow up to million from mallinckrodt  on a quarterly basis  to cover our share of angiomark development costs 
the loan bears interest  adjustable on a quarterly basis  at the prime rate published in the wall street journal 
the loan is repayable in full on the earliest to occur of i october   ii thirty days after the date of the first commercial sale of licensed product in the territory as such terms are defined in our strategic collaboration agreement with mallinckrodt dated august   as amended the strategic collaboration agreement and iii thirty days after the first date upon which we could reasonably repay all outstanding principal and interest on the loan without creating any reasonably foreseeable risk that we would be otherwise entitled to receive a loan from mallinckrodt under the existing terms of the strategic collaboration agreement within six months of the date of any such repayment 
the loan is secured by a first priority security interest in all of our intellectual property 
although the possibility exists that the loan will become repayable within the next twelve months pursuant to repayment provision iii above  the conditions required to be met by such provision require our speculation concerning both the probability and success of certain future financial transactions 
due to our current uncertainty that such future transactions will occur or will occur such as to cause repayment provision iii above to apply  we have classified the loan as a long term obligation 
we received  pursuant to the loan during november to cover our share of third quarter angiomark development costs 
we are eligible to receive additional payments of million from daiichi upon the attainment of certain future angiomark development milestones 
daiichi is responsible for funding development of angiomark in japan 
under our agreement with mallinckrodt  we and mallinckrodt generally will share equally in future development costs of angiomark up to a specified maximum amount 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million of cash for operating activities  exclusive of license fee revenues 
we expect that our cash needs for operations will increase significantly in future periods due to planned clinical trials and other expenses associated with the development of angiomark and new research and development programs 
we estimate that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and the loan from mallinckrodt will be sufficient to fund our operations through the first quarter of we believe that we will need to raise additional funds for research  development and other expenses  through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances or otherwise  prior to commercialization of any of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both united states and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending to support development of angiomark and new research programs  we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for any future quarterly or annual period prior to commercialization of angiomark 
we anticipate continued investments in fixed assets  including equipment and facilities expansion to support new and continuing research and development programs 
we have in place a lease agreement that will enable us to utilize our current principal scientific facilities through december   and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional three or five years 
we also have a lease for nearby office space  which expires in december we have incurred tax losses to date and therefore have not paid significant federal or state income taxes since inception 
at december   we had loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes resulting from sales of equity securities  our ability to use the loss carryforwards is subject to limitations as defined in sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
we currently estimate that the annual limitation on our use of net operating losses through may  will be approximately  pursuant to sections and of the code  the change in ownership resulting from public equity offerings in and any other future ownership changes may further limit utilization of losses and credits in any one year 
we also are eligible for research and development tax credits that can be carried forward to offset federal taxable income 
the annual limitation and the timing of attaining profitability may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operations

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  we are presently analyzing the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the sab formalizes positions the staff has expressed in speeches and comment letters 
sab is effective no later than the first fiscal quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  while we are presently analyzing the effect on our financial condition or results of operations  we do not anticipate sab will have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national governmental entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
interest income on our investments is recorded as interest income 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
all of the cash equivalents and short term investments are treated as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
while certain of the investment securities had maturities in excess of one year  we may liquidate such securities within one year 
the weighted average interest rate on investment securities at december  was 
the fair market value of securities held at december  was
