liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company s working capital needs have been met through funds generated from operations and from the company s revolving line of credit 
the company s principal need for working capital has been to meet peak inventory and accounts receivable requirements associated with its seasonal sales pattern 
the company increases inventory levels during the spring and summer months in anticipation of increasing shipments in the late summer and fall 
accounts receivable typically increase during the summer and fall because of the company s use of extended payment programs  wherein sales are made to the company s customers for which payment is deferred for one to three months based on the size of the sales orders

under the credit facility  which expires june   the company may borrow up to million from january through june and up to million from july through december 
advances bear interest at one half percentage point above the bank s reference rate at december  
the agreement requires the maintenance of minimum net income amounts and net worth amounts  and provides for various restrictions  including limitations on capital expenditures and additional indebtedness

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which arise during the normal course of business from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk  which is associated with the company s foreign currency transactions  is presented below 
for discussion of market risk associated with long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk the company sells its products in numerous countries around the world  however  except in canada  such sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  the company s uk subsidiary conducts its business in british pound sterling which is its functional currency  although its intercompany payable is denominated in us dollars 
these factors create an exposure to the future earnings of the company when foreign exchange rates change and certain of its receivables as well as its foreign subsidiary s financial statements are denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the company was primarily exposed to the following foreign currencies the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
based upon a hypothetical five percent strengthening of the us dollar across these currencies  the potential foreign exchange losses due to said foreign currency exposures would have been approximately  as of that date 
although the company has used derivatives to hedge this foreign exchange risk  it does not currently hedge this risk nor does it anticipate doing so in the future
