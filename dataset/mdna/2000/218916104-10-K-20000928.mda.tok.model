item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations for cornerstone propane partners  lp and its subsidiary  cornerstone propane  lp collectively cornerstone or the partnership should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the pro forma financial information elsewhere herein 
general the partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed in october to own and operate the propane businesses and assets of syn inc and its subsidiaries synergy  empire energy corporation and its subsidiaries empire  and cgi holdings  inc and its subsidiaries coast 
the partnership s two principal business segments are its retail and coast energy group ceg operations 
the partnership believes it is the fifth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  serving more than  residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers from customer service centers in states 
because a substantial portion of the partnership s propane is used in the weather sensitive residential markets  the heating degree days in the partnership s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  have a significant effect on the financial performance of the partnership 
heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage and are calculated by taking the difference between degrees and the average temperature of the day if less than degrees 
warmer than normal temperatures will generally result in reduced propane use 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes

on november   the partnership refinanced its then existing bank credit facility under the terms of a new bank refunding credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement was subsequently amended effective june  to provide greater flexibility with respect to the financial covenants under the original credit agreement

as of june   million was outstanding under the acquisition facility 
both the working capital facility and the acquisition facility can be extended to november  upon approval of the bank participants in the credit agreement

market risk the partnership has limited exposure to technology risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
strategies and procedures in the normal course of business  the partnership employs various strategies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and changes in commodity prices 
concentration of credit risk the partnership s trade receivables and short term investments do not represent significant concentration of credit risk at june   due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the partnership s products and services are sold 
none of the partnership s customers account for more than of the partnership s revenue or receivable balances at june  short term investments at any single financial institution account for less than of the partnership s current assets 
commodity price risk commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the commodities that the partnership buys and sells and as a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers 
futures and forward contracts are utilized to alter the partnership s exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of propane  natural gas and crude oil 
if commodity prices changed by  the impact on open positions at june  would be approximately million 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to the partnership s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
the partnership enters into hedging instruments to lock into purchases when prices are deemed favorable by management 
interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from having variable rate debt obligations  as changing interest rates impact the partnership s future cash flows and net income 
the partnership s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the partnership maintains the majority of its debt in fixed rate instruments and periodically places some of its floating rate debt under short term fixed rate eurodollar loans 
on the partnership s variable rate debt  a change in interest rates of one percentage point would change interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency rate risk arises from the partnership s canadian operations 
the partnership s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes and to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and activities 
accordingly  the partnership enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities and foreign currency sales 
if foreign exchange rates changed by  projected earnings would change by approximately million due to the translation of earnings in foreign currencies 
it is the partnership s policy to enter into interest rate and foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the partnership does not enter into interest or foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
year readiness disclosure the year issue was the result of computer programs using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
if uncorrected  such computer programs would not have been able to interpret dates correctly beyond the year and  in some cases prior to that time as some computer experts had believed  may have caused computer system failures or other computer errors disrupting business operations 
recognizing the potentially severe consequences of the failure to be year compliant  the partnership s management developed and implemented a company wide program to identify and remedy the year issues 
the partnership used internal and external resources to identify  correct and test large quantities of lines of application software code for systems that were developed internally 
software developed externally had been evaluated for year compliance and was upgraded or replaced 
in addition to internal year remediation activities  the partnership contacted key suppliers  vendors and customers to determine their readiness for the year  surveying each of them about their compliance and contingency plans to supply the partnership upon the approach and arrival of the year due to the actions of the partnership  its vendors and suppliers  there were no disruptions to operations nor additional expenses incurred due to the year systems issues 
through june   the partnership estimates that incremental costs of approximately million were incurred and expensed related to year issues 
since many systems were being modified to provide significant enhanced capabilities  the year expenses were not exclusively planned nor specifically tracked
