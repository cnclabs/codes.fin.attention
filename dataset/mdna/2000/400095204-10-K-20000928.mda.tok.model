you can identify such statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
these statements use words such as believe  expect  should  plan  intend and anticipate 
actual results will be affected by a variety of risks and factors  including  without limitation  international  national and local economic conditions and real estate risks and financing risks 
all such forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates of revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
factors which could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain these results include  among other things 
decline in the volume and prices of real estate transactions 
the company s revenue is largely based on commissions from real estate transactions 
as a result  a decline in the volume of real estate available for lease or sale  or in real estate prices  could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 

general economic slowdown or recession in the real estate markets 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  both on a general or regional basis  will adversely affect certain segments of the company s business 
such economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents and sales prices  a decline in the level of investment in real estate  a decline in the value of real estate investments and an increase in defaults by tenants under their respective leases  all of which in turn would adversely affect revenues from advisory services fees and brokerage commissions which are derived from property sales  aggregate rental payments and property management fees 

the company s debt level and ability to make principal and interest payments 
as a result of the company s strategic initiatives  the company may incur substantial amounts of debt 
any material downturn in the company s revenue or increase in its costs and expenses could render the company unable to meet its debt obligations 

expenses related to initiatives 
as discussed in part i  item of this annual report under strategic initiatives  the company has undertaken  and plans to continue to undertake  a number of strategic initiatives  some of which involve investments in technology systems and people 
the investments related to some or all of these new initiatives may result in significant expenditures by the company 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if these strategic initiatives are unsuccessful 

impact of the internet a real estate advisory firm s ability to deliver quality services depends in part on the collection and dissemination of market information to its clients 
although the role of the internet in the commercial real estate industry is still in its infancy  the risk exists that in the future it will replace some of the functions of the professional real estate advisor in these areas 
this potential competition for certain services may in turn cause a downward pressure on commission rates  and therefore impact the revenues of the company 

risks associated with acquisitions 
as discussed in part i  item i of this annual report under strategic initiatives  the company has completed a number of acquisitions and established a strategic alliance 
there can be no assurance that significant difficulties in integrating operations acquired from other companies and in coordinating and integrating systems in a strategic alliance will not be encountered  including difficulties arising from the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the difficulty associated with assimilating groups of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations and the difficulty in maintaining uniform standards and policies 
there can be no assurance that the integration will ultimately be successful  that the company s management will be able to effectively manage any acquired business or that any acquisition or strategic alliance will benefit the company overall

part i  item i of this annual report under environmental regulation discusses potential risks related to environmental laws and regulations 

the company faces intense competition 
part i  item i of this annual report under competition discusses potential risks related to competition 

the company s revenues are seasonal 
part i  item i of this annual report under seasonality discusses potential risks related to the seasonal nature of the company s business 

the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the growth of the company s business is largely dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of its business

control by existing stockholders 
a single investor beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  this investor can significantly influence the company s affairs and policies and the approval or disapproval of most matters submitted to a vote of the company s stockholders  including the election of directors
