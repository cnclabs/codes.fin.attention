use of the proceeds from the co development fee is restricted to development costs incurred on the phd system and may not be used for other general corporate purposes

the company has recognized million of revenue related to co development of the phd system in research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million in included a one time charge of approximately million 
during  the company determined that the phd systems built for clinical trials  plus additional components to be used for the future manufacture of phd systems  would differ from the version of the phd system that will eventually be commercialized  resulting in the one time charge of approximately million to write those assets down to a carrying value of zero

for the year ended december   interest income was million  compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the company s use of cash to fund operations resulted in a reduction of interest bearing investments and a related decrease in interest income during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through public and private sales of its equity securities 
through december   the company had received net offering proceeds from public and private sales of equity securities of approximately million 
since its inception in through december   the company made million of capital expenditures and used million in cash to support its operations 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  working capital of million and restricted long term investments of million 
the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
the company estimates that during it will spend approximately to million for operations  clinical evaluation and preparation for commercialization of the phd system 
the company expects that substantially all of this amount will be used to i conduct clinical studies using the phd system  and ii develop the next generation phd system to be used for commercialization in the us  japan and worldwide 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial expenses related to manufacturing scale up and commercialization of the phd system and the protection of patent and other proprietary rights 
the company believes that cash and short term investments as of december  are sufficient to finance the company s operations through december   and that additional capital will be required to fund operations beyond december  generally  the company expects us customers to purchase phd systems and enter into contracts whereby the company will provide all products and services related to the phd systems for a single monthly price  which would include all consumables  service and product support 
as an alternative  us customers may enter into lease agreements for the phd systems  under which the single monthly price would also include a lease payment 
the company s present commercialization plan for markets outside of the united states is to develop a partnership in those markets to distribute the phd system and related consumables and service 
financing production of the phd system in quantities necessary for commercialization will require a significant investment in working capital 
this need for working capital is likely to increase to the extent that demand for the phd system increases 
the company would  therefore  have to rely on sources of capital beyond cash generated from operations to finance production of the phd system even if the company were successful in marketing its products and services 
the company currently intends to finance the working capital requirements associated with these arrangements through equipment and receivable financing with a commercial lender 
if the company is unable to obtain such equipment financing  it would need to seek other forms of financing  through the sale of equity securities or otherwise  to achieve its business objectives 
the company has not yet obtained a commitment for such equipment financing  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain equipment financing or alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with obtaining fda clearance or approval  continued progress in research and development  the results of clinical studies  manufacturing scale up  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that the company s plans change  its assumptions change or prove inaccurate or it is unable to obtain production financing on commercially reasonable terms  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
in addition  in the future the company will require substantial additional financing to fund full scale production and marketing of the phd system and related services 
the company has no current arrangements with respect to sources of additional financing 
there can be no assurance that fda clearance or approval will be obtained in a timely manner or at all or that additional financing will be available to the company when needed  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities
