charge for acquired in process technology 
in connection with the purchase of westwood in september  we allocated and expensed  of the  purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
westwood had three major pc projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in the best selling franchise command and conquer and one in the critically acclaimed lands of lore tm series 
as of the acquisition date  costs to complete the westwood projects acquired were expected to be approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we believe there have been no significant changes to these estimates 
we currently expect to complete the development of these projects at various dates through fiscal and to publish the products upon completion 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet our design requirements including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
though we currently expect that the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  there can be no assurance that commercial or technical viability of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the entertainment software industry  changes in computer or video game console technology  changes in other product offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon these plans 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the completion percentage of research and development efforts at the acquisition date  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion percentage  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
the completion percentages were estimated based on cost incurred to date  importance of the completed development tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development is based on unit sales forecasts for worldwide sales territories and adjusted to consider only the revenue related to development achievements completed at the acquisition date 
net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales  marketing and general and administrative expenses and taxes forecasted based on historical operating characteristics 
in addition  net cash flow estimates were adjusted to allow for fair return on working capital and fixed assets  charges for franchise and technology leverage and return on other intangibles 
appropriate risk adjusted discount rates ranging from to were used to discount the net cash flows back to their present value 
the remaining identified intangibles will be amortized on a straight line basis over two to twelve years based on expected useful lives of franchise tradenames  existing products and technologies  retention of workforce  and other intangible assets 
if these projects are not successfully developed  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process research and development projects 
in addition  the value of other acquired intangible assets may also become impaired 
in conjunction with the merger of westwood  we accrued approximately  related to direct transaction costs and other related accruals 
at march   there were  in accruals remaining related to these items 
additionally  for fiscal  the charge for in process research and development also included write offs of  associated with the acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter 
for fiscal  we incurred a charge of  for acquired in process technology in connection with the acquisition of the remaining minority ownership interest in electronic arts victor  inc in december this charge was made after we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles results from the acquisitions of westwood and abc software in the second quarter of fiscal merger costs 
on july   we completed a merger with maxis  inc maxis 
in conjunction with the merger  we recorded costs of  which included direct transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies 
at march   there were no accruals remaining related to these merger costs 
operating income 
operating income increased due to o higher net revenues and related gross profit partially offset by increased operating expenses including the charges for acquired in process technology of  in the current fiscal year 
o partially offset by merger costs of  and a charge for acquired in process technology of  related to the acquisitions in the prior fiscal year 
excluding one time items in both years  as noted above  operating income would have been  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest and other income  net 
the decrease in interest and other income  net  was primarily attributable to the sale of our ownership interest in creative wonders  llc in december the sale resulted in a gain in the prior year of income taxes 
electronic arts effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively affected as there was no tax benefit recorded for a portion of the charges related to the acquired in process technology 
excluding the effect of these charges  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been as compared to a tax rate for fiscal the lower rate of results primarily from a higher portion of international income subject to a lower foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year and an increase in the federal research and experimental credit 
minority interest in consolidate joint venture 
o in the first quarter of fiscal  we formed ea square kk which is seventy percent owned by us and thirty percent owned by square co 
ltd 
square  a leading developer and publisher of entertainment software in japan 
minority interest for fiscal represents square s interest in the net income of ea square kk 
o for fiscal  the minority interest represented the interest in electronic arts victor  inc eav owned by victor entertainment industries  inc vei 
we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in eav held by vei in december net income 
in absolute dollars  reported net income was flat due to the one time charges related to acquisitions offsetting significantly higher operating income

impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except  as amended by sab a  registrants with fiscal years that begin between december  and march  may report a change in accounting principle no later than the second quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of sab will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the emerging issues task force issued no 
eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
eitf states that all costs relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to development of initial graphics and web page design should be accounted for using statement of position sop under this sop  costs incurred in the preliminary project stage should be expensed as incurred  as should most training and data conversion costs 
external direct costs of materials and services and internal direct payroll related costs should be capitalized once certain criteria are met 
eitf is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  we do not expect a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows on the eitf s effective date 
in march  the emerging issues task force issued no 
eitf  application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  which discusses the effect on revenue recognition of a software vendor s obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer 
the eitf has reached the conclusion that  if the customer is unable to utilize the software on the customer s hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software  then the arrangement with the customer is outside the scope of sop and should be treated as a service contract 
we may be required to change the timing of our revenue recognition related to product revenues 
we believe the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  we are determining the effect of sfas on our financial statements

sop requires that consulting  hardware  software and direct payroll related costs associated with the implementation of customized internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
these costs relate to game site application and infrastructure design and development  as well as costs related to providing customer account management and building in e commerce functionality and interfaces 
sop is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  as of march   we have capitalized  of these costs associated with the effort to build and support the ea 
com game sites at launch 
year readiness disclosure year status as of the date of this filing  we have not incurred any significant business disruptions as a result of year issues 
however  while no such occurrence has developed  year issues that may arise related to key suppliers and service providers may not become apparent immediately 
we have received assurances of year compliance from key suppliers 
we have also received assurances from key service providers such as financial institutions  our payroll service provider  and our retirement plan administrator as to their year readiness 
we will continue to monitor our own systems and our business partners to identify and address any potential risk situations related to the year we can provide no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by these suppliers and service providers due to noncompliance in the future 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies the legacy currency and the one common legal currency known as the euro 
from january  through june  the countries will be able to use their legacy currencies or the euro to transact business 
by july   at the latest  the conversion to the euro will be complete at which time the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
the fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies have eliminated exchange rate risk among the member countries 
the conversion to the euro has reduced the number of forward contracts that we use to hedge the exchange rate risk 
the forward contracts that were used to hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single euro hedge contract and the intercompany transactions among subsidiaries within the european union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk 
we do not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on our financial information systems which currently accommodate multiple currencies 
computer software changes necessary to comply with the year issue are generally compliant to the euro conversion issue 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that the euro conversion issue will have on our pricing or market strategies  and the impact  if any  it will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors electronic arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows risk factors relating to our core business platform transitions such as the one now occurring typically depress the market for video game software until new platforms achieve a wide market acceptance when new video game platforms are announced or introduced into the market  consumers typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms in anticipation of new platforms being available 
during that period sales of our video game products can be expected to slow or even decline until new platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance 
we are currently in such a transition 
sony expects to ship its playstation product in the fall of nintendo and microsoft have also announced that their new console systems will be released in calendar year current sales of our products for the existing playstation and nintendo platforms have been adversely affected 
we expect this trend to continue until one or more of these new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers 
new video game platforms create additional technical and business model uncertainties large portions of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms such as the sony playstation and nintendo the success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful 
sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected 
conversely  if we do not develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinue development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  the sega dreamcast console launched in japan in early and in the united states in september of we have no products under development for this platform 
should this platform achieve wide market acceptance  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
similarly  we intend to launch a variety of products for the new sony platform  the playstation  expected to be released in the united states in the fall of should that platform not achieve wide acceptance by consumers  we will have spent a disproportionate amount of our resources for this platform 
additionally  we have not negotiated publishing agreements with sony  sega or nintendo for their next generation platforms  and we do not know whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable 
product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia personal computers  or pcs  are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
for example  tiberian sun  which was expected to ship in fiscal at the time of our acquisition of westwood studios  was not released until the second quarter of fiscal due to development delays 
additionally  development risks for cd rom products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year 
our business is both seasonal and cyclical our business is seasonal with a significant percentage of our revenues occurring in the december quarter 
our business is also cyclical  video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  and decline as more advanced platforms are being introduced 
as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging  buying patterns may change 
purchases of products for older platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new platforms 
we are currently beginning such a platform transition 
sega introduced its latest platform in the united states in september  and sony expects to ship its playstation product in the fall of nintendo and microsoft have also announced that their new console systems will be released in calendar year sales of our current products for the current nintendo and sony platforms have already been adversely affected  and we expect this trend to continue until one or more new platforms achieves a wide installed base of consumers 
the impact of e commerce and online games on our business is not known while we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of our packaged products  we believe that such form of distribution will become a more significant factor in our business in the future 
e commerce is becoming an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers 
how that form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution  at which we have historically had success  and over what time period  is uncertain 
in addition  we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and become a significant factor in the interactive games business generally 
we do not know how that increase generally  or the emerging business of ea 
com specifically  will affect the sales of packaged goods 
our business  our products  and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy rules in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory while of course the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  in response to recent events  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products our agreements with hardware licensors  which are also our chief competitors  typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
for example  in prior years  we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors 
such occurrences would harm our business and adversely affect our financial performance 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to our business many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  many less recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
for example  we currently have a lawsuit pending regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others over the internet in which the patent holder has moved to enjoin the sale of ea personal computer products that can be played alone and over the internet 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
risk factors relating to our online business because of ea 
com s limited operating history  it will be difficult to evaluate its business and prospects ea 
com s business is still in the developing stages  so evaluating its business and prospects will be more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business 
we will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced in launching a new business  and we may not achieve our goals or may be compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the business 
these uncertainties as to the future operations of ea 
com will increase the difficulty we face in completing and pursuing the essential plans for the development of the business and will also make it more difficult for our stockholders and securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business 
ea 
com has a history of losses and expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability ea 
com has incurred substantial losses to date  including the current fiscal year 
we expect ea 
com to continue to incur losses as it develops its business 
ea 
com will be required to maintain the significant support  service and product enhancement demands of online users  and we cannot be certain that ea 
com will produce sufficient revenues from its operations to support these costs 
even if profitability is achieved  ea 
com may not be able to sustain it over a period of time 
our agreements with america online may not prove successful to the development of ea 
com s business we have announced a series of agreements with america online for the offering of our games through aol for online play 
these agreements require that we make substantial guaranteed payments to aol and that we commit our resources to pursuit of the online game opportunity 
we cannot be assured that the substantial costs associated with the aol agreements will be justified by the revenues generated from that relationship 
in addition  restrictions included in the aol agreements limiting other channels we may develop for offering online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies 
further  we are required under our agreement with aol to launch our game site within a specified time period or be subject to certain penalties  including aol s right to terminate the agreement 
we were not successful in meeting a june  initial launch target and we may not be successful in achieving other specified launch targets 
see additional discussion relating to our agreements with aol in note of the notes to consiolidated financial statements  included in item hereof 
the success for us of the aol agreements will also be a result of aol s performance under the agreements  a factor over which we will have very little control 
we have very limited experience with online games and may not be able to operate this business effectively offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games 
we anticipate employing various pricing models  including subscription fees  pay to play fees and advertising 
we have very little experience with developing optimal pricing strategies for online games and no experience in pay to play pricing or in securing advertising revenue for online services 
similarly  we are inexperienced in predicting usage patterns for our games 
because of our inexperience in this area  we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online 
online games have risks that are not associated with our traditional business online games  particularly multiplayer games  pose risks to player enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales 
players frequently would not be acquainted with other players  which may adversely affect the playing experiencing 
social issues raised by a player s conduct may impact the experience for other players 
we have not determined whether or how we might monitor or proctor player behavior to mitigate behavior that impairs the game experience 
in addition  there are substantial technical challenges to be met both in the introduction of our games online and in maintaining an effective game playing environment over time 
if these risks are not successfully controlled and technical challenges resolved  potential customers for our games may be unwilling to play in sufficient volume to allow us to attain or sustain profitability 
we may not be able to obtain the required licenses to offer our games online if we are unable to reach terms with certain licensors for our games  we will not be able to offer certain of our games for online play 
many of electronic arts most popular games feature characters  trademarks  people or concepts for which we have licenses from third parties 
as an example  our ea sports products typically contain content licensed from a sports and players association 
in certain instances the terms of these licenses will not allow us to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license 
we cannot be certain that the licensors will be amenable to a license for online games involving their content or  even if they are  that we will be able to reach terms with them for such use 
we may be forced to agree to terms that ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to the business of ea 
com 
many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used internet technologies 
additionally  many less recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of older technologies 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
for example  we currently have a lawsuit pending regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others over the internet in which the patent holder has moved to enjoin the sale of ea personal computer products that can be played alone and over the internet 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
development of ea 
com s business will require significant capital  and we cannot be assured that it will be available ea 
com will not be successful if it does not receive the very substantial financing that will be required to launch its business 
electronic arts has agreed to provide a limited amount of funding to ea 
com  but this financing alone will not be sufficient for the development of ea 
com s business 
any additional funding that is obtained from ea may either be treated as a revolving credit advance or would increase ea s retained interest in ea 
com and correspondingly decrease the interest of the holders of outstanding shares of class b common stock 
the attraction of additional equity or debt financing for ea 
com from third parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant dilution to class a and class b common stockholders or interest or other costs and debt related restrictions on the operation of the business 
if use of the internet does not continue to develop and reliably support the demands placed on it by electronic commerce  ea 
com s business will be harmed ea 
com s success depends upon growth in the use of the internet as a medium for playing games 
although the internet is experiencing rapid growth in the number of users  this growth is a recent phenomenon and may not continue 
furthermore  despite this growth in usage  the use of the internet for sophisticated games like ours is relatively new 
our business would be seriously harmed if o use of the internet does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  o the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support online game play  o concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions  or o government regulations regarding internet content  privacy or other conditions impede the effectiveness of the internet to users 
capacity restraints may restrict the use of the internet as a forum for game play  resulting in decreased demand for our products the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data 
other risks associated with commercial use of the internet could slow its growth  including o outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of the network infrastructure  o slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products  and o limited availability of cost effective  high speed access 
delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased governmental regulation  would cause the internet to fail to gain  or lose  viability as a means of game playing 
if these or any other factors cause use of the internet for commerce to slow or decline  the internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace 
this  in turn  would result in decreased demand for ea 
com s products and services 
to become and remain competitive  ea 
com must continually develop and expand new content 
this is inherently risky and expensive 
ea 
com s success depends on our ability to develop products and services for the initial launch of the ea 
com site and our ability to continually expand the content on that site 
our agreement with aol requires us to develop new games under our relationship with aol 
we cannot assure you that products will be developed on time  in a cost effective manner  or that they will be successful 
we may not be able to respond to rapid technological change 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
both in completing the design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter  we will be required to continually improve performance  features  reliability and capacity of our network infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding rapidly or in a cost effective manner to such developments 
increasing governmental regulation of the internet could limit the market for our products as internet commerce continues to evolve  we expect that federal  state and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
it is possible that legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability  taxation or other increased costs  any of which could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for ea 
com s products 
if we do not maintain our relationship with outside consultants such as andersen consulting and proxicom  our ability to develop our online business will be impaired because approximately of the staff creating  designing  and developing the infrastructure for ea 
com s website and network interface is being provided by outside consultants such as andersen consulting and proxicom  losing the business relationship with such consultants would cause ea 
com to lose an important component of its website implementation team 
given the intense competition for qualified technical consultants  ea 
com may not be able to retain these consultants or  if necessary  replace them 
if it cannot do so  its ability to develop its business will be impaired 
our revenues have been heavily dependent on a single product and would be adversely affected if that product s popularity were to decline ea 
com s revenues to date have consisted primarily of revenues from sales of our online product ultima online  and we would be adversely affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason and not be replaced 
we expect the online game market to become increasingly competitive  and it is possible that other producer s current or future games could cause our revenue from ultima online to decline 
in addition  popularity of ultima online could decline over time simply because of consumer preference for new game experiences 
we invest very heavily in research and development and network development and support for ea 
com  and we cannot be assured that we will achieve revenues that validate this level of spending we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  very heavily in research and development and network development and support for our website and online games 
we will need to expand ea 
com s revenues substantially for it to achieve profitability with these levels of expenditure being required  and we may not be able to do so 
if we cannot increase revenues to profitable levels  the value of ea 
com will be impaired 
in order to develop the broad games offerings that we envision for our online operations it will be necessary to engage in significant developmental efforts both to adapt existing ea games to the online format and to create new online games 
our agreements with aol require us to maintain a substantial commitment to online game development and we cannot be assured that we will realize acceptable returns from this investment 
online product development schedules are unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult online product development schedules  particularly for internet based games are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools  internet latency issues  a learning process to better understand internet based game mechanics  and research and experimentation associated with development for new online technologies 
additionally  development risks for internet based products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because of the challenges associated with game testing  live beta testing  integration into network servers and integration on to the games web site and impact the release  go live dates of products during a particular quarter 
our revenues and operating costs are dependent on our ability to meet our product go live schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues falling short of analysts expectations  with no corresponding decrease in expenses  resulting in increased operating losses for ea 
com general risk factors we face intense competition for talent from highly valued internet companies competition for employees in the interactive software business continues to be intense 
recently  the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key employees is from internet companies 
the large equity positions frequently offered to key executives and creative talent in such companies and the actual or perceived opportunity for rapid stock price appreciation of these companies make their compensation packages attractive to those who are already working in more mature companies 
this situation creates difficulty for us to compete for the attraction and retention of executive and key creative talent 
because of the intense competition for qualified technical  creative  marketing and other personnel  we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our businesses the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development of online businesses and management of our online and core businesses is extremely competitive  and we may not be able to attract and retain the employees we need 
in addition  the rising cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area the location of our headquarters and largest studio  has increased dramatically  and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations for fiscal international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
for example  our european revenues in fiscal were adversely impacted by a devaluation of the euro as compared to the prior year 
our foreign currency exposure may increase if this trend continues 
any of these factors may significantly harm our business 
increased difficulties in forecasting results during platform transition periods  where the success of our products is significantly impacted by the changing market for our products  forecasting our revenues and earnings is more difficult than in more stable or rising product markets 
the demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than we anticipate  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings 
fluctuations in stock price due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics businesses or the securities markets in general 
for example  during fiscal year  the price per share of our common stock ranged from to 
because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies  thereby  limiting our risk 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately  in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  european currency units euro  canadian dollars  japanese yen and other currencies 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value

the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
we also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity 
at march   our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments included debt securities of  notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations
