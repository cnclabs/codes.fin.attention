ffo funds from operations the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit in march which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated real estate affiliates 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
in addition  ffo as computed by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled figures reported by other reits 
the company believes that ffo is an effective measure of the company s operating performance because analysts and investors usually use ffo in analyzing the operating results of real estate companies rather than using earnings per share 
the following is a summary of the company s ffo and a reconciliation of net income to ffo for the periods presented for the years ended december  in thousands funds from operations    increase in funds from operations from prior period reconciliation net income    income allocable to investor unit rights  gain on sale of investments   depreciation and amortization deferred financing leases    consolidated properties    unconsolidated real estate affiliates    minority interest portion    funds from operations    ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the company believes that there are several important factors that contribute to the ability of the company to increase rent and improve profitability of its shopping centers  including aggregate retailer sales volume  sales per square foot  occupancy levels and retailer costs 
each of these factors has a significant effect on ebitda 
the company believes that ebitda is an effective measure of operating performance because ebitda is unaffected by the debt and equity structure of the property owner 
ebitda i does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s overall performance  iii is not indicative of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities determined in accordance with gaap  and iv is not an alternative to cash flows determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity 
the company s ebitda after minority interest plus its pro rata share of ebitda of unconsolidated real estate affiliates increased from million in to million in the growth in ebitda reflects the addition of total gla  increased rental rates  increased retailer sales  improved occupancy levels and effective control of operating costs

the interest rate on the fixed rate debt ranges from to 
the company s pro rata share of debt to total market capitalization  based on the common stock share price at december  was  excluding the capital notes from the numerator 
the maturity dates of consolidated indebtedness range from to scheduled principal amortization and balloon payments in connection with maturing mortgage indebtedness over the next five years and thereafter are set forth in the table below amount year in thousands thereafter  the company believes that redevelopment  repositioning and expansion are key to maximizing the use and performance of its assets and increasing its income growth and capital appreciation 
the company continually evaluates the redevelopment potential of its properties  including properties that have undergone redevelopment in the past five years 
due to the financial and regulatory burdens presented by the development of new regional shopping centers  the company believes that an on going redevelopment program provides a cost efficient means of ensuring that the company s existing centers compete effectively within their existing markets and are able to attract new customers 
capital expenditures and capitalized leasing costs totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table shows the components of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing costs 
for the years ended december  in millions renovations and expansions tenant allowances capitalized leasing costs other capital expenditures total capital expenditures were financed by external funding and recovery of costs from retailers where applicable 
the company is currently involved in several development projects and had outstanding commitments totaling approximately million as of december   which will be funded through existing mortgage debt  new mortgage debt and the secured line of credit 
the historical sources of capital used to fund the company s operating expenses  interest expense  recurring capital expenditures and non recurring capital expenditures such as major building renovations and expansions have been i ffo  ii the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and iii the issuance of equity 
the company anticipates that development projects  expansion projects and potential acquisitions will be funded by external financing sources 
the company anticipates that its ffo will provide the necessary funds on a short term and long term basis for its operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness and all distributions to the shareholders in accordance with reit requirements 
sources for recurring and non recurring capital expenditures on a short term and long term basis  such as major building renovations and expansions  as well as for scheduled principal payments  including balloon payments on outstanding indebtedness are expected to be obtained from i additional debt financing  ii additional equity and iii working capital reserves 
although no assurance can be given  the company believes that it will have access to capital resources sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements and expand and develop its business in accordance with its strategy for growth 
distributions a distribution was declared on december  to shareholders of record on december  of million including per common share for the quarter ended december   which is equal to per common share on an annualized basis 
the company intends to pay regular quarterly distributions to holders of its preferred and common stock 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of the properties 
nonetheless  substantially all of the retailers leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact to the company 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on retailer s gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  contractual rent steps which increase rental rates during the term of the lease  or both 
in addition  the remaining terms of the existing leases are for an average period of less than ten years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher effective rentals if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  except for most anchor leases  require the retailers to pay a proportionate share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may however  have a negative effect on some of the company s other operating items 
interest and general and administrative expense may be adversely affected by inflation as these costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
the company enters into interest rate swap contracts as a means of reducing its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
also  for leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect because the rent increases specified in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time 
impact of year the company and its affiliates use the manager s information systems 
as of march   the manager s hardware and software applications experienced no significant disruptions due to what is commonly referred to as the yk issue which includes reference to the fact that certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company and its affiliates exchange electronic data with certain outside vendors in the banking and payroll processing areas 
the manager has been advised by these vendors that their systems are year compliant and as of march  has experienced no significant disruptions in the systems 
the manager is not aware of any other vendors  suppliers  or external agents with a yk issue that would materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the manager has no means of ensuring that external agents are year compliant  and there can be no assurance that the manager has identified all such external agents 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer hardware and software applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
