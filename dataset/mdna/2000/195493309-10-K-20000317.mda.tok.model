item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented on the following pages 
the principal purpose of this review is to provide the reader of the attached financial statements and accompanying footnotes with a detailed analysis of the financial results of the colonial bancgroup  inc and subsidiaries for the purposes of this item  bancgroup or the company 
among other things  this discussion provides commentary on bancgroup s history  operating philosophies  the components of net interest margin and balance sheet strength as measured by the quality of assets  the composition of the loan portfolio and capital adequacy 
strategy bancgroup was reorganized in as a holding company with one bank and million in assets 
through business combinations and strong internal growth  bancgroup has grown to a billion multi state bank holding company whose bank subsidiary operates full service branches through operating regions in six states 
these operating regions are sometimes referred to in this discussion as regional banks 
the foundation of bancgroup is built upon a community banking philosophy that allows local autonomy in lending decisions and customer relationships 
this operating philosophy has been important in making acquisitions  retaining skilled and highly motivated local management teams and developing a strong customer base  particularly with respect to lending relationships 
bancgroup s performance goals are to maintain double digit earnings growth with above average asset quality  a return on equity  a return on assets and a consistently increasing dividend 
the strategies employed to achieve these results are outlined below 
they represent the foundation upon which bancgroup operates and the basis for achieving the company s goals 
emphasis on growth from through  bancgroup completed acquisitions establishing operations in some of the highest growth markets in the country such as atlanta  orlando  miami  southwest florida  dallas and las vegas 
through the success of the company s strategies of acquisitions and growth in these markets  the geographic composition of bancgroup s loans and deposits has significantly changed 
this shift in concentration positions the company in the markets necessary to continue its successful earnings growth trends 
the following table illustrates the change in bancgroup s regional bank concentration of loans and deposits years prior to are as originally reported  prior to restatements for poolings of interest 
to total at december  loans alabama florida georgia other deposits alabama florida georgia other loan and deposit growth is emphasized in each market area through the company s regional banks 
bancgroup has been successful in competing for loans against larger financial institutions  due primarily to the company s local lending strategy which includes direct involvement by local management and directors 
internal loan growth of in and a net charge off ratio of evidence the success of the local market lending strategy 
the regional banks have additional growth opportunities through the development of customer relationships by cross selling a variety of bank products and services 
strong regional bank management supported by bancgroup s asset liability and products and services management teams provide the company with the resources to remain competitive in its deposit markets 
through these groups efforts  the company has established a strategy to grow and retain its deposit base while remaining competitive in deposit pricing and meeting the company s funding and liquidity goals 
deposit growth is one of the company s primary objectives for management has established several initiatives to accomplish this goal 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed several campaigns to expand its deposit base in the lower cost florida markets 
these campaigns resulted in average deposit growth for the quarter in addition to the achieved in the first nine months of the year in florida 
in january  the company established a branch incentive program in which one of the key goals is for employees to achieve an established deposit growth rate in their branches 
management has contracted with a database marketing consultant to target specific products and markets for future deposit campaigns in order to more cost effectively increase its deposit base 
each of these initiatives is designed to provide a solid foundation for achieving the company s deposit growth objectives 
emphasis on sales and service the company is comprised of approximately full service branches in regions and six states 
due to this significant presence in key areas  management has established initiatives to utilize this retail base to grow deposits as previously discussed and to expand its noninterest income producing revenue sources 
the branch incentive program mentioned earlier is considered an integral part of transforming our branch teams into an effective sales force 
personnel will receive compensation for achieving established quarterly goals 
these goals include retail deposit growth  noninterest income growth  operating efficiency targets and customer service targets 
customer needs are constantly changing  and bancgroup continues to investigate methods of improving customer service through new services  product enhancements and technological advances 
over the past two years  the company has created or expanded various services that should expand its sources of noninterest income and provide better customer service 
these services include international banking  private banking  investment sales and asset management 
as part of the company s continuing efforts to cross sell these services through its retail network  an increased training effort was initiated with branch personnel to further their understanding of these services and the alternatives they provide to their customers 
an incentive for referrals of customers to these areas has been established for company employees 
by linking each of these initiatives to employee compensation  management expects deposit growth and noninterest income growth to continue to improve 
emphasis on operational efficiencies in  management began implementing its plans to de emphasize bank acquisitions and to focus on streamlining operations and completing system conversions of acquired banks 
these actions alleviated any further conversion delays and the resulting delay in cost savings 
the company completed seven conversions in and completed the conversion of its texas branches in the first quarter of the remaining conversions in nevada should be completed by the end of april these conversions allow the branches to process customer and account data on the same operating system  which enhances their product offering capability and provides additional customer services while allowing for consolidation of back office operations 
the success of these efforts to streamline operations is most noticeable in the reduction of noninterest expense to average assets excluding mortgage banking assets to in compared to in on the same basis  the efficiency ratio improved to in compared to in management began additional initiatives in mid some of these initiatives were the further consolidation of loan operations  the establishment of a central company wide help desk to provide branch operational support  the establishment of a call center to provide more efficient customer service and a lock box service for more efficient processing of loan payments 
the company has invested in technology that will provide additional efficiencies to its processing of construction loans  small business loans and customer wire transactions 
in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented the first phase of a corporate wide imaging system 
by imaging its internal reports and documents  the company expects to reduce document storage  paper and courier costs and provide information more efficiently to users 
management continually monitors its back office areas for new and improved methods of more efficiently handling its operational functions  providing better support to its regional banks and improving customer service 
emphasis on profitability in  the company completed its restructuring plans to sell five supermarket branches  to close several unprofitable branches and relocate and upgrade several branches 
in the third quarter of  the company completed the sale of its dalton  georgia branches and made several strategic decisions regarding colonial bank s subsidiary  colonial mortgage company 
the company completed the sale of colonial mortgage s wholesale mortgage production unit on october  the retail mortgage production offices were merged into the regional bank management structure to increase the company s focus on providing a broad range of mortgage products and services to retail bank customers 
on december   colonial mortgage was merged into colonial bank 
this merger is expected to allow for the streamlining of the operational functions while preserving each regional bank s ability to offer mortgage banking products to its customers 
as of december  colonial bank was servicing approximately billion in mortgage loans for third parties 
the company plans to reduce the emphasis on the mortgage servicing line of business and sell portions of this portfolio 
the company has initiated a strategy to provide a more accurate method of assessing customer profitability 
this new source of customer relationship information will allow more targeted promotions to address specific customers needs 
with enhanced customer information in the hands of retail branch personnel and other areas that offer customer products  the company hopes to give more efficient and effective customer service 
by providing more targeted customer services  management expect service delivery to be more cost effective resulting in improved customer profitability 
emphasis on asset quality maintaining high asset quality is at the forefront of the company s strategy to allow for consistent earnings growth 
bancgroup s asset quality is demonstrated by its charge off history and nonperforming asset levels  which compare favorably to its peer group 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate was reduced to at december   its lowest year end level in six years  primarily through the sales of other real estate and a lower percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans 
net charge offs over the past six years have consistently compared favorably with national averages and were only of average loans in and in the company cannot guarantee its success in implementing the initiatives or reaching the goals outlined in this discussion 
the following analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides details with respect to this summary material and identifies trends concerning the initiatives taken in business combinations a principal part of bancgroup s growth strategy has been to merge other financial institutions into bancgroup in order to increase the company s market share in existing markets  expand into other growth markets  more efficiently absorb the company s overhead and add profitable new lines of business 
bancgroup has completed the following business combinations with other financial institutions 
these business combinations have been reflected in the financial statements at december  the balances reflected below are as of the date of consummation

accordingly  all financial statement amounts have been restated to reflect the financial condition and results of operations as if the combinations had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
the combinations with tomoka  great southern and first independence and the combination with cnb holding were accounted for using the pooling of interests method  however  due to immateriality  the prior year financial statements were not restated 
the remaining business combinations were accounted for as purchases  and the operations and income of the combined institutions are included in the income of bancgroup from the date of purchase 
the shares issued for both the combination with first commerce banks of florida  inc and the combination with tb t  inc 
included shares previously re purchased by the company as treasury shares 
each of the combined institutions that were accounted for as purchases was merged into bancgroup or one of its subsidiaries as of the listed dates  and the income and expenses have not been separately accounted for since the respective mergers 
for this reason and due to the fact that significant changes have been made to the cost structure of each combined institution  a separate determination of the impact after combination on the earnings of bancgroup for and cannot reasonably be determined

levels of interest rates net interest margin was for compared to for the primary factor affecting this decline in net interest margin was that  in spite of rising rates in the last half of  the average prime rate for was compared to the average for of 
likewise  the average targeted fed funds rate for overnight borrowing decreased from for to in as a result of these lower average rates  the company s yield on earning assets decreased to from in and in interest bearing liabilities do not re price as quickly as earning assets due to the competition for certain types of deposits 
the yield on interest bearing liabilities declined to for  from for both and primarily due to lower average market rates than prior years

as a result of decreased activity due to the sale and increasing mortgage rates  average mortgage loans held for sale decreased to million in from million in at december   mortgage loans held for sale had declined to million 
also as a result of the sale of the wholesale production unit  the company has entered into a third party correspondent relationship for the sale of its retail production of fixed rate mortgage loans  which substantially eliminates the need to hedge interest rate risk associated with new production

the residential real estate loans are predominantly adjustable rate first mortgages that have a low level of credit risk and accordingly have lower yields than other types of loans

interest bearing liabilities cost of funds the average cost of funds decreased to in  compared to in and the lower average cost of funds is primarily the result of the previously discussed decline in interest rates that began september and continued into the second quarter competitive pressures on new time deposits and variable interest deposits remained strong 
due to these pressures  the company s funding mix has shifted to a higher concentration of borrowings  primarily through credit facilities with the federal home loan bank 
the percentage of average total borrowings to total funding sources is for compared to for and for these borrowings are an excellent funding source since they are at rates lower than or comparable to what the market demands for new time deposit funds 
in addition to these sources  the company has initiated strategies to increase deposits through its retail branch network 
as discussed under liquidity and interest sensitivity  bancgroup s management considers these sources of funds to be adequate to fund future loan growth 
noninterest income one of bancgroup s primary strategies has been to expand its sources of noninterest income 
the company continues to emphasize growth in international banking  asset management services and electronic banking services 
these services provide a broader base of revenue generation capabilities 
noninterest income increased million or from to and million or from to increase decrease years ended december  compared compared to to in thousands noninterest income mortgage servicing fees      service charges on deposit accounts      other charges  fees  and commissions    other income      subtotal      other noninterest income items securities gains  net  gain loss on disposal of other real estate and repossessions   total noninterest income      noninterest income from deposit accounts is significantly affected by competitive pricing on these services and the volume of noninterest bearing accounts

this increase in volume  increases in service fee rates and acquisitions resulted in a increase in service charge income in and a increase in in  the increases in service charges and fees were partially offset by the sale and closure of certain branches 
other charges  fees  and commissions increased  or in and  or in the increase is primarily from credit card related fees and official check commissions

in october  the company sold its wholesale mortgage production unit 
the retail production offices were merged into the regional bank structure to increase the company s focus on providing a broad range of mortgage products and services to retail bank customers 
as a result of this sale and increasing interest rates  previously discussed  gains on the sales of loans decreased million in to million 
low mortgage interest rates in resulted in an increase in new home sales and refinancings 
due to this increased activity  gains on the sales of loans increased million in to million from million in these fluctuations are reflected in other income in the accompanying table

noninterest expense noninterest expense to average assets improved to from and in and  respectively 
these ratios are stated on a comparable basis excluding acquisition and restructuring costs  yk expenses and the additional write down of mortgage servicing rights 
during the fourth quarter of  management made the decision to shift the company s focus from bank acquisitions to streamlining operations and completing systems conversions of acquired banks 
the foundation for these efficiencies is the current operating structure where the regional banks are supported by centralized back office operations 
the company completed the conversion of its remaining georgia and florida acquired banks in the company completed the conversion of banks acquired in texas in the first quarter of conversions of banks acquired in nevada are scheduled for completion in february and april  respectively 
the company completed the sale of five supermarket branches in the first quarter of  closed several unprofitable branches in the second quarter of  completed the sale of its dalton  georgia branches in the third quarter of and sold the wholesale mortgage production unit in the fourth quarter of as a result of the sale of the wholesale mortgage production unit  the retail offices were merged into the regional bank structure of colonial bank 
in order to further streamline the mortgage banking operations  its other units such as servicing  accounting and secondary marketing were merged into the corresponding commercial banking areas such as operations  accounting and treasury 
each of these initiatives resulted in a reduction in operating expenses after its completion  although the full impact will not be reflected until increase decrease years ended december  compared compared to to in thousands noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits     occupancy expense  net      furniture and equipment expenses      amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights      amortization of intangible assets     acquisition and restructuring expense      yk expense    fdic and state assessments    advertising and public relations    stationery  printing and supplies     telephone     legal fees     postage and courier     insurance    professional services      travel    other      total noninterest expense      noninterest expense  excluding acquisition  restructuring and yk expenses to average assets salaries and benefits increased by  in and million or in the increase in is due to normal salary rate increases offset by a reduction in personnel resulting from the branch sales and closings discussed above 
the increase in is primarily due to salary rate increases and increased staffing levels as a result of acquisitions 
as discussed in note to bancgroup s consolidated financial statements  bancgroup defers certain salary and benefit costs associated with loan originations and amortizes these costs as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 
the amount of costs deferred remained relatively constant from to net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increases are primarily due to improvements to the company s computer and communications technology 
these improvements in technology give the company the ability to enhance customer service and continue to improve back office efficiencies 
these increases were offset by reductions in costs related to the previously detailed sales of certain branches 
there were also increased occupancy costs in related to improved technology  the relocation of certain facilities and acquisition activities 
these relocations should allow for expansion of the company s customer base and provide better customer service 
in the mortgage banking division recorded million in additional write downs to its mortgage servicing rights msr 
this write down was caused primarily by anticipated prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio being greater than previously expected 
the remaining million of msr amortization in and million of msr amortization in are normal amortization resulting from the growth in the servicing portfolio and higher estimates of mortgage prepayments 
results for also includes million in expense related to the msr hedging instruments 
the net balance of msrs was million and million at december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets primarily increased due to the acquisitions in of asb bancshares  inc and tb t  inc 
and in of shamrock holdings  inc  first commerce bank of florida  inc 
and dadeland bancshares  inc  which were accounted for as purchases and therefore required the recording of goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
a waiver of the state assessment in the first and second quarters of caused the decrease in the fdic and state assessments in of  fluctuations in advertising  supplies  postage and other expenses are primarily due to normal operating activities and acquisition related activities offset by lower operating expenses resulting from the sale and closure of certain branches 
acquisition expense and restructuring charges in the first quarter of  bancgroup reorganized executive management of its florida regions  which resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company developed a plan to close certain unprofitable branches sell five supermarket branches relocate and upgrade two other branches move the headquarters of the south florida region to downtown miami and to consolidate the trust department into the south florida headquarters to better serve its customer base 
as a result of these actions  bancgroup recognized restructuring charges of million  which were net of  in reversals of unused reserves 
at each balance sheet date  company management reviews payments and other activity relating to the liability balances to ensure the amounts have been properly applied to the accruals 
additionally  company management reviews the status of the restructuring plan to ensure that there has not been a significant change which affects the accruals ie delay in subleasing due to changes in the market conditions or settlement of liability for an amount different from the amount accrued 
this evaluation includes obtaining updates  as needed  from third party experts  such as leasing agents

management in south florida continues to pursue a resolution of the space vacated from the relocation of its headquarters and trust department 
management is in negotiations with its lessor regarding the lease terms as well as pursuing the possibility of subleasing the space 
management does not have a specific date of completion at this time 
the results for  reflect the continued implementation of the company s plan to de emphasize acquisitions  complete system conversions  streamline operations and eliminate less profitable operations 
as a result of this focus  the company recognized acquisition and conversion related expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses related primarily to transaction costs such as legal and accounting fees and incremental charges related to the integration of acquired banks  such as system conversion including contract buy outs and write offs of equipment and employee severance 
year readiness disclosure until recently  many computer software programs and processing systems  including some of those used by bancgroup and its subsidiaries in their operations  were not designed to accommodate entries beyond the year in date fields 
failure to address the anticipated consequences of this design deficiency could have had material adverse effects on the business and operations of any business  including bancgroup  that relies on computers and associated technologies 
bancgroup aggressively addressed the challenges that year presented to its operations 
the transition into year went according to plan with all functions doing business as usual

the company has hedged approximately of its mortgage servicing rights asset at december  issuance of million subordinated notes which qualifies as tier ii capital 
these items  as well as a more detailed analysis of bancgroup s financial condition  are discussed in the following sections 
loans growth in loans and maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio are the principal ingredients for improved earnings 
management s emphasis  within all of bancgroup s banking regions  is on loan growth in accordance with local market demands and using the lending experience and expertise in the regional banks 
management believes that its strategy of meeting local demands and utilizing local lending expertise has proved successful 
this success is evident in internal loan growth of in  in  in and in  excluding acquisitions 
internal loan growth has been a major factor in bancgroup s increasing earnings 
management believes that any existing concentrations of loans  whether geographically  by industry  or by borrower  do not expose bancgroup to unacceptable levels of risk 
the current concentration of loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
these differences  in addition to quality underwriting  serve to reduce the risk of losses 
bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans representing of total loans 
bancgroup s commercial real estate loans are spread geographically throughout alabama and florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas and reno and las vegas  nevada with no more than of these loans in any one geographic region 
the alabama economy experiences a generally slow but steady rate of growth  while georgia  florida  texas and nevada are experiencing higher rates of growth with the las vegas metropolitan area experiencing significant growth 
real estate in bancgroup s lending areas has not experienced significantly inflated values due to excessive speculation or inflationary pressures 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate portfolio consists of various property types with no one property type constituting a concentration 
risk is further reduced by the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines 
bancgroup s commercial real estate related loans continue to perform at acceptable levels 
bancgroup also continues to have a significant concentration of residential real estate loans as they represent of total loans 
substantially all of these loans are adjustable rate first mortgages on single family  owner occupied properties  and therefore  have minimal credit risk and lower interest rate sensitivity 
a portion of these loans was acquired through bank acquisitions 
bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
bancgroup s international banking department became fully operational in july the department engages in confirming letters of credit  primarily with top tier banks in latin america  and direct disbursements to those banks from us customers 
loans outstanding to latin american banks at december totaled approximately million 
however  due to the immaterial balance of these loans in relation to total loans  these amounts will not be reported separately 
bancgroup established a mortgage warehouse lending department in the third quarter of this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to top tier mortgage companies predominantly in the southeast 
loans outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively  with unfunded commitments of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these loans are categorized as other loans in the following schedule 
the mortgage banking production unit holds mortgage loans on a short term basis generally less than ninety days while these loans are being packaged for sale 
these loans are classified as mortgage loans held for sale with balances totaling million  million and million  at december   and  respectively 
there is minimal credit risk associated with these loans 
the fluctuations in mortgage loans held for sale are directly related to the fluctuation in long term interest rates and its related impact on mortgage loan refinancing and new home sales 
the decrease in the balance is the result of rising mortgage rates and the october sale of the wholesale mortgage production unit 
the company continues to originate these loans through its retail mortgage branches 
these loans are funded principally with short term borrowings  providing a relatively high margin for these funds 
as discussed more fully in subsequent sections  management has established policies and procedures to ensure maintenance of adequate liquidity and liquidity sources 
bancgroup has arranged funding sources in addition to customer deposits that provide the capability for the company to exceed a loan to deposit ratio and maintain adequate liquidity

the goals of bancgroup with respect to loan maturities and rate sensitivity continue to focus on shorter term maturities and floating or adjustable rate loans 
at december   approximately of loans were floating rate loans 
contractual maturities may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan pay offs 
the uncertainties of future events  particularly with respect to interest rates  make it difficult to predict the actual maturities 
bancgroup has not maintained records related to trends of early pay off since management does not believe such trends would present any significantly more accurate estimate of actual maturities than the contractual maturities presented

       real estate residential        installment and consumer        other        loan quality a major key to long term earnings growth is maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio 
bancgroup s directive in this regard is carried out through its policies and procedures for the underwriting and ongoing review of loans and through a company wide senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continued basis 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the credit worthiness of the borrower  but generally require maximum loan to value ratios of for commercial real estate and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
based on the credit review process and loan grading system  bancgroup determines its allowance for possible loan losses and the amount of provision for loan losses 
the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb potential losses on loans present in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  the provision for possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance  and the allowance for loan losses of acquired banks 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the overall goal and result of these policies and procedures is to provide a sound basis for new credit extensions and an early recognition of problem assets to allow increased flexibility in their timely disposition 
loan loss experience during  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans decreased to from in and in as a result of the company s localized lending strategies and early identification of potential problem loans  bancgroup s net charge offs have been consistently low 
in addition  the current concentration of residential real estate loans has had a favorable impact on net charge offs 
the following schedule reflects greater than coverage of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated by the allowance for loan losses 
management has not targeted any specific coverage ratio in excess of  and the coverage ratio may fluctuate significantly as larger loans are placed into or removed from nonperforming status 
management s focus has been on establishing reserves related to an early identification of potential problem loans 
management is committed to maintaining adequate reserve levels to absorb losses present in the loan portfolio

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is also to charge off installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued      aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower      total nonperforming loans      other real estate and in substance foreclosure      repossessions total nonperforming assets      aggregate loans contractually past due days for which interest is being accrued      total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of total loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more which are still accruing interest 
fluctuations from year to year in the balances of nonperforming assets are attributable to several factors including changing economic conditions in various markets  nonperforming assets obtained in various acquisitions and the disproportionate impact of larger over  individual credits 
management  through its loan officers  internal loan review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of potential problem loans not included above 
the status of these loans is reviewed at least quarterly by loan officers and bancgroup credit administration and annually by bancgroup s centralized credit review function and by regulatory agencies 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment inadequate  the loans are reduced to estimated recoverable amounts through increases in reserves allocated to the loans or charge offs 
as of december   substantially all of these loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans as potential problem loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these potential problem loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
the above nonperforming loans and potential problem loans represent all material credits for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans was not significant for the years ended december     and the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
securities bancgroup determines on a daily basis the funds available for short term investment 
funds available for long term investment are projected based upon anticipated loan and deposit growth  liquidity needs  pledging requirements and maturities of securities  as well as other factors 
based on these factors and management s interest rate and income tax forecast  an investment strategy is determined 
significant elements of this strategy as of december  include bancgroup s investment in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies is substantially all pledged against public funds deposits or used as collateral for repurchase agreements 
bancgroup is required to carry federal home loan bank fhlb stock in connection with its borrowings with fhlb 
bancgroup is also required to carry federal reserve stock since its subsidiary bank became a member bank of the federal reserve system in june investment alternatives that maximize the after tax net yield are considered 
management has also attempted to increase the investment portfolio s overall yield by investing funds in excess of pledging requirements in high grade corporate notes and mortgage backed securities 
the maturities of investment alternatives are determined in consideration of the yield curve  liquidity needs and the company s asset liability gap position 
the risk elements associated with the various types of securities are also considered in determining investment strategies 
us treasury and non callable us government agency obligations are considered to contain virtually no default or prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities have varying degrees of risk of impairment of principal 
impairment risk is primarily associated with accelerated prepayments  particularly with respect to longer maturities purchased at a premium and interest only strip securities 
bancgroup s mortgage backed security portfolio as of december  does not include any interest only strip securities and the amount of unamortized premium on mortgage backed securities is approximately  the recoverability of bancgroup s investment in mortgage backed securities is reviewed periodically  and where necessary  appropriate adjustments are made to income for impaired values 
obligations of state and political subdivisions  as well as other securities  have varying degrees of credit risk associated with the individual borrowers 
the credit ratings and the credit worthiness of these securities are reviewed periodically and appropriate reserves are established when necessary 
investment securities are those securities which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
the decline in investment securities is due to maturities and calls in the portfolio 
securities available for sale represent those securities that bancgroup intends to hold for an indefinite period of time or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk and other similar factors 
these securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses  net of any tax effect  added or deducted from shareholders equity 
the balance in securities available for sale increased from billion at december  to billion at december  at december   bancgroup had million in mortgage backed securities purchased under a reverse repurchase agreement 
these securities are collateral for million in debt outstanding in connection with the purchase of these securities 
at december   there was no single issuer  with the exception of us government and us government agencies  where the aggregate book value of these securities exceeded of shareholders equity million 
the changes noted above are reflected on the following table

see contractual maturities in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this category excludes all corporate common and preferred stock since these instruments have no maturity date 
mortgage servicing rights and servicing hedge the balances of msr were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company  with the assistance of a third party advisor  developed a strategy to hedge against future decreases in interest rates 
in october  the company began to hedge a portion of its servicing portfolio and related msr asset 
at december  and  the company had hedged approximately and of the msr asset primarily through the use of floors and principal only strips in and treasury futures and options in the hedge positions are monitored daily and adjusted as necessary for changes in the market and projected interest rate movement 
the objective of this strategy is to achieve a high degree of correlation between changes in value associated with the hedged asset the servicing portfolio and the related servicing rights and the servicing hedge 
the servicing hedge is designed to rise in value when interest rates fall and decline in value when interest rates rise  in contrast to the expected movements in value of the servicing asset  therefore reducing earnings volatility caused by interest rate movements 
these risk management activities do not eliminate interest rate risk in the msr 
treasury rates  to which portions of the msr hedges are indexed  may not move in tandem with mortgage interest rates 
as mortgage interest rates change  actual prepayments may not respond exactly as anticipated 
other pricing factors  such as the volatility of the market yields  may affect the value of the hedges without similarly impacting the msr

deposits bancgroup s deposit structure consists of the following december  of total in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits   interest bearing demand deposits   savings deposits   certificates of deposits less than    certificates of deposits more than    ira s   open time deposits   total deposits   bancgroup  through its acquisitions and branch expansion programs  has increased its market presence into high growth markets in the country 
prior to  the expansion was concentrated in florida and the atlanta metropolitan area 
in  colonial continued its efforts by moving west into dallas  texas and reno and las vegas  nevada 
the principal goal is to provide the company s retail customer base with convenient access to branch locations while enhancing the company s potential for future increases in profitability 
deposits have increased million or in this increase includes of internal growth in savings and time deposits and increased wholesale funds offset by a decrease due to the sale of the dalton  georgia branches and five supermarket branches 
due to the nature of demand deposits  balances can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis  therefore  average balances are more representative of their impact on corporate funding 
although these deposits reflect a decrease of million at december   average demand deposits increased from to competition for deposits remains strong within the banking industry as well as increased competition from the other business sectors 
in the fourth quarter of  bancgroup initiated several campaigns to grow its deposit base 
the high growth areas of florida were a primary target due to the lower cost funds in that market 
these campaigns resulted in average deposit growth for the quarter  in addition to the achieved in the first nine months of the year in florida 
the growth of deposits continues to be a primary strategic initiative of the company 
in january  a branch incentive plan was implemented in which a key goal is for employees to obtain an established deposit growth rate in their branches 
management has contracted with a database marketing consultant to target specific products and markets for future deposit campaigns in order to more cost effectively grow deposits 
each of these initiatives should provide a solid foundation for achieving the company s deposit growth objectives 
the company has an established brokered certificate of deposit cd program to offer cd s in increments of  to  to out of market customers at competitive rates and maturities 
at december  and  million and million  respectively were outstanding under this program 
the company has a brokered money market program that attracts deposits from out of market customers 
at december  and  million and million were outstanding  respectively 
short term borrowings short term borrowings were comprised of the following at december   and in thousands fhlb borrowings    federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements    reverse repurchase agreements    current maturities fhlb advances    other short term borrowings   total    to assist in funding loan growth  bancgroup has credit facilities at the fhlb 
at december  and  bancgroup had borrowings of billion and billion outstanding of which million and million  respectively  note are included in long term debt with the remaining portion included in short term borrowings  leaving credit availability at december  of million based on current collateral 
this credit facility is collateralized by the company s residential real estate loans 
colonial bank has an additional million warehouse line with fhlb that is collateralized by mortgage loans held for sale with no balance outstanding at december  correspondent banks and customers provide a consistent base of short term funds with million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively  in fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
short term borrowings  including fhlb borrowings  have been used to fund short term assets  primarily mortgage loans held for sale and loans 
fhlb borrowings have been used during and to fund loan growth 
as discussed more fully in the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity section of this report  the line of credit with fhlb is considered a primary source of funding for the company s asset growth 
bancgroup entered into reverse repurchase arrangements under which it purchased mortgage backed securities 
these securities are collateral for the million in short term debt as well as the million in long term debt 
in july  the company entered into a term note with an unaffiliated financial institution for million 
this note was paid in full upon maturity 
during  bancgroup entered into a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution totaling million of which none was outstanding at december  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity bancgroup has addressed its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through its policies and structure for asset liability management 
it has created the asset liability management committee almco  the objective of which is to optimize the net interest margin while assuming reasonable business risks 
almco annually establishes operating constraints for critical elements of bancgroup s business  such as liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
almco constantly monitors performance and takes action in order to meet its objectives 
of primary concern to almco  is maintaining adequate liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
the consolidated statement of cash flows identifies the three major sources and uses of cash liquidity as operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities reflect cash generated from operations 
management views cash flow from operations as a major source of liquidity 
investing activities represent a primary usage of cash with the major net increase being attributed to loan growth 
when securities mature they are generally reinvested in new securities or assets held for sale 
financing activities generally provide funding for the growth in loans and securities with increased deposits 
short term borrowings are used to provide funding for temporary gaps in the funding of long term assets and deposits  as well as to provide funding for mortgage loans held for sale and loan growth 
bancgroup has the ability to tap other markets for certificates of deposits and to utilize established lines for federal funds purchased and fhlb advances 
bancgroup maintains and builds diversified funding sources in order to provide flexibility in meeting its requirements 
from through  the significant changes in bancgroup s cash flows have centered on loan growth and fluctuations in mortgage loans held for sale 
loan growth of billion in and million in has been one of the principal uses of cash in both years 
mortgage loans held for sale decreased in providing million in funds compared to an increase in using million in funds 
the increase in deposits  excluding acquisitions  of million in and million in provided the primary source of funding for internal loan growth 
short term borrowings  excluding acquisitions decreased million in and increased million in as a result of the funding requirements of mortgage loans held for sale and internal loan growth 
management has chosen to fund fluctuations in the volume of mortgage loans held for sale with short term borrowings as opposed to increasing rate sensitive deposits 
bancgroup had billion and billion of residential real estate loans at december  and  respectively 
these loans provide collateral for the current billion credit facility at the fhlb 
at december   the fhlb unused line of credit was million of which million was available based on current collateral 
this line provides the company significant flexibility in asset liability management  liquidity and deposit pricing 
on march   colonial bank issued million in subordinated notes due march  these notes are not subject to redemption prior to maturity and pay interest semiannually on march and september this subordinated debt qualifies as tier ii capital 
in july  the company entered into a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution totaling million of which none was outstanding at december  this facility bears interest at a rate of above libor and expires in july in  bancgroup entered into reverse repurchase arrangements under which it purchased mortgage backed securities 
at december  these securities are collateral for the million in short term debt as well as the million in long term debt 
during  and in connection with the acquisition of asb bancshares  inc  bancgroup issued million of variable rate subordinated debentures 
the debentures bear interest equal to the new york prime rate minus but not less than 
bancgroup had an outstanding term note with an unaffiliated financial institution in the amount of million at december  which was paid in full upon maturity 
in january  bancgroup issued million in trust preferred securities 
these securities qualify as tier i capital and carry an interest rate 
a portion of the proceeds of the offering was utilized to pay off a term note and revolving debt outstanding 
the remainder of the proceeds was used for acquisitions and other business purposes 
bancgroup has outstanding  million and million of bank owned life insurance boli at december  and  respectively 
this long term asset represents life insurance purchased from highly rated insurance companies on certain employees with the bank named as the beneficiary 
the company considers these funds available for the future payment of benefits due the employee s beneficiaries from group benefit plans 
management believes its liquidity sources and funding strategies are adequate given the nature of its asset base and current loan demand 
the primary uses of funds as reflected in the holding company only statement of cash flows note were million for the payment of interest on debt  million for the reduction of short term borrowings and million for the payment of dividends 
the holding company s primary sources of funds were million in dividends received from its subsidiaries 
dividends payable by national and state banks in any year  without prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities  are limited to the bank s net profits as defined for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
under these limitations  approximately million of retained earnings plus certain earnings would be available for distribution to bancgroup  from its subsidiaries  as dividends in without prior approval from the respective regulatory authorities 
the holding company anticipates that the cash flow needs of the holding company are well below the regulatory dividend restrictions of its subsidiary bank 
at december   bancgroup s liquidity position was adequate with loan maturities of billion  or of the total loan portfolio  due within one year 
securities totaling billion or of the total portfolio also had maturities within one year or have been classified as available for sale 
as of december   there were  however  no current plans to dispose of any significant portion of these securities 
in addition bancgroup has million in additional borrowing capacity at the fhlb  million available through a warehouse line with fhlb  million from fed fund lines and million from a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution 
bancgroup s asset liability management policy has also established targets for interest rate sensitivity 
changes in interest rates will necessarily lead to changes in the net interest margin 
it is almco s goal to minimize volatility in the net interest margin by taking an active role in managing the level  mix and maturities of assets and liabilities and by analyzing and taking action to manage mismatch and basis risk 
the interest sensitivity schedule reflects a negative gap at months  therefore  bancgroup has a greater exposure to net income if interest rates increase 
bancgroup s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools 
one measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis 
the following table measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of interest sensitive assets  interest sensitive liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december  percentage change in basis points net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
management has managed the asset liability position of the bank through traditional sources discussed above 
additionally  as previously discussed  the company has developed a strategy to hedge its msr asset against future fluctuations in interest rates through the use of hedging instruments 
the objective of this strategy is to maintain a correlation over time between the value of msr and the servicing hedge 
at december   the company had hedged approximately of its msr asset 
refer to more detailed discussions of the hedging activities included in management s discussion under mortgage servicing rights and servicing hedge and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes bancgroup s interest rate sensitivity at december  at december  interest sensitive within total over balance days days days years years in thousands rate sensitive assets federal funds sold and resale agreements   investment securities       securities available for sale       mortgage loans held for sale   loans  net of unearned income       allowances for possible loan losses       net loans       nonearning assets   total assets       rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing demand deposits      savings deposits      certificates of deposits less than       certificates of deposits more than       iras      open time deposits      short term borrowings     long term debt     noncosting liabilities equity   total liabilities equity       gap      cumulative gap     the two lines of the preceding table is the interest rate sensitivity gap that is the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
in reviewing the table  it should be noted that the balances are shown for a specific point in time and  because the interest sensitivity position is dynamic  it can change significantly over time 
for all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  variable rate assets and liabilities are reflected in the time interval of the assets or liabilities earliest repricing date 
fixed rate assets and liabilities have been allocated to various time intervals based on contractual repayment 
furthermore  the balances reflect contractual repricing of the deposits and management s position on repricing certain deposits where management discretion is permitted 
prepayment assumptions are applied at a constant rate based on the company s historical experience 
certain demand deposit accounts and regular savings accounts have been classified as repricing beyond one year in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
while these accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  experience and analysis have shown them to be relatively rate insensitive 
if these accounts were included in the day category  the gap in that time frame would be a negative billion with a corresponding cumulative gap at one year of negative billion 
capital adequacy and resources management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to protect shareholders and depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
management s strategy to achieve these goals is to retain sufficient earnings while providing a reasonable return to shareholders in the form of dividends and return on equity 
the company s dividend payout ratio target range is 
dividend rates are determined by the board of directors in consideration of several factors including current and projected capital ratios  liquidity and income levels and other bank dividend yields and payment ratios 
the amount of a cash dividend  if any  rests with the discretion of the board of directors of bancgroup as well as upon applicable statutory constraints such as the delaware law requirement that dividends may be paid only out of capital surplus or net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding fiscal year 
bancgroup also has access to equity capital markets through both public and private issuances 
management considers these sources and related return in addition to internally generated capital in evaluating future expansion or acquisition opportunities 
the federal reserve board has issued guidelines identifying minimum tier i leverage ratios relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is but is increased from to basis points based on a review of individual banks by the federal reserve 
the minimum risk adjusted capital ratios established by the federal reserve are for tier i and for total capital 
bancgroup s actual capital ratios and the components of capital and risk adjusted asset information subject to regulatory review as of december  are stated below capital thousands tier i capital shareholders equity excluding unrealized gain on securities available for sale  disallowed msrs and intangibles plus trust preferred securities  tier ii capital allowable loan loss reserve  subordinated debt  total capital  risk adjusted assets thousands  total assets thousands  tier i leverage ratio risk adjusted capital ratios tier i capital ratio total capital ratio bancgroup has increased capital gradually through normal earnings retention as well as through stock registrations to capitalize acquisitions 
the increases in the ratios shown above are primarily due to normal earnings retention partially offset by asset growth 
the total capital ratio also increased due to the previously discussed issuance in march of million in subordinated debentures which qualifies as tier ii capital 
regulatory restrictions as noted previously  dividends payable by national and state banks in any year  without prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities  are limited 
colonial bank is also required by law to maintain noninterest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank to meet regulatory reserve requirements 
at december   these deposits were not material to bancgroup s funding requirements 
financial accounting standards board releases in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
under this statement  an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
on september   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment to delay the effective date of sfas no 
the effective date for this statement will be delayed from fiscal years beginning after june  to fiscal years beginning after june  management is currently evaluating the impact that sfas no 
and sfas no 
will have on bancgroup s financial statements 
on october   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for mortgage backed securities after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  the company is not currently involved in these activities and therefore the adoption of sfas no 
has had no impact on bancgroup s financial statements
