item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations general at december   we owned and operated o charley s restaurants in alabama  florida  georgia  indiana  kentucky  mississippi  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
o charley s are full service  casual dining restaurants which appeal to traditional casual dining customers as well as value oriented customers by offering high quality food at moderate pricing with outstanding service 
our restaurants are open seven days a week  and most offer alcoholic beverages as well as food 
we expect to increase revenues by opening new units and by increasing same store sales 
our growth strategy is to continue fully penetrating existing and new targeted major metropolitan areas while opening new units in smaller secondary markets in close proximity to our major markets 
we operate a commissary for the primary purpose of providing our restaurants with consistent quality food products which meet our specifications while obtaining the best possible prices for those items 
the majority of the food products served in our restaurants are distributed to the stores by the commissary 
in addition to purchasing food and supply products  the commissary manufactures certain proprietary products and ages and cuts red meat into steaks in its usda approved meat facility 
all sales from the commissary to the restaurants are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires that preopening and start up costs be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
before the accounting change  preopening costs were amortized over one year 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change totaled million pre tax and million net of tax  or per diluted share 
earnings before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle were million  or per diluted share  in as compared with million  or per diluted share  for the following table reflects changes in the number of company owned restaurants for the periods presented restaurants in operation  beginning of period restaurants opened restaurants acquired from franchisee in operation  end of period revenues consist of restaurant sales and to a lesser extent commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s label food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
consistent with industry trends  liquor sales as a percentage of restaurant sales has declined in each of the last three fiscal years 
we have historically maintained a kids eat free program where we provide meals from a selected menu to kids years old and under 
in select markets  we are currently offering a value oriented kids program where we provide a meal from a kid s menu  which includes a beverage and dessert for a set price 
the results indicate that there are no material differences in profitability at restaurants that implement the value oriented kid s program 
cost of food  beverage and supplies primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather  cause periodic fluctuations in food costs 
generally  temporary increases are absorbed and are not passed on to customers  however  we typically adjust menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for store level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates store management for achieving and exceeding certain store level financial targets and performance goals 
currently  congress is contemplating an increase in the federal minimum wage rate and it appears an increase is imminent 
we typically pay our employees more than minimum wage  thus  we do not expect an immediate adverse effect on our financial performance from such an increase 
however  as in prior years  we do expect that overall wage inflation will be higher for several years following any minimum wage increase that may effect payroll costs in the future 
restaurant operating costs includes occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and expenses  management training salaries  property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
restaurant operating margin is defined as restaurant sales less cost of restaurant sales 
cost of restaurant sales  for purposes of this discussion  consists of cost of food  beverage and supplies  payroll and benefits and restaurant operating costs 
advertising  general and administrative expenses includes all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life and prior to  includes amortization of preopening costs for new restaurants  which includes costs of hiring and training the initial staff and certain other costs 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues may increase as the number of new store openings increases 
preopening costs include operating costs and expenses incurred prior to a new restaurant opening 
beginning in the first quarter of  preopening costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with sop rather than capitalized and amortized over one year as was the practice prior to the implementation of this new accounting pronouncement 
this new accounting method affects when preopening costs are expensed and may impact earnings relative to the previous method on a quarter to quarter and year to year basis depending on when these costs are incurred 
we will continue to capture preopening costs  but will now reflect these expenses on a separate line item labeled preopening costs on the statement of earnings rather than reporting these costs in the depreciation and amortization line item 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one year will include costs associated with new stores opening during that particular year and most likely will include costs associated with stores expected to open subsequent to that year 
we typically incur average preopening costs of approximately  for each new store 
the following section should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein

fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new restaurants and an increase in same store sales of 
in march  we increased menu prices by approximately 
cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies decreased to in from in we attribute these lower food cost percentages primarily to three factors we took a menu price increase in march  which increased the average check  the cost of several food items decreased  and we improved our purchasing and operating efficiencies in our stores and commissary 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in red meat costs 
currently  we are anticipating further increases in red meat costs in there can be no assurance that events outside our control will not result in increased food costs 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales increased slightly to in from in the increase was attributable to higher store level bonuses and increasing wage rates and salaries for restaurant support staff and management in those higher wages and salaries were partially offset by economies achieved from higher average unit sales volumes  reduced hourly turnover and from certain employee benefit cost reductions 
our markets generally have low unemployment rates and we compete with other restaurants for employees 
we anticipate continued wage rate increases in but do not expect an immediate material impact which would adversely effect our operations 
restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management training salaries and benefits related to the hiring and training of new store managers assigned to stores opening in additionally  we entered two new major markets in  charlotte  north carolina in the first quarter and columbus  ohio in the second quarter  which increased certain supervision costs 
typically  we incur higher initial supervision and other operating costs when entering new markets 
we did not enter any new major market in restaurant operating margin increased to million in from million in restaurant operating margin  as a percentage of restaurant sales  improved to in from in this improvement is due primarily to decreases in food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales 
advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  advertising  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total sales  remained at in depreciation and amortization in increased  or  to million from million in we adopted sop in the first quarter of  which requires preopening costs to be expensed as incurred 
previously  we capitalized preopening costs and amortized these amounts over one year from the opening of each store 
the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in included preopening cost amortization of million 
preopening costs are now recorded in a separate line item category and the depreciation and amortization line  beginning in  no longer includes any preopening cost amortization 
excluding the preopening cost amortization  depreciation expense in increased million  or  to million from million in the increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to additional capital expenditures for new units and remodeling of certain existing units 
preopening costs  excluding the one time cumulative adjustment for the change in accounting principle as measured under sop  were million in as a percentage of total revenue  preopening costs were in  compared to preopening cost amortization of in income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in interest expense  net increased million in to million from million in the increase is primarily related to the increased borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our long term debt by million with the net proceeds received from the sale of common stock  which reduced interest expense in earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for increased million or  to million from million in the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  net of tax  recorded in the first quarter of and included in results  represented the write off of unamortized preopening costs in accordance with sop the million of unamortized preopening costs remaining on our balance sheet at december  was written off in this one time adjustment 
after adjusting for the tax benefit  the net cumulative effect was million 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new restaurants  an increase in same store sales of and the acquisition of our remaining franchisee s operations 
the increase in same store sales was the result of an increase in customer traffic of approximately and an increase in the average check of approximately  which was primarily the result of a menu price increase taken in march cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies remained at 
although the overall food cost percentage remained the same  there were some items that positively and negatively effected food cost 
our menu price increase in march and improved operating efficiencies lowered food cost as a percentage of sales 
these improvements were offset by cost increases in poultry  primarily chicken tenders  red meat  cheese and dairy products and potatoes 
except for those food items mentioned above  the impact of inflation on food cost was minimal 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in consistent with the previous year  we continued to achieve a lower payroll cost as a percentage of restaurant sales due to the economies achieved from higher average unit sales volumes  reduced management and hourly turnover and from certain employee benefit cost reductions 
store level bonus increases and higher average wage rates partially offset the decreases in payroll and benefit costs 
restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  restaurant operating costs decreased to in from 
this decrease is primarily attributable to economies generated from higher average unit volumes and lower rent expense as we have generally purchased our restaurant sites in recent years 
decreases in the restaurant operating cost percentage were partially offset by higher bonuses earned by supervisor and regional level management and by increases in training expenses for store management 
each of the supervisors and regional managers participate in an incentive based compensation plan tied directly to their financial results and performance goals 
we increased management training in to prepare for the additional units opened in including stores in two new geographical markets  charlotte  north carolina and columbus  ohio 
typically  we incur higher initial supervision and other operating costs when entering new markets 
we did not enter any new major market in restaurant operating margin increased to million in from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  restaurant operating margin improved to in from in this improvement is due to the increases in overall average sales and decreases in payroll and benefit costs and other restaurant operating cost as a percentage of sales 
advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  advertising  general and administrative expenses decreased to from 
advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in amortization of preopening expenses remained at of total revenue in while depreciation expense increased to of total revenue in from in the increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to additional capital expenditures for the remodeling of certain existing stores 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in after adjusting for the interest expense reduction in  earnings before income taxes increased million  or to million from million in interest expense  net decreased  in to million from million in we reduced our long term debt by approximately million in the fourth quarter of from the net proceeds received from the sale of common stock that reduced interest expense in income tax expense increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense was in versus in this reduction is primarily attributable to an overall lower state income tax expense in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been generated from cash provided by operations  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and additions to capitalized lease obligations 
our principal capital needs arise primarily from the purchase and development of new restaurants  equipment replacement and improvements to existing restaurants 
property and equipment additions were million in of these additions  million were made primarily for new stores opened during the year  stores under construction at december   improvements to existing restaurants  and million was used for the construction of a new commissary freezer placed in operation in the fourth quarter of additionally  we repaid million  net  in principal on our long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
these cash outlays were funded primarily by million in cash provided by operations  net borrowings of million under our revolving credit agreement the revolver and borrowings of approximately million under capitalized lease obligations 
the total increase in cash was  in we believe we will need additional capital of approximately million in to fund capital expenditures for the planned to new restaurants and for improvements to existing units 
as of december   we had eleven restaurants under construction  seven to eight of which are expected to open during the first quarter of we are currently in discussions concerning the purchase of the existing commissary and home office land and building facilities  which are currently occupied under an operating lease 
we estimate the cost to purchase the commissary and home office facilities to be approximately to million 
financing to fund these projects is currently being evaluated and would likely include borrowings under the revolver or off balance sheet financing 
actual capital expenditures in may vary from the above estimate based on a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of future restaurant sites 
we intend to continue financing the furniture  fixtures and equipment for our new stores with capitalized lease obligations 
on january   the revolver was amended and restated to extend the maturity date and increase the maximum borrowing capacity to million from million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolver and bore interest at an average rate of 
the maturity date was extended until may  the maturity date may be extended annually by one year  at the participating banks option  beginning on each anniversary of the revolver 
the revolver imposes restrictions on us with respect to the maintenance of certain financial ratios  the incurrence of indebtedness  and the sale of assets  mergers and the payment of dividends 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions 
at december   the working capital deficiency and the current ratio were million and to  respectively 
on september   the board of directors of the company approved the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares had been repurchased 
through march    additional shares were repurchased 
we continually evaluate the best uses of our capital and may repurchase additional shares in the future 
during  we believe that available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under the revolver and capitalized lease obligations will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital outlays 
our growth strategy includes the consideration of acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any such acquisitions  or joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
year we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our financial or operating activities caused by the failure of our computerized systems  or those of our suppliers  resulting from year conversion issues 
we do not expect year conversion issues to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial results in impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly co workers 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
we may attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at existing restaurants
