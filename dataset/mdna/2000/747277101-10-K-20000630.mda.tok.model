item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this document 
the company undertakes no obligation to update the information contained in this item results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations and percentage of total revenues in our consolidated statements of income fiscal year ended april  march  march  in thousands net revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    operating expenses engineering and development    selling and marketing    general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating income    net revenues our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of scsi and fibre channel based i o products and enclosure management products 
we also license certain designs and receive royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees 
net revenues in fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of a million increase in sales of scsi products  a million increase in sales of fibre channel products  and a million increase in ide based royalties 
net revenues in fiscal increased million or from fiscal to million 
the increase was the result of a million increase in sales of scsi products  a million increase in sales of fibre channel products  and a million increase in ide based royalties 
export revenues primarily to pacific rim countries in fiscal year increased million or from fiscal to approximately million 
export revenues in fiscal increased million or from fiscal  to approximately million 
as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year these increases are primarily due to increased sales to customers in japan and to a lesser extent  europe 
export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
we do not expect the uncertainty in selected pacific rim foreign currency markets to have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our six largest customers accounted for approximately of net revenues in fiscal years and  and in fiscal year in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  and sun microsystems accounted for of the companies net revenues 
in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  and sun microsystems accounted for of the company s net revenues 
in fiscal  fujitsu limited accounted for of net revenues  sun microsystems accounted for  of net revenues 
we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternate or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit cost of revenues consist primarily of raw materials including wafers and completed chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test labor  overhead and warranty costs 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  an increase from in fiscal the percentage growth was due to the increasing contribution of license fees combined with the continuing introduction of new  higher margin products and volume related cost reductions on mature products 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  an increase from in fiscal the percentage increase was due to the introduction of new  higher margin products and volume related cost reductions on mature products  combined with improved quality resulting in reduced scrap expenses 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was  an increase from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage increase was due to a shift in product mix to products with lower unit costs  as well as increased production volumes 
additionally  multiple disciplines within the company worked together to improve inventory management 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon wafers  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly more difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result  we do not anticipate gross profit percentage to increase at a rate consistent with historic trends 
operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  development related material  occupancy costs  and computer support 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
as a result  we expect that engineering and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal engineering and development expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in spending each fiscal year was largely due to increased levels of spending for fibre channel  ide  and scsi design and engineering support 
in fiscal year we incurred a million charge for acquired in process technology relating to the acquisition of adaptiveraid r technology from borg adaptive technologies  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nstor corporation 
at the time of the acquisition  the adaptiveraid r technology was in the development stage with no completed commercially viable storage solution products 
the technology purchased had  at the time of acquisition  several in process research and development projects that were substantially incomplete 
the major projects acquired included a a pci raid controller  b a raid bridge controller  and c a storage area network raid controller for the intel architecture server and workstation market 
the company s primary purpose for the acquisition was to acquire these in process projects and complete the development efforts as the company believed they had economic value but had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
therefore  the company has recorded the purchase price as a one time charge for in process research and development of million to engineering and development expense in the fourth fiscal quarter ended april  the company is continuing development efforts and does not currently have an estimate as to when the first new products will begin to ship 
in fiscal year we incurred a million charge for acquired in process technology relating to the acquisition of silicon design resources  inc selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing salaries  sales commissions and related expenses  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
we believe continued investments of these type of expenses are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding relationships with our customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increases in dollars reflected an increased level of sales commissions paid as a result of the increase in revenues 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal relates to economies of scale realized from the growth in net revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  human resources and information technology personnel 
non personnel related expenses consist of recruiting fees  professional services and corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs relating to the growth of the business and our operation as a public company 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues this amounted to in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in fiscal salaries and fringe benefits increased by million due to an increase in general and administrative personnel 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues is due to our benefits realized from economies of scale related to the increases in net revenue 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year from fiscal year due to an increase in outside services related to the acquisition of silicon design resources  inc and an increase in general and administrative personnel 
non operating income interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million in fiscal  million in  and million in fiscal the increases in interest and other income in fiscal  and are largely due to increases in cash equivalents and investment balances due to million in net proceeds received from a secondary stock offering in the second quarter of fiscal additionally  cash equivalent and investment balances have increased due to cash flow from operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
income tax provision our effective tax rates were approximately in fiscal and fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in tax rates in fiscal and fiscal are due to benefits realized from research and development and other tax credits as well as the movement of a portion of our investments into tax exempt securities 
the decrease in tax rate in fiscal is due to the decrease in the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets  and to a lesser extent  the movement of a portion of the our investments into tax exempt securities 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  hedging activities  and exposure definition 
sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers the effective date of sfas to all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
although we continue to review the effect of the implementation of sfas and sfas  we do not currently believe their adoption will have a material impact on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations and do not believe adoption will result in significant changes to our financial risk management practices 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the objective of this sab is to provide further guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
we are required to follow the guidance in the sab no later than fiscal year the sec has recently indicated it intends to issue further guidance with respect to adoption of specific issues addressed by sab until such time as this additional guidance is issued  we are unable to assess the impact  if any  it may have on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  we believe that the impact of fin will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments have increased to million at april  compared to million at march  the increase was attributable to positive cash flow from operations  primarily net income growth  during the twelve months ended april  our primary source of liquidity is derived from working capital and cash from operations 
we also have an unused million unsecured line of credit with silicon valley bank 
working capital increased million to million from march  to april  the increase in working capital in the fiscal year ended april  was largely attributable to positive cash flow from operations 
the million line of credit facility with silicon valley bank allows us to borrow at the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility expires on july   and  although there can be no assurance  we currently expect to renew this line of credit 
there are no borrowings under this credit facility at april  our cash flow provided by operations was million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the growth in cash provided by operations compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in profitability 
additionally  in fiscal  cash flow from operations was improved by increases in income taxes payable and accrued compensation balances  and was offset by increases in accounts and notes receivable  inventories and other current assets 
our inventory turns decreased to in fiscal from in the comparable prior year period largely due to the increase in inventory at calendar year end for year related contingency plans 
our cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to increases in additions to property and equipment and the acquisition of adaptiveraid r technology 
additions to property and equipment were million in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the fiscal year additions to property and equipment included million for the new corporate headquarters in aliso viejo  california 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also paid million for the acquisition of the adaptiveraid r technology 
our cash flow provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the fiscal year increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increases in proceeds from issuance of stock under employee stock plans 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments  debt facilities and cash flows from operating activities will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the information in this report constitutes forward looking statements 
when used in this report the words shall  should  forecast  all of  projected  believes  anticipates  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  the company may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
the company wishes to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this report 
our operating results fluctuate significantly which could cause our stock price to decline if our results fail to meet investors and analysts expectations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current profitability in the future 
a significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
in the past  a significant percentage of our quarterly bookings and sales to major customers occurred during the last month of the quarter  and there can be no assurance that this trend will not return in the future 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products 
material fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be the result of changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of our major customers  customer order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of our products  negotiations of rebates and extended payment terms  or changes in our ability to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders 
some large original equipment manufacturer customers may require us to maintain higher levels of inventory or field warehouses in an attempt to minimize their own inventories 
in addition  we must order our products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  and because the markets for our products are subject to rapid technological and price changes  there is a risk we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventory of particular products 
if we produce excess or insufficient inventory or are required to hold excess inventory  our operating results could be adversely affected 
other factors that could cause our sales and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include the time  availability and sale of new products  seasonal original equipment manufacturer customer demand  changes in the mix of products having differing gross margins  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon wafers  warranty expenses  variations in product development and other operating expenses  revenue adjustments related to product returns  or adoption of new accounting pronouncements and or changes in our policies and general economic and other conditions effecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
our quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including the pricing and availability of our products  and our competitors products 
although we do not maintain our own wafer manufacturing facility  large portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet our expectations  our fixed expenses would exacerbate the effect on net income of such shortfall in net revenues 
furthermore  announcements regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products 
order deferrals by our customers  delays in our introduction of new products  and longer than anticipated design in cycles for our products have in the past adversely effected our quarterly results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and as a result  the price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
we depend on a limited number of customers and any decrease in revenue from any one of our customers could cause our stock price to decline 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of these customers are based in the pacific rim  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
in addition  a majority of our customers order products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  which could materially adversely effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers merging or acquiring another of our customers 
as our original equipment manufacturer customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we provide some customers with price protection in the event that we reduce the price of our products 
while we maintain reserves for this price protection  the impact of any future price reductions could exceed our reserves in any specific fiscal period 
any price protection in excess of recorded reserves could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
the markets for both peripheral and host computer products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
we currently compete primarily with adaptec  lsi logic  and cirrus logic in the scsi sector of the i o market 
in the fibre channel sector of the i o market  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  lsi logic  emulex corporation  jni and adaptec 
in the integrated drive electronics  or ide sector  we compete with stmicroelectronics and cirrus logic 
in the enclosure management sector  we compete primarily with lsi logic and vitesse semiconductor 
we may compete with some of our larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop i o controller integrated circuits for use in their own products 
at least one large original equipment manufacturer customer in the past has decided to vertically integrate and has therefore stopped purchasing from us 
we will need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while we continue to devote significant resources to research and development  these efforts may not be successful or may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner 
further  several of our competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity because of long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of scsi and other i o products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in these markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these competitors 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches 
because of short product life cycles and even shorter design cycles  our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to achieve design wins in next generation systems 
a design win usually ensures a customer will purchase the product until a higher performance standard is available or a competitor can demonstrate a significant price performance advantage 
most of our products compete with products available from several companies  many of which have substantially greater research and development  long term guaranteed supply capacity  marketing and financial resources  manufacturing capability and customer support organizations than those of ours 
because of the complexity of our products  we have experienced delays from time to time in completing products on a timely basis 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  our future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on our relationships with wafer suppliers and other subcontractors and a loss of these relationships may lead to unpredictable consequences which may harm our results of operations if alternative supply sources are not available 
we currently rely on several independent foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
generally  we conduct business with some of our foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts 
therefore  these foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specified price 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a foundry is otherwise interrupted  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
as a result  we may not be able to meet customer demands which could harm our business 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we are continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
new supply sources may not be able or willing to satisfy our wafer requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 
we use multiple sources of supply for some of our products which may require customers to perform separate product qualifications 
we have not developed alternate sources of supply for all of our products and our newly introduced products are typically produced initially by a single foundry until alternate sources can be qualified 
in particular  our integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy our requirements for this technology  our marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  our results of operations could be materially and adversely effected 
the requirement that a customer perform separate product qualifications or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from us may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from our competitors 
our ability to obtain satisfactory wafer and other supplies is subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include the possibility that our suppliers may be subject to injunctions arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights 
the enforcement of this kind of injunction could impede a supplier s ability to provide wafers  components or packaging services to us 
in addition  our flexibility to move production of any particular product from one foundry to another is limited because such a move can require significant re engineering  which may take several quarters 
these efforts also divert engineering resources that could otherwise be dedicated to new product development  which would adversely affect new product development schedules 
therefore  our production could be constrained even though capacity is available at one or more foundries 
in addition  we could encounter supply shortages if sales grow substantially 
we use domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly of our semiconductor products purchased in wafer form  and for assembly of our host adapter board products 
our reliance on independent subcontractors to provide these services involves a number of risks  including the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
we are also subject to the risks of shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of our products 
in addition  we may receive orders for large volumes of products to be shipped within short periods  and we may not have sufficient testing capacity to fill these orders 
constraints or delays in the supply of our products  whether because of capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at our foundries or subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers 
we may need to engage in financially risky transactions to guarantee we have production capacity which may require us to seek additional financing and result in dilution to our stockholders 
the semiconductor industry and we have  in the past  experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  we may consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods or equity investments in  or advances to  wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these transactions would involve financial risk to us and could require us to commit a substantial amount of our funds or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
the need to commit our own funds may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
this kind of additional financing  if necessary  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we rely on the high performance computer and computer peripheral markets and any unpredictable fluctuations or reductions in demand for products in these markets may adversely effect our results of operations 
a significant portion of our host adapter board products and hard disk drive controller products are ultimately used in high performance file servers  workstations and other office automation products 
our growth has been supported by increasing demand for sophisticated i o solutions which support database systems  servers  workstations  internet intranet applications  multimedia and telecommunications 
if the demand for these systems slows  our business could be adversely affected 
as a supplier of controller products to manufacturers of computer peripherals such as disk drives and other data storage devices  a portion of our business is dependent on the overall market for computer peripherals 
this market is itself dependent on the market for computers  and has historically been characterized by periods of rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and contraction 
as a result  suppliers to the computer peripherals industry from time to time experience large and sudden fluctuations in demand for their products as their customers adjust to changing conditions in their markets 
if these fluctuations are not accurately anticipated  such suppliers  including us  could produce excessive or insufficient inventories of various components  which could have a negative impact on our business 
our financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
the markets in which our competitors and we compete involve rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
our future success depends on our ability to do the following enhance our current products and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and adequately address original equipment manufacturer customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe that to remain competitive in the future we will need to continue to develop new products  which will require a significant investment in new product development 
in anticipation of the implementation of fibre channel data transfer interface technologies  we have invested  and will continue to invest  significant resources in developing our integrated circuit single chip peripheral computer interface  or pci to fibre channel controllers 
however  fibre channel may not be adopted as a predominant industry standard 
we are aware of products for alternative i o standards and enabling technologies being developed by our competitors 
we believe that some competitors  including adaptec  have extensive development efforts related to products based on new parallel scsi i o technology 
if this kind of alternative standard is adopted by the industry  we may not be able to develop products for the new standard in a timely manner 
further  even if fibre channel is adopted  our integrated pci to fibre channel controller may not be fully developed in time to be accepted for use in fibre channel technology 
if it is developed on time  we may not be able to manufacture it at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
in the event that fibre channel is not adopted as an industry standard  or our integrated circuit pci to fibre channel controllers are not timely developed or do not gain market acceptance  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our fibre channel products have been designed to conform to a standard that has yet to be uniformly adopted 
our products must be designed to operate effectively with a variety of hardware and software products supplied by other manufacturers  including microprocessors  operating system software and peripherals 
we depend on significant cooperation with these manufacturers in order to achieve our design objectives and produce products that interoperate successfully 
while we believe that we generally have good relationships with leading microprocessor  systems and peripheral suppliers  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will not make it more difficult for us to design our products for successful interoperability 
if industry acceptance of these standards was to decline or if they were replaced with new standards  and if we did not anticipate these changes and develop new products  our business could be adversely affected 
we anticipate engaging in acquisitions  however these acquisitions may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price if they do not complement our business 
we anticipate that our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with ours 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including uncertainties in identifying and pursuing acquisitions  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience  the potential loss of current customers and or retention of the acquired company s customers  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
further  we may never enjoy the perceived benefits of an acquisition 
we may not be effective in identifying and completing attractive acquisitions or managing future growth 
future acquisitions by us could dilute stockholders  and cause us to incur debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely affect our business 
with respect to accounting for future business combinations  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has announced it may abolish the pooling of interests accounting treatment 
the standard  as currently proposed would affect transactions after january  if the fasb does eliminate pooling of interests accounting treatment  we may not be able to complete a business combination without incurring goodwill or other intangible assets  which would reduce our reported earnings 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our future success largely depends on our key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers 
we also must identify and hire additional personnel 
if we lose the services of key personnel  our business would be adversely affected 
we believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future  or to manage our business  both in the united states and abroad 
because we depend on foreign customers and suppliers  we are subject to international economic  regulatory and political risks which could harm our financial condition 
we expect that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant number of our customers and suppliers are located in japan 
recently  the asian markets have suffered property price deflation 
this asset deflation has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these deflationary pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with spare industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
our export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and infringement claims or adverse judgments could harm our competitive position 
although we have patent protection on some aspects of our technology in some jurisdictions  we rely primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be negatively impacted 
intellectual property claims have been made against us in the past  and patent or other intellectual property infringement claims could be made against us in the future 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
in addition  if we litigate these kinds of claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from other matters 
our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
our supply of wafers and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers 
our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
from january  through may   the market price has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
future announcements concerning us or our competitors or customers  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  and the potential for a shareholder lawsuit  or changes in accounting policies  among other factors  could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile
