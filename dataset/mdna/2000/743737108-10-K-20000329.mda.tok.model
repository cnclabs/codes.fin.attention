item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications signals  and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation and amortization  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management were to take specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international  national and regional economic conditions 
third  the volume of capitalized track or recollectable projects performed by the company s maintenance of way and communications signals departments can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses 
the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses  and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year one of the company s customers  tilcon connecticut  inc  which ships construction aggregate from three separate quarries on the company s system to asphalt production plants in connecticut and new york  accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in  and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to offset the decrease in operating revenues

   other    total    less capitalized and recovered costs    total    ii year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues operating revenues decreased  or to million in from million in this decrease was comprised of a million decrease in conventional freight revenue  and a  decrease in non freight operating revenues partially offset by a  increase in net container freight revenues 
the decrease in conventional freight revenues is attributable to a decrease in traffic volume and to a decrease in the average revenue received per conventional car loading of 
the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased by  or  to  in from  in on june  the rail lines and operations of consolidated rail corporation conrail  with which the company has historically interchanged the majority of its rail freight traffic  were split between csx corporation and norfolk southern railroad 
the company estimates that delays and other service problems attributable to this split up accounted for a traffic reduction of nearly carloadings which were diverted to truck 
the company believes that most of this traffic will be returned to rail once the service problems related to the conrail split up have been overcome 
while the situation has improved  service problems still remained as of the end of during  two of the company s rail freight customers continued to phase out operations which utilized the company s rail freight services 
reduced traffic to these two customers accounted for a reduction of approximately carloadings during the year 
it is anticipated that these two customers will complete the phase out of their rail freight served operations over the next year or two 
the company did experience increased rail freight traffic from several new customers and from certain existing customers which partially offset the traffic declines discussed above 
the reduction in the average revenue received per conventional carloading  between years  is largely attributable to a change in the mix of freight hauled toward lower revenue commodities 
management believes that the average freight received per carloading should increase in the future as freight  temporarily lost to conrail split up related service problems  returns to the railroads 
the increase in container freight revenue was primarily the result of increased container traffic volume 
total intermodal containers handled increased by  or to  containers in from  containers in the average revenue received per intermodal container increased by approximately 
due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
the increases in container traffic volume results from both new customers and increased volume from existing customers 
the decrease in non freight operating revenues is attributable to decreases in billings for demurrage  secondary switching and other transportation related services 
such revenues can vary from year to year depending upon traffic volumes and customer requirements 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues operating ratio increased to in from in while operating expenses have risen generally across the board  the most significant increase was in the area of salaries  wages  payroll taxes and employee benefits which increased  or  to million in from million in this increase results from additional employees hired throughout  increases in the average rates of pay due to semi annual cost of living adjustments and pay rate increases mandated by union contracts and from higher costs of payroll taxes and employee health and welfare benefits 
in addition the amount expended for diesel fuel increased by  or  between years due to the increased cost of petroleum products  and depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or as a result of recent additions to property and equipment and amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of connecticut central railroad company 
other income other income decreased by  or to million in from million in the principal items of income in this category for were million derived from the sale of long term fiber optics cable licenses and ii  related to the recovery of the portion of an environmental claim paid by the company in prior years

increase in conventional freight revenues 
the increase in container freight revenues was primarily the result of an increase in traffic volume 
total intermodal containers handled increased by  or  to  containers in from  containers in the average rate received per intermodal container increased slightly due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
conventional freight revenues remained relatively unchanged between years despite the fact that the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased by  or  to  carloadings in from  carloadings in the average revenue received per conventional carloading increased by a comparable percentage  however  due to a shift in the relative volume of commodities handled toward higher revenue commodities 
the company s conventional freight volume was adversely affected during the latter part of by the global recession  which resulted in reduced shipments of scrap metal and us made steel 
in addition  delayed award of highway construction projects caused a decline in shipments of construction aggregate used in the production of asphalt 
scrap metal and construction aggregates command a comparatively lower freight rate than many of the other commodities handled by the company 
decreases in these commodities were partially offset by increases in volumes of inbound raw materials to many of the company s manufacturing customers 
such traffic volumes increased by approximately in and reflect a revitalization of the southern new england manufacturing base as well as the company s successful marketing efforts 
the  increase in non freight operating revenues resulted primarily from increases in maintenance of way department billings 
such revenues can vary from year to year depending upon the needs of rail customers and other outside parties 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues operating ratio increased to in from in the increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to a number of factors among which are the following o the number of employees on the company s payroll increased during from to o profit sharing expense for increased by  to  from  in the increase is attributable to the substantial increase in other non operating income generated in o total capitalized track expense and recovered costs for totaled million  a  decrease from  when such costs amounted to million 
o casualties and insurance expense increased by  to  in from  in casualty loss expense in accounted for  of this increase since no casualty loss expense was incurred in o depreciation and amortization expense increased by  to million in from million in this increase is attributable to significant additions to property and equipment during and and to amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of connecticut central railroad company in april ii o net car hire expense increased by  from  in to  in this increase is attributable to the increase in inbound freight shipments experienced during the year but has been more than offset by demurrage revenues received from inbound freight customers 
other income other income increased million to million in from  in this increase is due primarily to an increase in gains from the sales of property and easements  principally million derived from the sale of fiber optics cable licenses
