item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout item i business  item properties  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  registrant has made forward looking statements regarding future developments in the cattle industry  in registrant s strategic alliances and the almond industry  registrant s plans for future plantings of permanent crops  future yields  prices and water availability for registrant s crops  future prices  production and demand for oil and other minerals  future development of registrant s property  future revenue and income of registrant s jointly owned travel plaza  potential losses to the company as a result of pending environmental proceedings and market value risks associated with investment and risk management activities and with respect to inventory  accounts receivable and registrant s own outstanding indebtedness 
these forward looking statements are subject to factors beyond the control of registrant such as weather and market and economic forces and  with respect to registrant s future development of its land  the availability of financing and the ability to obtain various governmental entitlements 
no assurance can be given that the actual future results will not differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
overview registrant intends to continue focusing on increasing revenues and improving net income by continuing to develop its significant land holding and by expanding its core business lines 
currently  registrant is working to take advantage of existing resources and market conditions as well as to anticipate and create future market trends and demand 
part of this effort includes evaluating registrant s land and water resources to ensure that the resources essential for growing the core businesses are available when and where needed 
in the future  registrant will continue to assess the feasibility of entering into complementary new related lines of business and refining or reconfiguring current core businesses to take advantage of opportunities presented and changing market conditions 
results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  net income was  in   in  and  in net income for declined when compared to due primarily to lower farming revenues and increased real estate expenses 
net income for increased when compared to due to increased sales within the livestock division and the real estate division 
changes in revenues and expenses of registrant s industry segments for years and are summarized below 
real estate 
real estate operating profits of  in are  less than operating profits 
this decrease in operating profits during was due to increases in staffing costs  professional service fees  increased depreciation costs  and losses related to the start up  training  opening  and first year operations of the petro travel plaza joint venture 
in addition to these increases in costs  revenues declined in comparison to due to the qwest easement sale proceeds of  payments from enron of  related to an option to lease  and a net increase in leasing income of  during being more than offset by the sale of land in for a gain of  the increases in staffing costs and professional service fees are directly related to the increased real estate development activities of registrant 
the increase in depreciation is primarily related to the purchase of four commercial office buildings during  which were purchased through a like kind property exchange to defer taxes on gains from the sale of land in activities at the petro travel plaza are very promising as sales of fuel continue to increase and restaurant and merchant transactions grow 
even though the first six months of operations of the petro travel plaza have shown losses due to some of the items mentioned above  the operations have begun to provide positive cash flows 
the expectations for are for continued growth of fuel sales as more and more travelers and trucking professionals become aware of the site and place petro on their refueling schedules 
in future years the real estate division will continue to see an increase in costs primarily related to professional service fees  planning costs  entitlement costs  and staffing costs as registrant continues to increase its real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as registrant develops its land holdings 
registrant will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for its land holdings 
future sales of land  as in  are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
registrant s goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  and residential programs 
see part i  item business commercial and land use for a further discussion of and future planning activities 
real estate net operating income of  in was  greater than net operating income 
this increase in net operating income during was due primarily to the sale of  acres of previously leased land to northrop grumman corp  which resulted in a gain of   net of tax 
in addition to the sale of land  real estate revenues increased approximately  due to increased lease revenues and the sale of land for a pipeline pump station 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by higher fixed water costs and the recording in of a one time payment of  related to the acquisition of easement rights by a pipeline company 
fixed water costs increased due to the cost of additional water entitlement and water banking charges 
livestock 
livestock operating profits of  in are an increase of  when compared to operating profits 
this increase in operating profits is primarily due to an increase in cattle sales revenues and the continuing profits of its feedlot operations 
cattle sales revenues increased approximately million during due to  additional head of cattle being sold during this increase in cattle sold is the result of registrant increasing its cattle herd throughout the last three years 
registrant s cattle herd at the end of was approximately  head compared to approximately  at the end of this increase in cattle sales revenues was partially offset by a corresponding increase in costs of sales on cattle sold of approximately million due to the increase in cattle sold 
the increase in combined livestock and feedlot revenues of million is due to the increase in cattle sales described above and to a decrease in revenues of million at registrant s feedlot in texas 
this significant reduction in feedlot revenues is primarily attributable to the fact that registrant elected to have a substantial number of its own cattle fed at the feedlot during  which resulted in a significant portion of the feedlot s revenues  when compared to  being eliminated as an intercompany transaction 
feedlot operations were also impacted  but to a lesser degree  by lower outside customer occupancy levels during the summer months and to lower prices charged to outside customers 
the decrease in revenues at the feedlot was more than offset by lower costs of sales due to lower prices for feed ingredients such as corn and milo when compared to the prior year 
overall for  registrant s feedlot produced million in net operating profits  which is comparable to the prior year 
registrant continued to use the futures and options markets to protect the future selling price of cattle and purchase prices of feed throughout without the ability to manage cattle and feed positions during  registrant s net operating income from livestock would have been  less due to the declines in cattle prices 
however  during  due to the increase in cattle prices throughout the last four months of the year  registrant recognized approximately  in losses on hedge positions 
registrant s goal in managing its cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allows registrant to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in managing cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap potential gains from the increase in price  and the risk in managing feed costs is that it can add additional costs for feed if grain prices fall dramatically 
cattle prices strengthened during late when compared to due primarily to increases in demand for beef products and the anticipation of lower future supplies of cattle 
this improvement in cattle prices may slow in the first quarter of as cattle feeders have placed additional cattle on feed in response to the improved market 
registrant believes that overall for  cattle prices should continue to improve due to increases in demand for product and to increased export demand because of the improving economies in asia 
livestock net operating profits of  in were  less than net operating income 
the decrease when compared to was primarily attributable to reduced cattle prices throughout that reduced the net margins on cattle sold 
net margins at champion feeders  registrant s feedlot  were also reduced due to increased feed inventory costs 
cattle sales revenue increased approximately  during due to  additional head of cattle being sold 
on a comparable basis with sales  the increase in cattle sales revenues was less than it should have been due to lower cattle prices throughout and the moving of sales scheduled for november and december to february to take advantage of improving market conditions 
revenues at the feedlot increased approximately  in when compared to due to owning champion feeders for the entire year of  increased average occupancy in the feedlot during july and august  and the sale of cattle as to which the feedlot was in partnership with customers of the feedlot 
champion feeders was purchased march  these increases in revenues were more than offset by an increase in the cost of sales on cattle sold and by increased feedlot expenses 
cost of sales of cattle increased primarily due to the increase in the number of cattle sold and to a slight increase in costs due to owning the cattle for longer periods of time 
feedlot expenses increased approximately  when compared to due to the timing of the purchase of the feedlot during  increased feed inventory costs and to cost of sales related to cattle sold as described above 
see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of registrant s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
farming operating profits of  in are  less than operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits is primarily due to reduced almond revenues  and reduced revenues from pistachios 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increased walnut revenues  and lower cultural costs 
the decrease in almond revenues during was due primarily to lower sales prices for almonds during the price of almonds declined approximately during when compared to the decline in prices was due to a record state wide crop for almonds 
registrant s production increased nearly million pounds when compared to due to improved weather conditions and to an increase in production from young almond orchards 
the significant increase in almond production across the state of california led the almond board of california to request an almond marketing reserve that was approved by the secretary of agriculture for approximately of the state s almond crop 
this means that only of registrant s almond crop can be sold until the almond marketing order is lifted 
the combination of lower prices  which also impacted payments received in related to the almond crop  and the impact of the almond marketing order resulted in almond revenues declining as shown above 
the decline in pistachio revenues during is due to a fall in production because of the alternate bearing cycle of pistachios 
the increase in walnut revenues is due to an increase in production that was partially offset by a reduction in walnut prices 
there was no significant variance in revenues related to grapes during as compared to due to production and pricing levels remaining constant between the years 
industry expectations are that statewide nut crop yields should continue to improve  which may negatively impact prices 
in addition  industry projections show a continuation of new almond and pistachio plantings that could also impact prices once full production begins 
within the grape industry there continues to be new land developed  which could begin to depress prices in the future once all new developments are in full production 
pricing pressure on grapes did begin during and due to increased production and is expected to continue through and possibly beyond 
registrant is currently in the last year of grape sales contracts and must renew the contracts during for due to pricing pressure on grapes this could be difficult 
if registrant has no grape contracts for and beyond  registrant will market its grapes to various wineries and the prices received will be driven more by the wineries expectations regarding demand for their products and grape production 
all of registrant s crops are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
for a further discussion of the farming year refer to part i  item business farming operations 
net operating income within the farming division in was  a decrease of  when compared to net operating income 
the decrease in net operating income was due to lower grape revenues  and pistachio revenues  and higher fixed water costs 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by higher almond revenues  an increase in farming lease payments  and lower cultural costs 
registrant s almond production increased despite poor weather during the spring  due primarily to the increase in production from newer almond plantings 
revenues from almonds also reflected higher prices than the prior year due to the lower statewide crop and a minimal inventory carryover from the prior year 
the combination of increased production and higher prices led to almond revenues increasing approximately in grape yields in declined when compared to  which caused grape revenues to decline when compared to pistachio production fell during due to weather related factors during the spring 
due to the reduction in yield  pistachio revenues fell when compared to walnut production increased during but revenues remained flat when compared to due to lower prices on walnuts 
walnut prices declined due to the high inventory levels at the beginning of resource management 
resource management operating profits of  during are  greater than operating profits 
the increase in operating profits during was due to an increase in oil and mineral royalties of  increased revenues from the game management program of  increased filming revenues of  and a reallocation of communication leasing revenues to resource management from the real estate division 
these favorable variances were partially offset by increased staffing costs and professional service costs 
mineral royalties increased due to the continued growth of construction in california which led to increased cement production and sand rock aggregate production 
registrant expects cement and sand rock aggregate royalties to remain strong over the next year due to the ongoing construction activity within california and to the cement manufacturing plant being renovated and production capacity being increased 
oil royalties increased during due to increasing prices for oil 
registrant expects oil and gas royalties to continue to be affected over the next few years by the fact that little or no new oil and gas exploration is taking place on registrant s lands 
other than possible increases in oil prices as occurred during  registrant expects oil royalties to be flat over the next year 
see part i  item business resource management  for a further discussion of activities and future expectations 
resource management operating profits of  in were  or below operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits during was due to lower revenues from oil and gas royalties  increased staffing costs and to increases in the costs related to the annual quarter horse events 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in revenues from the equestrian program 
interest 
interest income declined to  during from  in due primarily to a  reduction in average funds invested 
invested funds continued to decline during due to the growth of the cattle herd  capital expenditures  payment of dividends  and the financing of higher inventory balances 
interest income of  in fell  when compared to interest income 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and the continuing growth of registrant that resulted in a  decrease in funds invested 
invested funds declined due to the continued growth of the cattle herd  capital expenditures  payment of dividends and the financing of greater receivables and inventories 
interest expense paid in was  an increase of  when compared to interest expense 
the growth in interest cost is due to an increase in borrowings related to livestock operations and to increased real estate infrastructure costs 
total interest paid including capitalized interest in was  which was an increase of  over total interest continues to increase due to the funding of the growth in the cattle herd  infrastructure development and costs related to the development of the tejon industrial complex  to an increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of commercial buildings  and to the real estate planning and entitlement activities 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for a further description of short term and long term debt 
interest expense during was  an increase of  over interest expense in the increase in interest expense is due to the short term funding of the cattle inventory as well as funding the continuing growth in the cattle herd and to infrastructure and construction costs related to development at the tejon industrial complex 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses for were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase during is due to higher staffing costs  increased director and shareholder expense  and to increases in donations 
the increase in staffing costs  is due to increases in the accounting and mis departments  increased incentive compensation accruals  and increases in retirement plan costs 
higher director and shareholder expense  is primarily due to costs associated with the transfer of the trading of registrant s stock from the american stock exchange to the new york stock exchange 
donations increased approximately  primarily due to registrant committing to donate funds to help a local university build a new building for its business school 
corporate expenses during were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase in was due primarily to an increase in staffing costs 
this increase in staffing costs is tied primarily to a change in registrant s short term incentive compensation program 
partially offsetting this increase in staffing costs was a reduction in professional service fees 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on registrant s operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to registrant s farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received by registrant for many of its products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for registrant to accurately predict revenue  just as it cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
effective october   registrant adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas standardizes accounting for all derivative contracts and requires that all derivative contracts be reported in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives meeting certain specific requirements can be designated as hedges and the special accounting of sfas applied 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   registrant recognized losses of  related to sfas and recognized  in gains during related to sfas management has elected to not designate its futures and option contracts as hedges 
accordingly  during registrant reported a  net of tax of  resulting from the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
impact of year registrant completed all year remediation work prior to the end of total costs related to year work  including a new hardware and software conversion in  were approximately  as of this date registrant has had no year problems that have impacted its operations 
registrant also believes that any potential future problems related to year issues will be immaterial to its operations and anticipates no further costs related to this issue in the future 
financial condition 
registrant s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is approximately  less than working capital at the end of registrant has a revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of  bearing interest at the rate of  which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
at registrant s option the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or float at 
less than the bank s prime lending rate 
registrant s feedlot also has a short term revolving line of credit for the feedlot with a local bank for  with an outstanding balance at december  of  with an interest rate approximating the bank s prime lending rate of  which floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
the revolving lines of credit are used as short term cash management tools and for the financing of customer cattle and feed receivables at the feedlot 
the use of short term credit has grown due to increases in inventories as a result of the growth of registrant s core business lines and to the funding of infrastructure construction costs on a short term basis 
registrant s use of long term debt also increased  at the end of when compared to due to the purchase of three commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona and to a new long term line of credit that is used in funding longer term types of assets such as real estate development infrastructure on registrant s land and farming assets 
the three buildings that were purchased in phoenix  arizona and portions of registrant s farmlands secure these loans 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  expansion of the cattle herd  purchase of the cattle feedlot  purchase of land  purchases of commercial buildings  payments of long term debt  the payment of dividends and the financing of greater receivables and inventories 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows by registrant is made difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of registrant s products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
registrant  based on its past experience  believes it will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes nearly  for infrastructure at the tejon industrial complex and for real estate projects in los angeles county and the mountain lake area of registrant s land 
other items included in the capital expenditure budget are equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
funding of the above capital expenditures and ongoing operations during are expected to come from increased borrowing from banks  reimbursement of infrastructure costs related to the tejon industrial complex through bond proceeds from a local government agency  and from operating cash flows 
in future years  registrant expects that substantial investments will need to be made in its land assets to secure entitlements and begin development of the land 
in order to fund this growth  registrant will use various financing alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  increases in lines of credit with banks  sales of assets  possible elimination of the dividend  and or the issuance of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of registrant due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
registrant is exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks registrant is exposed to financial market risks  including changes to interest rate and credit risk related to marketable securities  interest rate related to its own outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of registrant s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields while prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  registrant limits its investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years to limit interest rate exposure and with an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors to minimize credit risk 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
registrant is exposed to interest rate exposure on its short term working capital line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the short term line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
a portion of the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate  and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the remaining long term debt  can either be fixed for periods of time to a libor rate or float with the lending bank s prime rate 
registrant typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its exposure on this debt through the use of any financial instrument derivatives 
registrant manages its interest rate exposure through negotiation of the terms 
registrant s credit and market risk related to its inventories and receivables ultimately depends on the value of the cattle  almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  registrant believes its credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following table provides information about registrant s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents the registrant s debt obligations  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity fair there value after total assets marketable securities        weighted average interest rate liabilities short term debt    weighted average interest rate long term debt         weighted average interest rate in comparison to the prior year  registrant s risks in regards to fluctuations in interest rates has remained fairly static overall due to comparable balances between years in short term debt that fluctuate with the lending bank s prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates in had the same effect under the terms of the debt instruments outstanding as they had in commodity price exposure registrant has exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories  gross margins  accounts receivable  and certain anticipated transactions in its livestock and farming divisions 
commodities such as corn and cattle are purchased and sold at market prices that are subject to volatility 
in order to manage the risk of market price fluctuations  registrant enters into various exchange traded futures and option contracts 
registrant closely monitors and manages its exposure to market price risk on a daily basis in accordance with formal policies established for this activity 
these policies limit the duration to maturity of contracts entered into as well as the level of exposure to be hedged 
registrant s goal in managing its cattle and feed costs is to protect or create a range of selling prices and feed prices that allow registrant to recognize a profit or minimize a loss on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
see note  commodity contracts used to manage risk of notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses on futures contracts and options as of december  were  as compared to the approximately  in gains at december  the change is primarily due to an increase in cattle prices during  which caused futures contracts and options to be repriced  creating losses on the derivative positions 
these losses will be offset by the increase in prices received on the sale of cattle 
inventories consist primarily of cattle for sale  and price fluctuations are managed with futures and options contracts 
see the table below for contracts outstanding at year end 
registrant is at risk with respect to changes in market prices with respect to cattle held for sale that are not protected by futures and options contracts 
at december  approximately of the cattle held in inventory or  head of cattle were not protected by futures and options for price movement 
this compares to  head of cattle at december  the number of head of cattle equates to approximately million pounds of beef 
for each 
per pound change in price  registrant has a potential exposure of  in future value 
although the price which the cattle will ultimately be sold is unknown  over the last three years the market price has ranged from 
per pound to 
per pound and the current market price at march  was 
per pound

these receivables are recorded at estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known until the third or fourth quarter of the following year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december   only  is at risk to changing prices 
of the amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios   to walnuts  and  to grapes 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds and  related to pistachios 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was 
per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds registrant s receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years the final prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  each 
change in the price increases or decreases the receivable by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been 
to 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was 
per pound 
for every 
change in the price of walnuts  registrant s receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from 
to 
over the last three years 
the prices used to estimate accounts receivable related to grapes is based on the variety of wine grape and the market for that grape 
at year end the average price used for recording the accounts receivable was per ton 
for every change in the price  registrant s receivables related to grapes can increase or decrease approximately  the average price for grapes has averaged between per ton to per ton over the last three years
