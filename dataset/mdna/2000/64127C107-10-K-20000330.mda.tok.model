amount msi s joint joint venture included in non jv consolidated venture sales net income co s msi revenue revenue revenue vs 
consolidated revenues increased in by only  however  the slight change included a million or increase in net sales offset by a million or decrease in equity earnings of joint ventures 
the increase in net sales consisted primarily of an increase in sales from gme of million and tbs of million  largely offset by a decrease in the sales of the company s remaining us  canadian and foreign joint venture explosives operations of million 
most of the million decrease in equity earnings of joint ventures was attributable to a decrease in cyanco s earnings  with the remainder of the decrease resulting from the decrease in equity in the earnings of turon msi and cayman mining services limited cms 
expectations of increased net sales in were realized with the acquisition of gme and subsequently the establishment of tbs 
however  the company s plans to offset the expected loss of revenues from the completed dam project in california were delayed until several new projects in the company s western division come on line in the first half of revenues are also expected to increase at the company s packaged emulsion plant resulting from product improvements and the additional demand for the product by gme and tbs 
oda should commence commercial production in resulting in an increase of revenues from that wholly owned subsidiary 
the consolidation of a full year of tbs operations will also increase revenues in equity in earnings of joint ventures is also expected to increase in due to a planned increase in mine production by one of the primary customers of the company s colombian joint venture 
additionally  the company s joint venture in kovdor  russia is expected to begin commercial production by the end of the second quarter of cyanco s contribution to equity in earnings of joint ventures has decreased as volumes and prices for sodium cyanide fell in in response to the lowest gold prices in years 
although the company expects that low gold prices may cause further erosion of the average sales price for liquid sodium cyanide  cyanco s position as the area s low cost producer will allow it to increase volumes by capturing additional market share 
also  because of current gold market conditions  the company was able to negotiate the elimination of deferred royalty obligations resulting in an extraordinary gain of million  net of taxes 
consolidated income from operations decreased million from million in to million in the million decrease in consolidated income from operations is attributable to the decrease in equity in earnings of cyanco as explained above  combined with a net decrease in contribution from the company s explosives operations of million 
as a result of the completion of the dam project in california in the early part of  combined with decreased coal production by customers in canada and colombia  contribution from the company s western us and canadian explosives divisions and the company s colombian joint venture decreased by a total of million when comparing to as mentioned above  the inability of the company s joint venture in uzbekistan to purchase raw materials resulted in a decrease in production 
consequently  contribution from turon msi decreased  in as compared to in analyzing the results of the company s explosives operating units above  the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs were considered components of the direct contribution from those operating units 
however  for purposes of financial statement disclosure  general and administrative expenses for the company include the general and administrative expenses of gme and tbs  which represent million of the million increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to although intensified effort toward product improvement contributed to the increase in research and development costs  the establishment of a more resilient packaged emulsion product allowed the company to reduce losses from its west virginia plant by approximately  and strengthened expectations of realizing long term benefit from the research through increased revenues from packaged emulsions 
income from operations is expected to increase in as the expected increase in revenues materialize 
the company incurred interest expense of  versus  of interest income that the company earned in in  other income and expense includes the write off of million of the company s investments in west africa chemicals limited wac and turon msi of  and million  respectively  including a  note receivable from wac 
although the company expects to receive payment for raw materials and supplies it sells to its joint venture in uzbekistan  due to deteriorating conditions observed in the later part of the company now considers the probability of converting profits from turon msi into hard currency to be remote 
additionally  depressed gold prices and an over supply of explosives products in ghana have deterred wac in obtaining market share sufficient to sustain profitable operations in the long term and have combined to cause continuing losses 
accordingly  the company determined in the last quarter of that it was necessary to write off the respective investments 
future recognition of income or loss from these equity method joint ventures will occur as cash is either received or disbursed 
vs 
consolidated revenues increased million from million in to million in non jv revenues increased million  largely due to increased sales in the us and canada as well as the acquisition of gme  while equity in earnings from joint ventures decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in equity in earnings from cyanco 
income from operations decreased  in as compared to the decrease resulted primarily from the decrease in the company s equity in earnings of cyanco offset by million in net contribution from the company s explosives operations 
because certain tax benefits that had been carried forward to and utilized in were not available to offset taxable income in  the effective tax rate for the company increased from in to in  thus further decreasing net income from  in to  in liquidity and financial resources the company retains a strong financial position and was able to increase stockholders equity during in spite of difficult market conditions experienced in the mining industry 
the company s current ratio increased from to at the end of to to at the end of  due in part to the consolidation of tbs combined with the conversion of the company s primary line of credit to a long term financial instrument  which is reflective of the company s increased use of its line of credit to fund investments 
although net income was  lower in as compared to  net cash provided by operating activities was only  lower in than it was in due primarily to an increase in distributed earnings of cyanco to the company in the amount of  as stated above  in january and february of the company received us dollar payments of approximately  for raw material shipments previously made to turon msi 
however  the company has agreed to use approximately  of the cash received in granting credit for importing raw materials into uzbekistan to allow operations there to continue 
while the government has supported turon msi with conversion commitments for the new credit  such commitments are subject to adverse economic conditions in uzbekistan 
net cash used in investing activities decreased  from  in to  in however  cash used for the purchase of plant and equipment increased  primarily due to the consolidation of  of tbs assets and the construction of oda s accessories manufacturing facilities of  in september of the company entered into a credit agreement with a major us bank for a million credit facility with features that allow for borrowings for equipment of up to million and for letters of credit of up to million 
this new line of credit carries an interest rate of prime minus 
because this credit facility matures august   it has been classified as long term debt  which is the primary cause of the reduction in the company s current portion of long term debt of  from to tbs also had a  line of credit at an interest rate of prime plus which was fully utilized at december  and was paid off in january as of december   the company owed  on its lines of credit 
during  the company had utilized up to  of its lines of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  from  in to  in the consolidation of tbs accounted for  of the increase  while  of the increase resulted from the conversion of a facility construction loan to mortgage financing 
the remainder of the increase is largely attributable to the net increase in the company s line of credit facilities of  whereas operating cash flows were sufficient to fund such needs in prior years  during the company relied more heavily on its lines of credit to finance working capital requirements and asset purchases  as contemplated in the structure of the credit agreement entered into by the company in september in management s opinion  the capital resources of the company are adequate to finance its business activity in the ordinary course of business assuming that the political  financial  and economic environment continue favorable to the mining industry at large 
however  the company anticipates being oriented toward investment in the current industry consolidation and therefore may need to obtain additional capital resources to fund such an investment strategy 
because of inflation associated with the economies of underdeveloped countries where the company invests  there exists a substantial risk that the value of investments in those jurisdictions may continue to erode 
additionally  as has been the case with the company s investment in uzbekistan  the internal balance of payment and capital shortages in some of those countries may limit the ability to convert local currencies into hard currency necessary for importing raw materials or remitting profits 
management intends to use appropriate transfer pricing  investments in hedges  loans and other credit facilities where practical and available to minimize the risks inherent in doing business in these countries 
the company continues to pursue its policy of investing with government entities or stable international and us companies as its partners to help insure its long term success 
to date  the company has not utilized any hedging activities to minimize exchange risks 
inflation and other comments the amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on the company s operations or its financial position 
amounts shown for property  plant and equipment and for costs and expenses reflect historical cost and do not necessarily represent replacement cost or charges to operations based on replacement cost 
the company s operations  together with other sources  are intended to provide funds to replace property  plant and equipment as necessary 
net income would be lower than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments 
within this annual report filed on form k  including this item  there are forward looking statements made in an effort to inform the reader of factors and results which  in management s opinion  are likely to have an ongoing material effect on the company 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in world supply and demand for commodities  political  environmental  economic and financial risks  especially those associated with underdeveloped and developing countries  changes in demand for construction activities  major changes in technology which could affect the mining industry as a whole or which could affect explosives and sodium cyanide specifically  competition  the continued availability of highly qualified technical and other professional employees of the company who can successfully manage the ongoing change and growth 
the company believes it is taking appropriate actions in order to address these and other factors previously disclosed  however  the actual results could materially differ from those indicated in the statements made 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency and interest rates 
the company manufactures and sells some of its products in colombia  ghana  uzbekistan and canada 
it also purchases products for raw materials and for resale from additional foreign markets such as australia and india 
in addition  the company licenses its technology in other foreign countries such as south africa  india  korea  and namibia 
approximately of the company s consolidated revenue is generated from foreign markets  however  as explained in the management s discussion and analysis of operation  the company s sales in joint ventures are not reported in consolidated revenues and the percentage of the company s business in foreign countries will likely remain significant 
the company manages its risk of foreign currency rate changes by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which it regularly transacts business and by maintaining hard currency accounts to which dollar denominated contracts are credited 
most of the sales and purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars except in ghana and uzbekistan where the investments have now been written off 
none of the license royalty payment obligations are denominated in us dollars and are thus subject to the risks of currency rate changes 
all excess cash balances are immediately transferred to us dollar accounts to the extent possible 
option contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions are not used by the company 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading in speculative purposes 
changes in the currency rate are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations currently 
however  once the company s joint venture in kovdor begins operations  sales contracts will be paid in local currency  though pegged to a dollar denominated price 
it is likely that sales receipts and leasing contract receipts may be subject to significant time delay in converting them from local currency to us dollars 
accordingly  equity in earnings from that joint venture may be subjected to more currency exchange risk than is experienced by the company in other foreign joint ventures 
it is not expected that currency rate hedging transactions will be used in the company s cash equivalents and short term investments and its outstanding debt bear variable interest rates 
the rates are adjusted to market conditions 
changes in the market rate effects interest earned and paid by the company 
the company does not use derivative instruments to offset the exposure to changes in interest rates 
changes in the interest rates are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations
