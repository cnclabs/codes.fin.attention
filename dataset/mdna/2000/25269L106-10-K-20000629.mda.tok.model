overview we are an e business services firm that synthesizes business and industry insight with technology expertise to create innovative digital strategies for leading national and multinational businesses 
once conceived  we believe such strategies must be implemented rapidly in order to maximize competitive benefits 
we have experienced substantial revenue growth since our inception  generating net revenues of million from clients during the fiscal year ended march  we employed client serving professionals as of march  our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients which are billed either monthly or semi monthly in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
out of pocket expenses are reimbursed by our clients and offset against expenses incurred and are not included in recognized revenues 
provisions are made for estimated uncollectible amounts based on our experience 
although from time to time we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables  to date none of such revisions has had a material adverse effect on our operating or financial results 
the largest portion of our costs consist primarily of employee related expenses for our client serving professionals and other direct costs  such as third party vendor costs and unbilled travel costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the remainder of our costs are comprised of the expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with our development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations  finance  information systems  facilities and other administrative support for project personnel 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
because most of our client engagements are  and may be in the future  terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments
