item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following table sets forth certain information relating to the growth in the number of orthodontic centers for the periods shown year ended december  centers at beginning of period centers developed during period centers acquired during period centers consolidated during period centers at end of period of the orthodontic centers at december   were developed by the company  were existing orthodontic practices the assets of which were acquired by the company and were consolidated 
the company expects that future growth in orthodontic centers will come from both developing orthodontic centers with existing and newly recruited affiliated orthodontists and acquiring the assets of  and affiliating with  existing orthodontic practices 
generally  when the company develops a new orthodontic center  all patients treated at the orthodontic center are new patients and  in the first several months after commencing operations  the orthodontic center is open only for a limited number of days each month as new patients are added 
the orthodontic centers have generally become increasingly more productive and profitable as more new patients are added and existing patients return for monthly follow up visits 
after months of operations  the orthodontic center s growth in patient base has typically begun to stabilize as the initial patients complete treatment 
at december   of the orthodontic centers had operated for less than months 
an orthodontic center can increase the number of patients treated by improving the efficiency of its clinical staff and by adding operating days or orthodontists 
the orthodontic centers may also increase revenue by implementing periodic price increases 
established practices whose assets were acquired by the company have typically increased their revenue by applying the company s operating strategies and systems  including increased advertising and efficient patient scheduling 
the company earns its revenue from long term service or consulting agreements entered into with affiliated orthodontists 
pursuant to the service agreements  during each month during the term of the service agreement  the company earns a fee equal to approximately of the aggregate amount of all new patient contracts entered into during that particular month  plus the aggregate of the allocated monthly balance amount of all patient contracts entered into in prior months  less amounts retained by the affiliated orthodontists 
the remaining contract balances are allocated equally over the remaining months during the terms of the patient contracts  which average months 
since  approximately of the company s annual net revenue has been uncollectible 
the amounts retained by an affiliated orthodontist are dependent on his or her financial performance  based in significant part on the profitability of the practice on a cash basis 
amounts retained by an affiliated orthodontist who operates a newly developed orthodontic center are typically reduced by operating losses on a cash basis because of start up expenses 
an affiliated orthodontist s share of these operating losses is added to the company s fee in the period during which the operating losses are incurred  with such fees aggregating approximately million during in addition  a  annual fee is earned by the company with respect to orthodontic centers 
the terms of consulting agreements vary depending upon the regulatory requirements of the particular state in which an orthodontic center is located  and generally differ significantly from the terms of service agreements 
in a limited number of states  the company may only provide consulting services to orthodontists and may not manage an orthodontist s practice 
the consulting fee payable to the company is determined at the time of affiliation  is generally limited to compensation for the specific consulting services performed and is generally based on criteria such as the number of hours of operations of the applicable orthodontic centers 
the company develops and manages the business and marketing aspects of orthodontic centers  including implementing advertising and marketing programs  preparing budgets  providing staff  purchasing inventory  providing patient scheduling systems  billing and collecting fees  maintaining records and providing office space and equipment 
operating expenses of the orthodontic centers are expenses of the company and are recognized as incurred 
employee costs consist of wages  salaries and benefits paid to all employees of the company  including orthodontic assistants  business staff and management personnel 
general and administrative expenses consist of provision for losses of patient contracts and receivables  professional service fees  maintenance and utility costs  office supply expense  telephone expense  taxes  license fees  and printing and shipping expense 
patient contracts are for terms averaging months and are payable in equal monthly installments throughout the term of treatment  except for the last month when a final payment is made 
during the first quarter of  the orthodontic centers generally implemented a fee increase from per month to per month  with an increase in the final payment from to during the first quarter of  approximately of the orthodontic centers implemented a fee increase  consisting of no down payment  equal monthly payments of per month over the term of treatment and a final payment of results of operation the following table sets forth the percentages of net revenue represented by certain items in the company s condensed consolidated statements of income

in thousands net revenue         operating profit         seasonality the orthodontic centers have experienced their highest volume of new cases in the summer and certain other periods when schools are not typically in session 
during these periods  children have a greater opportunity to visit an orthodontist to commence treatment 
consequently  the orthodontic centers have experienced higher revenue during the first and third quarters of the year as a result of increased patient starts 
during the thanksgiving and christmas seasons  the orthodontic centers have experienced reduced volume and fourth quarter revenue for the orthodontic centers has been generally lower as compared to other periods 
seasonality in recent periods has been mitigated by the impact of additional orthodontic centers 
liquidity and capital resources development and acquisition costs  capital expenditures and working capital needs have been  and will continue to be  financed through a combination of cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and the issuance of notes and shares of common stock 
the company intends to continue to lease  rather than purchase  facilities for the orthodontic centers  to maximize the company s available capital 
net cash provided by operations for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
from to  unbilled patient receivables net of prepayments increased million 
additionally  due to a change of income tax payment methods  cash paid for income taxes during exceeded the provision by million

unbilled patient receivables which represent patient revenue earned under patient contracts in excess of the amount billed under such patient contracts increased from million at december  to million at december   with this increase consistent with the increase in the number of patient contracts and price of treatment during this period 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures consist primarily of the costs associated with the development of additional orthodontic centers 
the average cost of developing a new orthodontic center is approximately  including the cost of equipment  leasehold improvements  working capital and start up losses associated with the initial operations of the orthodontic center 
these costs are shared by the company and the particular affiliated orthodontist 
the company assists affiliated orthodontists in obtaining financing for their share of such costs through the company s primary lender 
the company provides the lender a guaranty of these loans 
at december   approximately million of such advances was outstanding 
the company intends to continue to make advances of approximately  to newly affiliated affiliated orthodontists during the first year of an orthodontic center s operations  which advances bear no interest and typically are repaid during the second year of the orthodontic center s operations 
the company intends to fund such advances and any continued financing through a combination of bank borrowings  cash from operations and the remaining net proceeds from the company s prior public offerings 
of the orthodontic centers at december   were acquired through the acquisition of the assets of  and the affiliation with  existing orthodontic practices 
during  the company entered into preliminary or final agreements to acquire the assets of  and affiliate with  existing orthodontic practices operating at locations and made payments to practices acquired in earlier periods at a cost of approximately million  consisting of an aggregate principal amount of million of promissory notes issued by the company and an aggregate of  shares of common stock  with the remainder of approximately million being paid in cash

the line of credit provides an aggregate of million for general working capital needs and expansion of the number of orthodontic centers  and bears interest at varying rates above the london interbank offering rate libor 
amounts borrowed under the line of credit are secured by a security interest in all of the company s assets  including its accounts receivable and equipment 
at december   approximately million of indebtedness was outstanding under the line of credit 
the company expects that future cash requirements will principally be for developing additional orthodontic centers  acquiring assets from and affiliating with additional affiliated orthodontists  capital expenditures  repayment of long term debt  payment of income taxes and general corporate purposes 
the company s cash needs could significantly change depending upon the company s ability to recruit orthodontists  find appropriate sites  enter into long term service or consulting agreements and acquire the assets of existing orthodontic practices 
management believes that the combination of funds available under the company s revolving line of credit and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated funding requirements for the next months 
year prior to january   the company conducted significant testing  planning and system upgrades to address potential malfunctions by computer systems and embedded computer chips related to calendar dates after december  the company has not experienced any material year disruptions or malfunctions  and has not been informed of any material year disruptions or malfunctions experienced by any of its significant vendors or customers  or by the municipal agencies that provide services to the company

risk factors our disclosure and analysis in this report contain some forward looking statements 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts or by the use of forward looking terminology  such as anticipate  estimate  expect  may  will and should 
these forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements in item business  item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s future growth  development and acquisition of additional orthodontic centers  affiliation with additional orthodontic practices  international expansion  new case starts  national advertising and branding  advancement of funds to affiliated orthodontists  continued leasing of orthodontic center facilities  ancillary services  funding of the company s expansion  operations and capital expenditures  year issues  and payment or nonpayment of dividends 
actual results could differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include failure to consummate proposed developments or acquisitions of orthodontic centers  changes in the company s operating or expansion strategies  the general economy of the united states and the specific markets in which the orthodontic centers are located or are proposed to be located  and the following additional risk factors 
from time to time  the company may identify additional factors in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in the company s press releases 
our growth strategy includes risks that could have an adverse effect on financial performance 
since we began operating in  we have expanded to managing orthodontic centers as of december  we expect to continue to add additional orthodontic centers 
our growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to identify and affiliate with a sufficient number of orthodontists to open new orthodontic centers or operate within our existing network of orthodontic centers in suitable markets and our ability to obtain good locations for orthodontic centers within those markets 
our growth will also be influenced by our ability to identify and affiliate with a sufficient number of existing orthodontic practices and to integrate these practices into our existing operations 
we may be unable to identify and recruit suitable orthodontists 
a shortage of available orthodontists with the skills we require would have a material adverse effect on our expansion opportunities 
our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our expansion strategy will also affect our growth 
further  if we experience difficulties in managing additional orthodontic practices effectively  recruitment and expansion will suffer 
finally  future government regulations may inhibit our continued growth 
there can be no assurance that our expansion strategy will continue to succeed or that we will not have to modify our expansion strategy 
governmental organizations extensively regulate orthodontists and us 
the orthodontic industry and orthodontic practices are regulated extensively at the state and federal levels 
we do not control the practice of orthodontics by our affiliated orthodontists  nor their compliance with legal requirements applicable to orthodontists and their practices 
many states prohibit us  as a non professional corporation  from practicing orthodontics 
in certain states  managing or operating an orthodontic office is included within the definition of practicing orthodontics 
many states also prohibit a non professional corporation from splitting professional fees with orthodontists  owning or controlling the assets of an orthodontic practice  employing orthodontists  maintaining an orthodontist s patient records or controlling the content of an orthodontist s advertising 
many states also prohibit orthodontists from paying any portion of fees received for orthodontic services in exchange for a patient referral 
in addition  many states impose limits on the tasks an orthodontist may delegate to other staff members 
these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state and are enforced by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
we cannot be sure that a review of our business relationships by courts or other regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations 
the regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing or future operations 
an affiliated orthodontist may successfully challenge the legality of our long term service and consulting agreements  or a court or regulatory authority may limit our ability to enforce provisions contained in such agreements 
the laws and regulations of certain states and countries in which we seek to expand may require us to change our contractual relationships with orthodontists in a manner that would restrict our operations in those states and countries or prevent us from acquiring the assets of orthodontists or managing their practices in those states and countries 
further  the laws and regulations of states and countries in which we currently maintain operations may change or be interpreted in the future to either restrict or adversely affect our relationships with orthodontists in those states and countries 
our financial success depends on our affiliated orthodontists 
we do not employ orthodontists or control the practices of our affiliated orthodontists 
we receive fees for services we provide to orthodontic practices under service and consulting agreements 
our long term agreements with affiliated orthodontists have terms ranging from to years  with most ranging from to years 
affiliated orthodontists may terminate such agreements for cause  which generally includes our material breach of the long term agreement 
our revenue is derived primarily from our service agreements with affiliated orthodontists 
our revenue is therefore dependent on revenue generated by our affiliated orthodontists  who are essential to our success 
changes in the healthcare industry  such as the growth of managed care organizations and provider networks  may result in lower compensation for the services of our affiliated orthodontists 
the loss of a substantial number of our agreements with affiliated orthodontists or a material loss of revenue by our affiliated orthodontists  for whatever reason  could materially and adversely affect our financial results and results of operations 
other orthodontists and dentists compete with our affiliated orthodontists  and other companies compete with us 
orthodontics is a highly competitive business in each market in which our orthodontic centers operate 
each affiliated orthodontist faces competition from other orthodontists and general dentists in the communities they serve 
many of these other orthodontists and general dentists have more established practices 
managing orthodontic practices is also a highly competitive business 
we compete with other companies with strategies similar to ours in developing and managing orthodontic practices throughout the united states 
competitors with greater access to financial resources may enter our markets and compete with us 
we may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
also  additional competition may make it more difficult for us to affiliate with additional orthodontists on terms that are favorable to us 
our financial success may be damaged by successful claims against our affiliated orthodontists 
we manage the practices of orthodontists who provide orthodontic services to the public and are exposed to the risk of professional liability and other claims 
such claims  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards 
such awards might exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
insurance against losses of this type can be expensive 
insurance rates vary from state to state 
we do not control the practice of orthodontics by our affiliated orthodontists or their compliance with the legal and other requirements applicable to orthodontists and their practices 
each affiliated orthodontist has undertaken  however  to comply with all applicable laws 
under our long term agreements with affiliated orthodontists  they must reimburse us for any damages we suffer arising out of claims against our affiliated orthodontists 
we maintain liability insurance coverage  and we are generally named as an additional insured party under the liability insurance policies required to be maintained by each of our affiliated orthodontists 
however  a successful malpractice claim against us or an affiliated orthodontist could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our financial results may suffer if we have recorded intangible assets that are not recoverable 
as a result of our acquisitions of assets or capital stock of  and affiliations with  affiliated orthodontists  we recorded intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of approximately million on our balance sheet at december  we cannot assure you that we will realize the value of these intangible assets 
we expect to engage in additional transactions that will result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and amortization expense 
part of the amortization generated by these intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes 
as a matter of policy  we evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of such intangible assets may no longer be recoverable 
accounting rules require that if some of the carrying amount of such intangibles is no longer recoverable  we must take an additional charge to our earnings 
although  as of december   we do not believe that our net unamortized balance of intangible assets acquired and anticipated to be acquired is impaired  any future determination that a significant impairment has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of unamortized intangible assets 
such a write off could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on retaining key personnel 
our success depends upon the continued active participation of our senior management  particularly our chairman of the board and co chief executive officer  dr 
gasper lazzara  jr  our co chief executive officer and president  bartholomew f 
palmisano  sr  our chief operating officer  michael c 
johnsen  and our chief financial officer  bartholomew f 
palmisano  jr 
the loss of the services of any of these officers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified managerial personnel 
our stock price may be adversely affected by the control by our principal stockholders 
at december   our co chief executive officers  dr 
lazzara and bartholomew f 
palmisano  sr  collectively controlled or owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result of their holdings  dr 
lazzara and mr 
palmisano together have a disproportionate ability to affect the election of the members of our board of directors and to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval 
they therefore have a disproportionate control over our affairs and management 
this concentration of ownership may limit the price that investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
this control may therefore adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions may prevent a change in our control 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may discourage a change in our control  even if a change in control is in the stockholders best interests 
for example  certain board actions require a supermajority vote rather than a simple majority vote 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to determine the preferences and rights of preferred stock which we may issue without any vote or approval of the holders of our common stock 
the rights of common stockholders will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future 
the issuance of such preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
through the issuance of preferred stock with certain powers  the board of directors may prevent changes in our management and control 
the board of directors is divided into three classes of directors 
directors from each class serve staggered three year terms  which may affect the ability of stockholders to replace a majority of the incumbent directors 
our stock price may fluctuate 
from time to time  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to variations in our financial results or announcements of material events or that of our competitors 
regulatory changes  developments in the healthcare and practice management industry  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us could also cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all financial instruments held by the company and described below are held for purposes other than trading 
interest rate risk 
the company s lines of credit and the advances for operating losses included in amounts due from orthodontic entities in the company s consolidated financial statements expose earnings to changes in short term interest rates since the interest rates on the financial instruments are variable 
for lines of credit  if i the variable rates on the company s financial instruments were to increase by from the rate at december   and ii the company borrowed the maximum amount available under its lines of credit million for all of  solely as a result of the increase in interest rates  the company s interest expense would increase  resulting in a  decrease in net income  assuming an effective tax rate of approximately for the company s advances to orthodontic entities for operating losses  if the i the variable rates on the company s advances were to decrease by from the rate at december   and ii advances were outstanding for all of  solely as a result of the decrease in interest rates  the company s interest income would decrease  resulting in a  decrease in net income  assuming an effective tax rate of approximately 
comparatively  if the interest rate had decreased as of december   the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately  assuming an effective tax of approximately 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
foreign exchange risk 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
management does not believe its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is material
