on october   the new agreement was amended to increase the minimum amount of lpg to be purchased during the period from november through march by million gallons resulting in a new annual minimum commitment of million gallons 
the new agreement  as amended  represents an increase of over annual minimum contract volumes under the previous sales agreement with pmi for the period april  through march  actual sales volumes to pmi during the period april  through march  exceeded the minimum contractual volumes by 
under the terms of the new agreement  sale prices are indexed to variable posted prices 
the new agreement also provides for higher fixed margins above the variable posted prices over the previous sales agreements with pmi depending on the final delivery point of the lpg 
sales to pmi totaled  for the year ended july   representing approximately of total revenues for the period

under the terms of the new agreement  in the event that the us mexico pipelines or railcars are not used  the sales price received shall be reduced by the corresponding trucking charges 
during april  the company began shipping lpg through the us mexico pipelines 
during october  approximately of the lpg sold to pmi was delivered through the us mexico pipelines to the matamoros terminal facility 
as of july   the saltillo terminal facility had not commenced operations 
as part of volume requirements under the new agreement  the company has committed to sell pmi million gallons of propane at a sales price of approximately per gallon  to be delivered during december and february historically  the company and pmi have renewed the existing sales agreement prior to its expiration 
the company intends to negotiate a renewal of the new agreement prior to its expiration 
lpg supply agreements 
during october  the company entered into a monthly supply agreement with exxon mobil corporation exxon pursuant to which exxon agreed to supply minimum volumes of lpg to the company 
effective november   the company entered into a supply agreement with exxon to purchase minimum monthly volumes of lpg through september effective october   the company and exxon entered into a ten year lpg supply contract  as amended the exxon supply contract  whereby exxon has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  of exxon s owned or controlled volume of propane and butane available at exxon s king ranch gas plant the plant up to million gallons per month blended in accordance with the specifications as outlined under the new agreement the plant commitment 
the purchase price is indexed to variable posted prices 
in addition  under the terms of the exxon supply contract  exxon made operational its corpus christi pipeline the eccpl during september the ability to utilize the eccpl allows the company to acquire an additional supply of propane from other propane suppliers located near corpus christi  texas the additional propane supply  and bring the additional propane supply to the plant the eccpl supply for blending to the proper specifications outlined under the new agreement and then delivered into the leased pipeline 
in connection with the eccpl supply  the company has agreed to supply a minimum of million gallons into the eccpl during the first quarter from the date that the eccpl is operational  approximately million gallons the following year and million gallons each year thereafter and continuing for four years 
the company is required to pay additional costs associated with the use of the eccpl 
in september  the company and pg e ngl marketing  lp pg e entered into a three year supply agreement the pg e supply agreement whereby pg e has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  a monthly average of million gallons of propane the pg e supply beginning in october the purchase price is indexed to variable posted prices 
under the terms of the pg e supply agreement  the pg e supply will be delivered to either the leased pipeline or  in the future  the eccpl after pg e completes construction of an interconnection  expected to be completed by december  and blended to the proper specifications as outlined under the new agreement 
in march  the company and koch hydrocarbon company koch entered into a three year supply agreement the koch supply contract whereby koch has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  a monthly average of million gallons the koch supply of propane beginning april   subject to the actual amounts of propane purchased by koch from the refinery owned by its affiliate  koch petroleum group  lp the purchase price is indexed to variable posted prices 
furthermore  the company is required to pay additional charges associated with the construction of a new pipeline interconnection to be paid through additional adjustments to the purchase price totaling approximately million which allows deliveries of the koch supply into the eccpl 
in connection with the delivery of the koch supply  the company did not accept the koch supply because the eccpl was not operational until september accordingly  the company arranged for the sale of the koch supply to third parties the unaccepted koch supply sales 
the company incurred additional costs in connection with the disposal of the unaccepted koch supply sales 
under the terms of the koch supply contract  the koch supply will be delivered into the eccpl and blended to the proper specifications as outlined under the new agreement 
during march  the company and duke energy ngl services  inc duke entered into a three year supply agreement the duke supply contract whereby duke has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  a monthly average of million gallons the duke supply of propane or propane butane mix  beginning april  the purchase price is indexed to variable posted prices 
pursuant to the terms of the duke supply contract  the company paid a minimal amount for modifications related to the interconnections necessary to allow the duke supply to be delivered into the pipeline facilities 
the delivery of the pg e supply or the koch supply will satisfy a portion or all of the eccpl supply requirements under the exxon supply contract 
the company is currently purchasing lpg from the above mentioned suppliers the suppliers to meet the minimum monthly volumes required in the new agreement 
the company s costs to purchase lpg less any applicable adjustments are below the sales prices provided for in the new agreement 
the agreements with the suppliers currently require that the company purchase a minimum supply of lpg  which is significantly higher than committed sales volumes under the new agreement 
the company may incur significant additional costs associated with the storage  disposal and or changes in lpg prices resulting from the excess of the plant commitment  pg e supply  koch supply or duke supply over actual sales volumes 
under the terms of the supply contracts  the company must provide letters of credit in amounts equal to the cost of the product to be purchased 
in addition  the cost of the product purchased is tied directly to overall market conditions 
as a result  the company s existing letter of credit facility may not be adequate to meet the letter of credit requirements under the agreements with the suppliers or other suppliers due to increases in costs of lpg or lpg volumes purchased by pmi 
upon the implementation of deregulation  the company anticipates entering into contracts with mexican distributors which require payments in pesos 
in addition  the mexican distributors may be limited in their ability to obtain adequate financing 
the ability of the company to increase sales of lpg into mexico in the future is largely dependent on the company s ability to negotiate future contracts with pmi and or with local mexican distributors once deregulation in mexico is implemented 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain terms equal to or more favorable to the terms as those in the new agreement 
in the event that the company is unable to meet its intended lpg sales objectives  then the company may incur significant losses 
furthermore  the company currently utilizes the brownsville terminal facility and may be required to deliver a portion or all of the minimum monthly volumes from the brownsville terminal facility in the future 
historically  sales of lpg from the brownsville terminal facility have not exceeded million gallons per month 
in addition  breakdowns along the planned distribution route for the lpg once purchased from the suppliers  may limit the ability of the company to accept or deliver the plant commitment  the eccpl supply  the pg e supply  the koch supply  and the duke supply 
as a result of the exxon supply contract  the pg e supply agreement  the koch supply contract and the duke supply contract  the company has an adequate supply of lpg to satisfy the requirements of pmi under the new agreement 
due to strategic location of the company s pipelines and terminal facilities  the company believes that it will be able to enter into future sales agreements to utilize the excess volumes committed to under the contracts with the suppliers
