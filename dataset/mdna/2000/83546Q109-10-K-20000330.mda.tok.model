when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements  which include statements concerning the timing of availability and functionality of products under development  product mix  trends in average selling prices  trends in the pc market  the percentage of export sales and sales to strategic customers and the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect our results  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of diamond 
diamond designs  develops  manufactures and markets multimedia and connectivity products for personal computers 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the results of operations of diamond and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in the company s consolidated financial statements as of september   the effective date of the purchase  through the end of the fiscal year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin loss operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and administrative other operating expense amortization of goodwill and intangibles related to the diamond acquisition total operating expenses loss from operations gain on sale of joint venture other income expense  net loss before income taxes and equity in income of manufacturing joint venture and minority interest in rioport benefit for income taxes loss before equity in income of manufacturing joint venture and minority interest in rioport equity in income from manufacturing joint venture minority interest in rioport net income loss net sales the company s net sales to date have been generated from the sale of its graphics and multimedia accelerators  connectivity products for the home and products for acquiring  managing and experiencing music and spoken audio programming from the internet 
the company s products are used in  and its business is dependent on  the personal computer industry and growth of the internet with sales primarily in the us  asia and europe 
net sales were million in  an increase of from million in net sales for consisted primarily of the company s d  d mobile  video accelerators  graphics accelerators  modem and home networking products 
sales increased from to because of the acquisition of diamond multimedia and the inclusion of the revenue of its products in the company s financial results of operations from september  through december  in addition  the company introduced products into new markets such as add in graphics cards and replaced older generation products with savage products in the desktop and laptop pc markets  resulting in an increased volume of product shipments and higher average selling prices 
sales decreased from to because of declining unit average selling prices due to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors  the sale of older generation products at lower prices  a significant decrease in unit volumes and the lack of products available at the high end of the market 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
due to competitive price pressures  the company s products experience declining unit average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
export sales accounted for  and of net sales in  and respectively 
approximately of export sales in were to affiliates of united states customers 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurances that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
three customers accounted for  and of net sales in three customers accounted for  and of net sales in three customers accounted for  and of net sales in the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
sales to original equipment manufacturers oems were significant to the company s net sales in sales to the three largest oem customers accounted for of net revenue in gross margin the company had a gross margin percentage of in  a negative gross margin percentage of in and a gross margin percentage of in the gross margin in was favorably impacted by an increase in average selling prices and an increase in sales of products with higher margins  partially offset by charges for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market reserves compared to the negative gross margin in was a result of decreases in overall average selling prices of the virge and trio family of accelerators 
also affecting the negative gross margin were charges for excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market reserves established for the company s d and d products  a million charge for underutilized prepaid production capacity and yield losses 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in the unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold  the extent to which the company forfeits or utilizes its production capacity rights with tsmc  the extent to which the company will incur additional licensing fees and shifts in sales mix between add in card and motherboard manufacturers and systems oems 
research and development expenses the company has made and intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses decreased by from to as a result of an increased focus on core technology and products 
concentration of research and development efforts resulted in lower headcount and related costs 
write offs of idle and excess capital equipment in resulted in lower depreciation and maintenance charges in research and development expenses for reflect approximately million in charges for the company s discontinued audio and communications product lines and the write offs of idle  excess and obsolete capital equipment associated with research and development projects terminated during the year 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses decreased from to as a result of reductions in engineering staff due to discontinuing certain product lines during the year 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses from to is due primarily to the acquisition of diamond and additional sales  marketing and administrative expenses required to support the increase in revenue from to as a percentage of revenue  selling  marketing and administrative expenses decreased from in to in selling  marketing and administrative headcount decreased by and commission expense decreased by approximately million from to  accounting for the decrease in sales  marketing and administrative expense from to other operating expense other operating expense in includes a write off of acquired technologies of million related to the purchase of diamond on september  this was determined through valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry and was immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
the charge is discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
other operating expense in includes a write off of acquired technologies of million  a charge for impairment of long lived assets of million and a restructuring charge of million 
in january  the company entered into a million technology exchange with cirrus logic  inc to obtain graphic functionality technologies 
as a result of the exchange  the company acquired the technology covered by graphic patents and graphic patent applications  as well as cross licensed cirrus logic s remaining patents 
under the terms of the cross licensing provisions  the company and cirrus logic have a perpetual license to each other s graphic patents and additional licenses with respect to the other party s patents for agreed upon periods of time 
the company wrote off million of the value of the acquired technologies that were not realizable based on estimated cash flows from the sale of products currently sold by the company 
the remaining million intangible asset was being amortized to cost of sales based on the estimated lives of the currently utilized core technologies  which was generally five years 
however  during the fourth quarter of  management reevaluated the carrying value of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the technology exchange with cirrus logic  inc  and related to the patents obtained from brooktree  as well as other long lived assets  including property and equipment 
this revaluation was necessitated by management s determination based on recent results of operations that the future expected sales and cash flows for the company s operations would be substantially lower than had been previously expected by management 
expected undiscounted future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss of million  representing the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the assets  was recognized for write downs of a substantial portion of the intangible assets 
the estimated fair value of the intangible assets was based on management s best estimate of the patent portfolio based on a comparison to other graphics technology portfolios in the marketplace 
the company determined that no write down of property and equipment was necessary at december  based on its estimate of the fair value of such assets 
due to technological changes in the graphics marketplace  the company concluded it should accelerate its amortization of its remaining patent portfolio  of approximately million  over the current estimated life of the currently utilized core technologies  which is two years 
in july  the company implemented a restructuring plan in order to align resources with a new business model and to lower the company s overall cost structure 
in connection with the restructuring  the company reduced its headcount and consolidated facilities 
severance and related benefits represented the reduction of approximately employees 
all severance packages were paid by the end of the second quarter of the number of temporary employees and contractors used by the company was also reduced 
the restructuring expense included the write off and write down in carrying value of equipment  which consists primarily of workstations  personal computers and furniture  that will no longer be utilized in the company s operations 
these assets were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 
facility closure expenses were incurred as a result of the company vacating one of two leased buildings at the company s headquarters facility and include leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and network costs 
the company completed its move in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off approximately million of intangible assets including certain licenses  patents and other technology  as a result of management s decision to focus attention on the core graphics business 
as a result of this decision  no future cash flows were expected related to these assets 
gain on sale of manufacturing joint venture on december   the company entered into an agreement with umc to sell to umc million shares of stock of usc for a purchase price of billion new taiwan dollars 
the company received the purchase price approximately million in cash in january upon closing 
the gain on the sale of stock in usc recorded in was million 
in june  the company amended its agreements with umc 
under the terms of the amended agreements  umc has agreed to pay the company  subject to certain conditions  billion new taiwan dollars approximately million in cash and the company has agreed to release umc from contingencies associated with the sale of million shares of stock of usc in january and to grant a license to patents covering multimedia products and integrated circuit manufacturing technology for use in products manufactured by umc 
payments are being received over five fiscal quarters beginning in the quarter ended june  in  the gain on the sale of stock in usc was million 
other income expense  net other expense  net decreased in to million from million in the decrease was due primarily to non recurring write offs of certain equity investments and royalty expenses that occurred in and an increase in sublease income in  partially offset by an increase in interest expense and a decrease in interest income 
other expense  net  increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of write offs of certain equity investments in technology companies 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to the benefit tax rates of and for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for reflects the expected benefits of current year and prior year net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
the effective tax rate for reflects the expected benefits of current year loss carrybacks net of the establishment of a valuation allowance in against the beginning of the year balance of net deferred tax assets 
the tax rate reflects the full benefit of operating losses at statutory rates plus the benefit of tax credits generated 
liquidity and capital resources cash used for operating activities was million in and consisted primarily of the company s operating loss of million  an increase in deferred income taxes of million and an increase in inventories of million 
these were partially offset by non cash charges including depreciation  amortization and write off of acquired technologies and by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other and increases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes payable 
cash used for operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the company s operating loss of million was offset by non cash charges including deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  loss on the disposal of equipment  write off of prepaid production capacity  the utilization of production capacity rights  write off of impaired assets and the write off of acquired technologies 
the company sold a portion of its interest in usc during and recognized a gain of million 
in addition the company recognized million in income from their equity investment in usc 
the non cash charges were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of lower net sales by the company while inventories decreased as the result of lower production volumes and charges taken during for excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market reserves and yield losses 
accounts payable decreased as a direct result of lower inventory purchases 
investing activities provided cash of million in and consisted primarily of maturities of short term investments of million  cash received from umc related to the sale of shares of million and cash received from the sale of investment in real estate partnership of million  offset by purchases of short term investments of million  the acquisition of diamond  net of cash acquired of million and net purchases of property and equipment of million 
investing activities used cash of million in and consisted primarily of million used in a patent purchase and cross licensing agreement with cirrus logic  inc  million of property and equipment purchases  million of short term investment purchases  offset by million of maturities of short term investments and million from the sale of a portion of the company s joint venture in usc 
investing activities used cash of million in and consisted primarily of million of property and equipment purchases  million of short term investment purchases  offset by million of maturities of short term investments 
the company expects capital requirements for to be consistent with those for financing activities provided cash of million in and consisted of sales of common stock  net  including million received from the sale of stock to three foreign investors  and the sale of a warrant to intel  offset partially by repayments of notes payable 
financing activities used cash of million in and consisted primarily of repayments of notes payable and equipment financing  offset partially by sales of common stock  net 
financing activities provided cash of million in and consisted primarily of the sales of common stock pursuant to employee stock option and stock purchase plans and million in borrowings on notes payable 
this million source of funds in was repaid in in  the company entered into two long term manufacturing capacity arrangements 
the company entered into an agreement with umc and alliance semiconductor corporation to form usc  a separate taiwanese company  for the purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan  republic of china 
the company invested million in and million in for its equity interest 
in january  the company reduced its equity interest to through the sale of a portion of its usc shares  and received approximately million in cash 
the facility commenced production utilizing advanced submicron semiconductor manufacturing processes in late in january  the company s usc shares were exchanged for million umc shares 
the company has the right to purchase up to of the output from the foundry 
in addition  the company expanded and formalized its relationship with tsmc to provide additional capacity over the to timeframe 
during the second quarter of  the company and tsmc agreed to extend the capacity term of the agreement two years to the agreement with tsmc requires the company to make certain annual advance payments to be applied against the following year s capacity 
the company has signed promissory notes to secure these payments  which total million as of december  with the final payment due in working capital at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
at december   the company had short term lines of credit and bank credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was unused and available 
as of december   the company was in default with its loan covenants regarding liquidity 
the company obtained a waiver for this violation 
the company believes that its available funds will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  other than expenditures for future potential manufacturing agreements 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  equity investments in  advances or issuances of equity securities to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct wafer fabrication facilities 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technology or products that complement the business of the company 
the company is currently a party to certain legal proceedings 
litigation could result in substantial expense to the company 
see item legal proceedings 
year compliance in prior years  the company discussed in detail the nature and progress of its plans for year compliance 
in late  the company completed the assessment  remediation  testing and contingency plans for its computer systems to address the year issue 
the company believes that the costs for remediation  testing and implementation expensed in did not exceed million 
the company believes that its products do not require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company believes that its products will not expose it to material year related liability 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products or services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year issues that may arise are addressed promptly 
factors that may affect our results the expected benefits of our merger with diamond multimedia may not be realized 
if that happens  our operating results may suffer 
we merged with diamond multimedia in september expecting that the merger between the two companies would result in benefits to us including faster time to market with new products and increased cost efficiencies 
we will not realize the full benefits of the merger if we do not effectively integrate diamond s technologies  operations and personnel with ours in a timely and efficient manner 
the difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating diamond  which may be substantial  may include distracting management and other key personnel  particularly senior engineers involved in product development and product definition  from focusing on our business  perceived and potential adverse changes in business focus or product offerings  potential incompatibility of business cultures  costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures  particularly in integrating different information systems  and inability to retain and integrate key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel 
if we do not timely and efficiently integrate our technologies  operations and personnel  our operating results may suffer 
as a result of the merger  we expect that some of our customers may not do business with us  which could cause a decline in our sales 
the consummation of the merger is expected to cause some of our add in card and motherboard customers to end or curtail their relationships with us 
the loss of these customers could cause a decline our sales unless new sales resulting from the integration of diamond have an offsetting effect 
for example  creative technology ltd  a competitor of diamond and previously an s customer  has discontinued its relationship with us 
additional customers may discontinue their relationships with us in the future 
this may occur because our products comprise of both graphics chips and graphics boards 
thus  as a result of the merger  we are competing with those of our current customers  which are graphics board manufacturers 
as a result  we expect that sales to some of our existing customers will be reduced significantly from prior levels and that these customers will no longer continue to be significant customers 
unless we are able to offset the loss of these sales with new customers or sales of alternative products  our revenues may decline 
we are dependent on a limited source of graphics chips and graphics boards because s and diamond are each suppliers to each other  resulting in heightened risks because one company s suppliers may not meet the other company s requirements 
as a result of the merger with diamond  we have become significantly dependent on our graphics chip design and development capabilities and significantly dependent on diamond s graphics board design  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
this occurred because we are now more restricted in our ability to select and use products produced by our competitors prior to the merger 
if either our graphics chips or diamond s graphics boards fail to meet the requirements of the market and our customers  our relationship with those customers could be hurt  negatively affecting our financial performance 
in addition  we will be highly dependent on our ability to provide graphics chips on a timely basis meeting the rigid scheduling and product specification requirements of oems 
if our graphics chips are not competitive or not provided on a timely basis  we will most likely not be able to readily obtain suitable alternative graphics chips  which would result in our loss of revenue and customers 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  which could result in failing to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations resulting in a drop in the price of our common stock 
our annual and quarterly results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
the failure to meet market expectations could cause a drop in our stock price 
these factors include the industry in which we compete is always changing with the constant introduction of new technologies  products and methods of doing business  our ability to develop  introduce and market successfully new or enhanced products  our ability to introduce and market products in accordance with specialized customer design requirements and short design cycles  changes in the relative volume of sales of various products with sometimes significantly different margins  changes in demand for our products and our customers products  rapid changes in electronic commerce on which we or our customers may not capitalize or which erode our traditional business base  frequent gains or losses of significant customers or strategic relationships  unpredictable volume and timing of customer orders  the availability  pricing and timeliness of delivery of components for our products  the availability of wafer capacity using advanced process technologies  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us or by our competitors  product obsolescence and the management of product transitions  production delays  decreases in the average selling prices of products  seasonal fluctuations in sales  and general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia and europe in particular  that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling 
some or all of these factors could adversely affect demand for our products and our future operating results 
most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to rapidly adjust spending to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could harm our quarterly operating results 
because the lead times of firm orders are typically short in the graphics industry  we do not have the ability to predict future operating results with any certainty 
therefore  sudden changes that are outside our control  such as general economic conditions  the actions or inaction of competitors  customers  third party vendors of operating systems software  and independent software application vendors  may materially and adversely affect our performance 
we generally ship more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with levels of shipment in the third month higher towards the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor and multimedia communication industries  is likely to continue and makes future quarterly operating results less predictable 
as a result of the above factors  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of future performance 
we experienced a net loss for the last two years and we may continue to experience net losses in the future 
we had a net loss of million for and a net loss of million for these results occurred primarily because we did not offer competitive products in the high end of the graphics and multimedia accelerator market 
in addition  revenues from graphics accelerators declined in part due to continued reductions in demand for entertainment specific products 
in particular  diamond is no longer building and selling high performance d only products 
in addition  demand and pricing for graphics accelerators that combine d and d display and are targeted specifically for game enthusiasts declined 
further  revenue for low end graphic accelerators continued to decline significantly as more of these market requirements were met by the direct installation of graphics chips onto pc motherboards 
as a result  our sales consisted of primarily older generation and lower price products that were sold into markets that had significant price competition 
to the extent that we continue to experience net losses in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
if we do not continue to develop and market new and enhanced products  we will not be able to compete successfully in our markets 
the markets for which our products are designed are intensely competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
as a result  we cannot succeed unless we consistently develop and market new products 
we believe this will require expenditures for research and development in the future consistent with our historical research and development expenditures 
to succeed in this environment  we must anticipate the features and functionality that customers will demand 
we must then incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the design  performance  quality and pricing requirements of the personal computer market and the timing requirements of pc oems and retail selling seasons 
for example  we have a joint venture with via technologies to bring integrated graphics and core logic chip sets to the oem desktop and notebook pc markets 
there can be no assurance that the joint venture will be successful or that our existing products will be compatible with new products 
we have in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products  as well as compatibility issued with integrated products and we cannot assure you that we will not experience similar delays in the future 
in the past  our business has been seriously harmed when we developed products that failed to achieve significant market acceptance and therefore were unable to compete successfully in our markets 
such a failure could occur again in the future 
the demand for our products has historically been weaker in certain quarters 
due to industry seasonality  demand for pcs and pc related products is strongest during the fourth quarter of each year and is generally slower in the period from april through august 
this seasonality may become more pronounced and material in the future to the extent that a greater proportion of our sales consist of sales into the retail mass merchant channel  pcs become more consumer oriented or entertainment driven products  or our net revenue becomes increasingly based on entertainment related products 
also  to the extent we expand our european sales  we may experience relatively weak demand in third calendar quarters due to historically weak summer sales in europe 
we operate in markets that are intensely and increasingly competitive 
the personal computer multimedia and communications markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are likely to become more competitive in the future 
because of this competition  we face a constant and increasing risk of losing customers to our competitors 
the competitive environment also creates downward pressure on prices and requires higher spending to address the competition  both of which tend to keep profit margins lower 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for our products are product performance and quality  conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces  or apis  access to customers and distribution channels  reputation for quality and strength of brand  manufacturing capabilities and cost of manufacturing  price  product support  and ability to bring new products to the market in a timely manner 
historically  the gross profit margins on diamond s products have been lower than the margins on our products 
as a result of the merger  our average gross margins will likely be lower than they were prior to the merger thereby decreasing our average gross margins 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources 
these competitors may also have greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  greater market power and product breadth  lower cost structures and larger customer bases 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of our principal competitors offer a single vendor solution because they maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
in some markets where we are a relatively new entrant  such as modems  home networking  sound cards and consumer electronics  including internet music players  we face dominant competitors that include com home networking and modems  creative technologies sound cards  modems and internet music players  intel home networking and sony consumer electronic music players 
in addition  the markets in which we compete are expected to become increasingly competitive as pc products support increasingly more robust multimedia functions and companies that previously supplied products providing distinct functions for example  companies today primarily in the sound  modem  microprocessor or motherboard markets emerge as competitors across broader or more integrated product categories 
in addition to graphics board manufacturers  our competitors include oems that internally produce graphics chips or integrate graphics chips on the main computer processing board of their personal computers  commonly known as the motherboard  and makers of other personal computer components and software that are increasingly providing graphics or video processing capabilities 
our entry into new product markets could divert resources from our core business and expose us to risks inherent in new markets 
our business historically has focused primarily on the design  manufacture and sale of graphics chips 
however  we are now  from time to time  undertaking new product initiatives  such as the rio line of digital music players  the homefree family of home networking products market and our web pad 
there are numerous risks inherent in entering into new product markets 
these risks include the reallocation of limited management  engineering and capital resources to unproven product ventures  a greater likelihood of encountering technical problems and delays  and a greater likelihood that our new products will not gain market acceptance 
the failure of one or more of such products could negatively impact our financial results 
adverse effects of new products may also injure our reputation in our core business and also could negatively impact our financial results 
we operate in the personal computer and graphics and video chip markets  which are rapidly changing  highly cyclical and vulnerable to sharp declines in demand and average selling prices 
we operate in the personal computer and graphics video chip markets 
these markets are constantly and rapidly changing and have in the past  and may in the future  experience significant downturns 
these downturns are characterized by lower product demand and accelerated product price reductions 
in the event of a downturn  we would likely experience significantly reduced demand for our products 
substantially all of our revenues are currently derived from products sold for use in or with personal computers 
in the near term  we expect to continue to derive almost all of our revenues from the sale of products for use in or with personal computers 
changes in demand in the personal computer and graphics video chip markets could be large and sudden 
since graphics board and personal computer manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecasted product transitions 
in such cases  the manufacturers may abruptly stop purchasing additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been used 
this suspension of purchases or any reduction in demand for personal computers generally  or for particular products that incorporate our products  would negatively impact our revenues and financial results 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in results of operations due to these general semiconductor industry conditions 
we have only recently started to offer products intended to address all performance segments of the commercial and consumer pc market 
we recently commenced shipments of our savage product  which is designed to compete in multiple performance segments of the commercial and consumer pc markets and to satisfy multiple function market needs  such as graphics  video and dvd support 
we do not know whether savage will be able to compete successfully in those segments 
if we are not able to introduce and successfully market higher performance products  our gross margin and profitability could be negatively affected 
demand for our products may decrease if the same capabilities provided by our products become available in operating systems or embedded in other personal computer components 
a majority of our net sales are derived from the sale of graphics boards and multimedia accelerators for pc subsystems 
however  there is a trend within the industry for lower performance graphics and video functionality to migrate from the graphics board to other personal computer components or into operating systems 
we expect that additional specialized graphics processing and general purpose computing capabilities will be integrated into future versions of intel and other pentium based microprocessors and that standard multimedia accelerators in the future will likely integrate memory  system logic  audio  communications or other additional functions 
in particular  intel and others have announced plans to develop chips that integrate graphics and processor functions to serve the lower cost pc market 
these could significantly reduce the demand for our products 
graphics boards are usually used in higher end personal computers offering the latest technology and performance features 
however  as graphics functionality becomes technologically stable and widely accepted by personal computer users  it typically migrates to the personal computer motherboard 
we expect this trend to continue  especially with respect to low end graphics boards 
in this regard  the mmx instruction set from intel and the expanded capabilities provided by the directx applications programming interface from microsoft have increased the capability of microsoft s operating systems to control display features that have traditionally been performed by graphics boards 
as a result of these trends of technology migration  our success largely depends on our ability to continue to develop products that incorporate new and rapidly evolving technologies that manufacturers have not yet fully incorporated onto personal computer motherboards or into operating systems 
although our joint venture with via is intended to produce integrated graphics core logic accelerator products that provide these functions  we have traditionally offered only single function graphics accelerator chips or chipsets 
we have and intend to continue to expand the scope of our research and development efforts to provide integrated graphics core logic accelerator products  which will require that we hire engineers skilled in these areas and promote additional coordination among our design and engineering groups 
alternatively  we may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to enable us to provide these functions  and we cannot assure you that any such technology will be available for license or purchase on terms acceptable to us 
we believe that a large portion of the growth in the sales of personal computers may be in sealed systems that contain most functionality on a single systems board and are not upgradeable in the same manner as are most personal computers 
these sealed computers would contain a systems board that could include cpu  system memory  graphics  audio and internet or network connectivity functionality on a single board 
although diamond acquired micronics computers in for the purposes of obtaining technical and marketing expertise and brand acceptance in cpu motherboard design and developing integrated multimedia system board products  we cannot assure you that a significant market will exist for low cost fixed system boards or that the acquisition of micronics will enable us to compete successfully in this emerging market or in the current motherboard market 
if we are unable to continue to develop and market new and enhanced products  our average selling prices and gross profits will likely decline 
we must continue to develop new products in order to maintain average selling prices and gross margins 
as the markets for our products continue to develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles will shorten and average selling prices will decline 
in particular  average selling prices and  in some cases  gross margins for each of our products will decline as products mature 
a decline in selling prices may cause the net sales in a quarter to be lower than those of a preceding quarter or corresponding quarter in a prior year  even if more units were sold during that quarter than in the preceding or corresponding quarter of a prior year 
to avoid that  we must successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new higher end and higher margin products to market in time to meet market demand 
the availability of new products is typically restricted in volume early in a product s life cycle 
if customers choose to wait for the new version of a product instead of purchasing the current version  our ability to procure sufficient volumes of these new products to meet higher customer demand will be limited 
if this happens  our revenues and operating margins could be harmed 
our products have short product life cycles  requiring us to manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
our products have short product life cycles 
if we fail to introduce new products successfully within a given time frame  our competitors could gain market share  which could cause us to lose revenue 
further  continued failure to introduce competitive new products on time could also damage our brand name  reputation and relationships with our customers and cause longer term harm to our financial condition 
also  we anticipate that the transition of the design of diamond s boards based on new graphics chip architectures by us will require significant effort 
our major oem customers typically introduce new computer system configurations as often as twice a year 
the life cycles of diamond s graphics boards typically range from six to twelve months and the life cycles of our graphic chips typically range from twelve to eighteen months 
short product life cycles are the result of frequent transitions in the computer market in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
our products must be able to support the new features and performance levels being required by personal computer manufacturers at the beginning of these transitions 
otherwise  we would likely lose business as well as the opportunity to compete for new design contracts until the next product transition 
failing to develop products with required features and performance levels or a delay as short as a few months in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues for a substantial period 
we may face inventory risks that are increased by a combination of short product life cycles and long component lead times 
the short product life cycles of our board based products also give rise to a number of risks involving product and component inventories 
these risks are heightened by the long lead times that are necessary to acquire some components of our products 
we may not be able to reduce our production or inventory levels quickly in response to unexpected shortfalls in sales 
this could leave us with significant and costly obsolete inventory 
long component lead times could cause these inventory levels to be higher than they otherwise would be and may also prevent us from quickly taking advantage of an unexpected new product cycle 
this can lead to costly lost sales opportunities and loss of market share  which could result in a loss of revenues 
for example  the timing and speed of the pci to agp bus transition and the sgram to sdram memory transition led to an excess inventory of pci and sgram based products at diamond and in its distribution channel  which in turn resulted in lower average selling prices  lower gross margins  end of life inventory write offs  and higher price protection charges during the second and third quarters of further  declining demand for an excess supply of monster d ii and competitive d gaming products in the channel during the third quarter of resulted in rapidly declining revenue and prices vis a vis the second quarter of  and resulted in price protection charges for this class of product in the third quarter of we estimate and accrue for potential inventory write offs and price protection charges  but we cannot assure you that these estimates and accruals will be sufficient in future periods  or that additional inventory write offs and price protection charges will not be required 
the impact of these charges on diamond s operating results in and the first quarter of was material 
any similar occurrence in the future could materially and adversely affect our operating results because as our subsidiary  diamond s charges will be included in our operating results on a going forward basis 
we depend on third parties for the manufacture of our products 
we currently rely on two foundries to manufacture all of our products either in finished form or wafer form 
we have a take or pay contract with tsmc and a joint venture foundry  usc 
our agreement with tsmc provides capacity through and requires us to make annual advance payments to purchase specified capacity to be applied against the following year s capacity or to forfeit advance payments against those amounts 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we wrote off approximately million of the prepaid production capacity because it did not fully utilize the capacity related to the advance payment 
as of december   our note payable to tsmc was million 
if we purchase excess inventories of particular products or choose to forfeit advance payments  our operating results could be harmed 
in  umc  the majority owner of the usc foundry joint venture  merged usc with umc 
as a result  we lost our ability to influence the usc board and any veto power we had over actions to be taken by usc 
our relationship with usc is therefore based on a foundry capacity agreement rather than a joint venture 
although we are currently unaware of any changes that umc may propose in the future to the foundry relationship  we will have less ability to influence usc if changes adverse to us are made in the future 
we conduct business with one of our current foundries by delivering written purchase orders specifying the particular product ordered  quantity  price  delivery date and shipping terms 
this foundry is therefore not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
to the extent a foundry terminates its relationship with us or our supply from a foundry is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  such as a natural disaster or an injunction arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient advanced process technology foundry capacity to meet customer demand in the future 
from time to time  we may evaluate potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such sources will be able or willing to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or per unit prices 
tsmc and usc are both located in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan 
we currently expect these foundries to supply the substantial portion of our graphics accelerator chips and s via joint venture products in and disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including work stoppages  political or military conflicts  earthquakes or other natural disasters  could cause delays in shipments of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  in september  taiwan experienced a major earthquake 
the earthquake and its resulting aftershocks caused power outages and significant damage to taiwan s infrastructure 
the result was delays of shipments of our products from the tsmc and usc foundries in taiwan 
any such future delays could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the science based industrial park  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity could adversely affect our foundries ability to supply our products  which could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
we rely on independent subcontractors to manufacture  assemble or test certain of our products 
we procure our components  assembly and test services and assembled products through purchase orders and we do not have specific volume purchase agreements with each of our subcontractors 
most our subcontractors could cease supplying the services  products or components at any time with limited or no penalty 
if we need to replace a key subcontractor  we could incur significant manufacturing set up costs and delays 
also  we may be unable to find suitable replacement subcontractors 
our emphasis on maintaining low internal and channel inventory levels may exacerbate the effects of any shortage that may result from the use of sole source subcontractors during periods of tight supply or rapid order growth 
further  some of our subcontractors are located outside the united states  which may present heightened process control  quality control  political  infrastructure  transportation  tariff  regulatory  legal  import  export  economic or supply chain management risks 
we have significant product concentration and significantly depend on the health of the graphics and multimedia accelerator market  which means that a decline in demand for a single product  or in the graphics and multimedia accelerator market in general  could severely impact overall revenues and financial results 
our revenues are dependent on the markets for graphics video chips for pcs and on our ability to compete in those markets 
our business would be materially harmed if we are unsuccessful in selling these graphic chips 
historically  over of the net sales of our subsidiary  diamond  have come from sales of graphics and video accelerator subsystems 
although diamond has introduced audio subsystems  has entered the pc modem and home networking markets  and has entered into the pc consumer electronics market with its rio internet music player  graphics and video accelerator subsystems are expected to continue to account for the majority of our sales for the foreseeable future 
a decline in demand or average selling prices for graphics and video accelerator subsystems  whether as a result of new competitive product introductions  price competition  excess supply  widespread cost reduction  technological change  incorporation of the products functionality onto personal computer motherboards or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
we may not be able to successfully manage the growth and expansion of our business 
in the past year  and particularly with the merger with diamond  the company has experienced a significant expansion in the overall level of its business and the scope of its operations  including manufacturing  research and development  marketing  technical support  customer service  sales and logistics 
this expansion in scope has resulted in a need for significant investment in infrastructure  process development and information systems 
this requirement includes  without limitation securing adequate financial resources to successfully integrate and manage the growing businesses and acquired companies  retention of key employees  integration of management information  product data management  control  accounting  telecommunications and networking systems  establishment of a significant worldwide web and e commerce presence  consolidation of geographically dispersed manufacturing and distribution facilities  coordination of suppliers  rationalization of distribution channels  establishment and documentation of business processes and procedures  and integration of various functions and groups of employees 
each of these requirements poses significant  material challenges 
the company s future operating results will depend in large measure on its success in implementing operating  manufacturing and financial procedures and controls  improving communication and coordination among the different operating functions  integrating certain functions such as sales  procurement and operations  strengthening management information and telecommunications systems  and continuing to hire additional qualified personnel in certain areas 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage these activities and implement these additional systems  procedures and controls successfully  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s short term and long term operating results 
a significant portion of our sales are concentrated within a limited number of customers 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
if we lose one or more of these customers  our operating results would be harmed 
in  three customers  ibm corporation  dell computer corporation and synnex technology  inc synnex accounted for  and respectively  of net sales 
in  three customers  synnex  ibm corporation and promate electronics co  accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales 
in  three customers  synnex  cnw international limited  and compaq computer corporation  accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales 
synnex  cnw international limited and promate electronics co 
are distributors 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers  who we may be unable to retain 
our strategic customers may cancel or reschedule orders 
canceled orders may not be replaced by other sales  adversely impacting our operating results 
the manufacturers on which we depend may experience manufacturing yield problems that could increase our per unit costs and otherwise jeopardize the success of our products 
our primary products  graphics chips  are difficult to manufacture 
the production of graphic chips requires a complex and precise process that often presents problems that are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to solve 
as a result  companies like us often experience problems in achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
our chips are manufactured from round wafers made of silicon 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous individual integrated circuits  or chips 
we may reject or be unable to sell a percentage of wafers or chips on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  electrical performance  wafer breakage  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final good chips that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of chips that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yields 
these yields reflect the quality of a particular wafer 
depending on the specific product  in the past  we negotiated with our manufacturers to pay either an agreed upon price for all wafers or a price that is typically higher for only wafers of acceptable quality 
if the payment terms for a specific product require us to pay for all wafers  and if yields associated with that product are poor  we bear the risk of those poor manufacturing yields 
our semiconductor  semiconductor based or software products could have design defects 
product components may contain undetected errors or bugs when first supplied to the company that  despite testing by the company  are discovered only after certain of the company s products have been installed and used by customers 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in the company s products due to errors in such products components  or that any such errors will not impair the market acceptance of these products or require significant product recalls 
problems encountered by customers or product recalls could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  the company continues to upgrade the firmware  software drivers and software utilities that are incorporated into or included with its hardware products 
the company s software products  and its hardware products incorporating such software  are extremely complex due to a number of factors  including the products advanced functionality  the diverse operating environments in which the products may be deployed  the rapid pace of technology development and change in the company s target product categories  the need for interoperability  and the multiple versions of such products that must be supported for diverse operating platforms  languages and standards 
these products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the company generally provides a warranties for its retail products and  in general  the company s return policies may permit return for full credit within thirty days after receipt of products that do not meet product specifications 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company  by its suppliers and by current or potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance or product acceptance or in warranty returns 
such loss or delay would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  new versions or upgrades to operating systems  independent software vendor titles or applications may require upgrades to the company s software products to maintain compatibility with such new versions or upgrades 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new versions or enhancements to its software or that the company will not experience delays in the upgrade of its software products 
in the event that the company experiences delays or is unable to maintain compatibility with operating systems and independent software vendor titles or applications  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to risks relating to product returns and price protection 
we often grant limited rights to customers to return unsold inventories of our products in exchange for new purchases  also known as stock rotation 
we also often grant price protection on unsold inventory  which allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when our published price is reduced 
also  some of our retail customers will readily accept returned products from their own retail customers 
these returned products are then returned to us for credit 
we estimate returns and potential price protection on unsold inventory in our distribution channel 
we accrue reserves for estimated returns  including warranty returns and price protection  and since the fourth quarter of  we reserve the gross margin associated with channel inventory levels that exceed four weeks of demand 
we may be faced with further significant price protection charges as our competitors move to reduce channel inventory levels of current products  such as our monster fusion  as new product introductions are made 
we depend on sales through distributors 
if relationships with or sales through distributors decline  our operating results will be harmed 
we sell our products through a network of domestic and international distributors  and directly to major retailers mass merchants  value added resellers and oem customers 
our future success is dependent on the continued viability and financial stability of our customer base 
computer distribution and retail channels historically have been characterized by rapid change  including periods of widespread financial difficulties and consolidation and the emergence of alternative sales channels  such as direct mail order  telephone sales by pc manufacturers and electronic commerce on the worldwide web 
the loss of  or a reduction in  sales to certain of our key distribution customers as a result of changing market conditions  competition or customer credit problems could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
likewise  changes in distribution channel patterns  such as increased electronic commerce via the internet  increased use of mail order catalogues  increased use of consumer electronics channels for personal computer sales  or increased use of channel assembly to configure pc systems to fit customers requirements could affect us in ways not yet known 
for example  the rapid emergence of internet based e commerce  in which products are sold direct to consumers at low prices  is putting substantial strain on some of our traditional distribution channels 
inventory levels of our products in the two tier distribution channels generally are maintained in a range of one to two months of customer demand 
these channel inventory levels tend toward the low end of the months of supply range when demand is stronger  sales are higher and products are in short supply 
conversely  during periods when demand is slower  sales are lower and products are abundant  channel inventory levels tend toward the high end of the months of supply range 
frequently  in these situations  we attempt to ensure that distributors devote a greater degree of their working capital  sales and logistics resources to our products instead of to our competitors 
similarly  our competitors attempt to ensure that their own products are receiving a disproportionately higher share of the distributors working capital and logistics resources 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotional expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on our operating results 
further  in an event like this  high channel inventory levels may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing net sales and gross profit 
consequently  in taking steps to bring our channel inventory levels down to a more desirable level  we may cause a shortfall in net sales during one or more accounting periods 
these efforts to reduce channel inventory might also result in price protection charges if prices are decreased to move product out to final consumers  having a further adverse impact on operating results 
we accrue for potential price protection charges on unsold channel inventory 
we cannot assure you  however  that any estimates  reserves or accruals will be sufficient or that any future price reductions will not seriously harm our operating results 
we rely on intellectual property and other proprietary information that may not be adequately protected and that may be expensive to protect 
the industry in which we compete is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we rely heavily on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our business may suffer from the piracy of our technology and the associated loss of sales 
also  the protection provided to our proprietary technology by the laws of foreign jurisdictions  many of which offer less protection than the united states  may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
it is common in the personal computer industry for companies to assert intellectual property infringement claims against other companies 
therefore  our products may also become the target of infringement claims 
these infringement claims or any future claims could cause us to spend significant time and money to defend our products  redesign our products or develop or license a substitute technology 
we may be unsuccessful in acquiring or developing substitute technology and any required license may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  an adverse result in litigation could require us to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale  offer for sale and importation of infringing products  or discontinue the use of certain processes 
any of those events could materially harm our business 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense to us and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
however  even if claims do not have merit  we may be required to dedicate significant management time and expense to defending ourselves if we are directly sued  or assisting our oem customers in their defense of these or other infringement claims pursuant to indemnity agreements 
this could have a negative effect on our financial results 
for example  intel corporation is currently in litigation with via with whom we recently entered into a joint venture to bring high performance integrated graphics and core logic chip sets to the volume oem desktop and notebook pc markets 
the result of such litigation could have an adverse effect on the company 
our products depend upon third party certifications  which may not be granted for future products  resulting in product shipment delays and lost sales 
we submit most of our products for compatibility and performance testing to the microsoft windows hardware quality lab because our oem customers typically require our products to have this certification prior to making volume purchases 
this certification typically requires up to several weeks to complete and entitles us to claim that a particular product is designed for microsoft windows 
we may not receive this certification for future products in a timely fashion  or at all  which could result in product shipment delays and lost sales 
we may not be able to retain or integrate key personnel  which may prevent us from succeeding 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel or attract other qualified personnel in the future 
our success will depend upon the continued service of key management personnel 
the loss of services of any of the key members of our management team or our failure to attract and retain other key personnel could disrupt our operations and have a negative effect on employee productivity and morale  decreasing production and harming our financial results 
in addition  the competition to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical  sales and operations personnel is intense 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty recruiting qualified software and hardware development engineers 
we depend on a limited number of third party developers and publishers that develop graphics software products that will operate with and fully utilize the capabilities of our products to generate demand for our products 
only a limited number of software developers are capable of creating high quality entertainment software 
because competition for these resources is intense and is expected to increase  a sufficient number of high quality  commercially successful software titles compatible with our products may not be developed 
we believe that the availability of numerous high quality  commercially successful software entertainment titles and applications significantly affects sales of multimedia hardware to the pc based interactive d entertainment market 
we depend on third party software developers and publishers to create  produce and market software titles that will operate with our d graphics accelerators 
if a sufficient number of successful software titles are not developed  our product sales and revenues could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the development and marketing of game titles that do not fully demonstrate the technical capabilities of our products could create the impression that our technology offers only marginal or no performance improvements over competing products 
either of these effects could have an adverse effect on our product sales and financial results 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers from whom we do not have a guarantee of adequate supplies  increasing the risk that a loss of or problems with a single supplier could result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
we obtain several of the components used in our products from single or limited sources 
if component manufacturers do not allocate a sufficient supply of components to meet our needs or if current suppliers do not provide components of adequate quality or compatibility  we may have to obtain these components from distributors or on the spot market at a higher cost 
we rarely have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers  and suppliers may not be able to meet our current or future component requirements 
if we are forced to use alternative suppliers of components  we may have to alter our product designs to accommodate these components 
alteration of product designs to use alternative components could cause significant delays and could require product recertification by our oem customers or reduce our production of the related products 
in addition  from time to time we have experienced difficulty meeting certain product shipment dates to customers for various reasons 
these reasons include component delivery delays  component shortages  system compatibility difficulties and component quality deficiencies 
delays in the delivery of components  component shortages  system compatibility difficulties and supplier product quality deficiencies will continue to occur in the future 
these delays or problems have in the past and could in the future result in impaired margins  reduced production volumes  strained customer relations and loss of business 
for example  dram and flash memory components  which are used in our graphics boards and rio digital audio players  significantly increased in price in september due in part to supply interruptions arising from the earthquake in taiwan 
in addition  industry wide demand for flash memory components has increased dramatically  causing increases in price and shortages in supply 
these price increases may have an adverse impact on our gross margin in future periods 
also  in an effort to avoid actual or perceived component shortages  we may purchase more of certain components than we otherwise require 
excess inventory resulting from such over purchases  obsolescence or a decline in the market value of such inventory could result in inventory write offs  which would have a negative effect on our financial results as happened in the first and second quarters of similarly  diamond s perception of component shortages caused diamond to over purchase certain components and pay surcharges for components that subsequently declined in value in the second  third and fourth quarters of in addition  our inventory sell offs or sell offs by our competitors could trigger channel price protection charges  further reducing our gross margins and profitability  as occurred with the monster d ii product line in the third and fourth quarters of we may experience product delivery delays due to the inadequacy or incompatibility of software drivers 
such delays could hurt our sales 
some components of our products require software drivers in order for those components to work properly in a pc 
these software drivers are essential to the performance of nearly all of our products and must be compatible with the other components of the graphics board and pc in order for the product to work 
some of these products that include software drivers are among those products based on components  including software drivers  that are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced product delivery delays due to inadequacy or incompatibility of software drivers either provided by component suppliers or developed internally by them 
these delays could cause us to lose sales  revenues and customers 
software driver problems will continue to occur in the future  and those problems could negatively affect our operating results 
we have significant exposure to international markets 
export sales accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales  as a percentage of net sales  will remain at current levels 
diamond s net sales in europe accounted for and of total net sales during and  respectively 
diamond s other international net sales accounted for and of total net sales for it during and  respectively 
in addition  a substantial proportion of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
as a result  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets or increase the cost of wafers and components purchased by us  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  potentially longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax treatment  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
in the past  we have experienced an adverse impact associated with the economic downturn in asia that contributed to decreases in net sales 
in addition  our international operations are subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
the people s republic of china and taiwan have in the past experienced and are currently experiencing strained relations  and a worsening of relations or the development of hostilities between them could disrupt operations at our foundries and affect our taiwanese customers 
we have a significant level of debt 
at december   we had total debt and other long term liabilities outstanding of million 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our significant leverage could also adversely affect our liquidity  as a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to meet such debt service requirements 
our stock price is highly volatile and we expect that our stock price will continue to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile  like that of the common stock of many other semiconductor companies 
we expect our common stock to remain volatile 
this volatility may result from general market conditions and market conditions affecting technology and semiconductor stocks generally  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of design wins  technological innovations  acquisitions  investments or business alliances  by us or our competitors  and the commencement of  developments in or outcome of litigation 
the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors  especially if our operating results do not meet those expectations 
reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views 
the fact that we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not necessarily mean that we will do so in the future 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
we are currently involved in securities class action litigation and diamond is also involved in similar proceedings 
we are party to legal proceedings alleging securities violations that could have a negative financial impact on us 
since november  a number of complaints have been filed in federal and state courts seeking an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased shares of our common stock at various times between april  and november  the complaints name us as defendants as well as certain of our officers and former officers and certain of our directors  asserting that we and they violated federal and state securities laws by misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about our business 
in addition  certain shareholders have filed derivative actions in the state courts of california and delaware seeking recovery on our behalf  alleging  among other things  breach of fiduciary duties by such individual defendants 
the plaintiffs in the derivative action in delaware have not taken any steps to pursue their case 
the derivative cases in california state court have been consolidated  and plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended complaint 
the court has entered a stipulated order in those derivative cases suspending court proceedings and coordinating discovery in them with discovery in the class actions in california state courts 
on plaintiffs motion  the federal court has dismissed the federal class actions without prejudice 
the class actions in california state court have been consolidated  and plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended complaint 
the company has answered that complaint 
discovery is pending 
while our management intends to defend the actions against us vigorously  there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with regards to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are also defending several putative class action lawsuits naming diamond which were filed in june and july and june in the california superior court for santa clara county and the us district court for the northern district of california 
certain former executive officers and directors of diamond are also named as defendants 
the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased diamond s common stock between october  and june  the class period 
the complaints allege claims under the federal securities laws and california law 
the plaintiffs allege that diamond and the other defendants made various material misrepresentations and omissions during the class period 
the complaints do not specify the amount of damages sought 
on march   the district court for the northern district of california dismissed the federal action without prejudice 
we believe that we have good defenses to the claims alleged in the california superior court lawsuit and will defend ourselves vigorously against this action 
no trial date has been set for this action 
the ultimate outcome of this action cannot be presently determined 
accordingly  no provision for any liability or loss that may result from adjudication or settlement thereof has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have been named  with diamond  as a defendant in litigation relating to the merger 
on august   two alleged stockholders of diamond filed a lawsuit  captioned strum v 
schroeder  et al  in the superior court of the state of california for the county of santa clara 
plaintiffs  on behalf of themselves and a class of all former diamond stockholders similarly situated whom they purportedly represent  challenge the terms of the merger 
the complaint names diamond  the former directors of diamond and us as defendants 
the complaint alleges generally that diamond s directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders of diamond and seeks rescission and the recovery of unspecified damages  fees and expenses 
while our management intends to defend the actions against us vigorously  there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with regards to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have also received from the sec a request for information relating to our financial restatement announcement in november we have responded and intend to continue to respond to the sec requests
