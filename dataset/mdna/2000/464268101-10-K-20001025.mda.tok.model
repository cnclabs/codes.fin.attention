sales analysis and review to comparison our sales for the year ended july  of  were six percent above sales of  sales of our core products wastewater samplers  flow meters  and liquid chromatography products were up percent 
liquid chromatography sales accounted for percent of the increase in core product sales  samplers accounted for percent  and flow meters accounted for four percent 
sales of our other products process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  syringe pumps  geomation  and stip products were comparable to fiscal levels 
sfe  process monitoring and syringe pumps all provided increased sales while geomation and stip sales were down compared to us sales of our core products increased percent over  with chromatography accounting for the majority of this increase 
international sales of these products increased by eight percent 
liquid chromatography products accounted for the majority of the international sales increase

sales of geomation and stip products accounted for the majority of the decrease 
we received net orders of  this was comparable to net orders of  received in fiscal the backlog  including geomation s backlog of  at july  was  down percent from the beginning of the year 
as of september  our backlog  excluding geomation  was  all of which is scheduled for delivery prior to july   the close of fiscal to comparison our sales of  were eight percent above sales of  approximately percent of the year over year sales increase was the result of a full year s sales contribution of stip that was acquired during the second quarter of last year 
sales of our core products wastewater samplers  flow meters  and liquid chromatography products were up percent

net loss the operating performances over the last five years have been negatively impacted by significant non recurring charges 
these items are identified under item  selected financial data 
pro forma data has been included in this selected financial data that removes the impact of these non recurring charges and the operations of geomation since fiscal to comparison we incurred an operating loss of  for fiscal compared with a loss of  for fiscal during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year management determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to sell the geomation operations 
this decision was a result of reviewing the strategic fit of geomation with the overall isco strategy and the deterioration in the operating performance of geomation during the fiscal year 
this decision resulted in recording a  operating loss on the impairments and disposition of geomation assets 
the net operating assets of geomation were sold on october  to an investment group led by the current management of geomation 
details related to this sale are disclosed in note s of the financial statements 
during the third quarter of the fiscal year management decided not to complete the suspended implementation of the erp operating system at the isco lincoln facility 
this implementation project was originally suspended during the third quarter of fiscal year because of continual software instability problems 
this decision resulted in a non cash operating charge of  for fiscal year without these two items fiscal year would have generated an operating income of  a significant improvement over fiscal year this improvement is due to an improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the gross margin  as a percentage of sales  improved to percent in from percent in this improvement was the result of several factors 
we generated operational improvements at our isco lincoln facility that resulted in reduced indirect manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in stip s contribution to the overall entity at a lower gross margin 
isco lincoln s indirect manufacturing costs  as a percentage of sales  were higher in fiscal due to the additional labor hours and inefficiencies that were associated with the consolidation and relocation of the manufacturing operations  the initiation of process improvement activities  and activities associated with upgrading and converting data related to the superior street facility s erp operating system 
we reduced our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses by  and approximately five percent as a percentage of sales from the fiscal year level 
this improvement was due to reduced marketing expenditures and temporarily open marketing and sales positions 
in addition  fiscal year was impacted by costs related to the yk conversion activity 
research and engineering expenses declined by approximately  and by approximately one percent as a percentage of sales from the fiscal year level 
this improvement was a result of reductions in staffing at isco lincoln and the timing of expenditures for product development projects 
investment income increased by approximately percent compared to last year 
this increase was a result of increased excess cash reserves available for investment in fiscal over fiscal interest expense increased by approximately percent compared to last year 
this increase was due to the loan  obtained by isco lincoln in december  only being in place for a portion of fiscal other non operating income increased by approximately percent compared to fiscal year included the write off of  of undepreciated building components that were associated with the renovation of the superior street facility 
we recognized a net tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent for the current year compared with a net tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent last year 
the current year s effective rate was significantly reduced due to the non deductibility on the write off of the intangible assets related to the disposition of geomation 
tax benefits generated by isco s foreign sales corporation helped to offset this impact 
last year s tax benefit was reduced by the establishment of a valuation allowance against the tax benefits generated on the net operating losses incurred by stip and geomation 
to comparison we incurred an operating loss of  for fiscal compared with a loss of  for fiscal all entities contributed to the current year s loss 
the gross margin  as a percentage of sales  declined from percent in to percent in the current year s lower gross margin is a result of increased sales discounts and increased indirect manufacturing costs associated with the isco lincoln operations  and the increase in stip s contribution to the overall entity at a lower gross margin 
isco lincoln s indirect manufacturing costs increased due to additional costs incurred in support of the consolidation and relocation of the manufacturing operations  the initiation of process improvement activities  and activities associated with upgrading and converting data related to the superior street facility s erp operating system 
our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined from percent to percent 
selling expenses  as a percentage of sales  for all of the company s entities  declined when compared with last year 
selling expenses last year included costs related to the acquisition of geomation and stip  and higher amortization expenses 
during the current year  management was able to reduce the selling expenses at stip 
our general and administrative g a expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased when compared with last year 
last year g a expenses of isco lincoln included the write off of the suprex intangibles that were offset in the current year with the costs associated with making our erp operating system yk compliant and with the settlement costs of the patent infringement litigation 
in addition  the g a expenses of stip and geomation increased 
engineering expenses  as a percentage of sales  were approximately percent for fiscal compared with approximately percent for fiscal this is due to reduced development activities that were nearing completion during the current fiscal year 
last year s expenses included a one time charge for purchased r d related to the acquisition of geomation 
investment income decreased by approximately percent and interest expense increased approximately percent compared to last year 
these changes were due to the continued sale of investments that began last year and the acquisition of debt during the current year to meet the cash needs for the expansion renovation of the superior street facility and the erp operating system 
other non operating income was down approximately percent due to the disposition of building components related to the building renovation and a loss from the aftco joint venture 
we realized a tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent for the current year compared with a net tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent last year 
for both fiscal years the tax benefits were primarily the result of the operating losses incurred 
the fiscal benefit included a benefit from adjustments in prior years state and federal tax estimates offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance against the tax benefits realized from the current year s operating losses incurred by stip and geomation and reduced tax benefits from tax exempt income 
the fiscal benefit included a benefit from tax exempt income offset by the non deductibility of amortization expense on intangibles 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities generated million of cash flow during fiscal compared with million during fiscal this increase is due to the improved operational performance 
the net loss for fiscal year when adjusted for depreciation  the write off of the erp system  and the loss on the impairments and disposition of geomation assets provided us with million of cash from operations before million of investments in net operating assets 
in fiscal the net loss when adjusted for depreciation provided us with million of cash from operations before  of investments in net operating assets 
in february  we completed the sale of the westgate facility 
this sale plus proceeds from sales of used equipment provided us with million in cash 
we invested the cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the sales of equipment and building into long term and short term investments of million 
our net cash position decreased by million 
this decrease was a result of investments in property  plant and equipment of million and a net reduction in debt of  at july   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of at year end  our total debt was  with  payable next year 
in addition  we had lines of credit with various banks totaling million of which million was available for future business needs 
future events the change of the century yk did not impact isco relative to our internal operating systems  our ability to deliver product to customers  and our products continued to function as intended 
we continue to work to resolve the current lawsuit related to the baan enterprise resource planning erp software that was intended to be isco lincoln s operating system solution to the change of the century problem 
the details on this lawsuit are discussed part i  item  legal proceedings 
factors affecting future results the factors affecting our future performance remain the same as last year 
these factors are improved sales growth  improvement of gross margins  controlled operating expenses  integration and coordination between isco entities and our joint venture  dealing with the external regulatory influences on our primary markets  and dealing with the effect of the consolidation of companies within the instrumentation industry 
we accomplished many of our focused goals this past fiscal year related to sales growth  improved gross margins  and controlling our operating expenses 
we believe there are still improvements to be made in these areas 
late in fiscal year we changed the distribution of environmental products within germany 
our focus in fiscal will be to ensure that we are meeting our customer needs within germany and improve our internal operations between the stip and isco lincoln facilities to benefit our customers and shareholders 
our environmental market still accounts for a significant amount of our sales 
this market is regulation driven and is strongly influenced by both the perceived attitude and actions of various governmental agencies in the promulgation and enforcement of environmental regulations 
the effects of the regulatory climate on the market are outside our ability to control and  for any given period  may be either a positive or negative factor on our performance 
as in many industries  consolidation of companies within our market is ongoing 
as a result  we are dealing with the effects of larger  well financed competitors who also have the organizational resources to compete aggressively in the global market place 
market risk interest rate risk and currency exchange risks are the primary market risks to which we are exposed 
we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
our other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts and notes payable  and long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  and accounts and notes payable balances are generally short term in nature and do not expose our company to material market risk 
at july   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt 
in addition  we had million of variable rate credit facilities  of which approximately million was outstanding under these credit facilities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates on the debt and credit facilities would have a material effect on our results of operations  given our current obligations under these debt and credit facilities 
related to currency exchange  international sales of our united states based operations are denominated in us dollars and international sales of our german subsidiary are denominated in deutsche marks 
the currency exchange risk at the current level of activity is not material to our operating results or financial position 
our market risk resulting from the translation of the profit and loss of stip and from our permanent investment in our foreign subsidiaries is not material 
inflation the effect of inflation on our costs and our ability to pass on cost increases in the form of increased prices is dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environment 
the general level of inflation in the us economy has been relatively low for the past several years and has not  to date  had a significant effect on our company
