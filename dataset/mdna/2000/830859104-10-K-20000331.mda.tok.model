additional factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following important factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we reported losses in fiscal and may not be profitable in the future 
while we have been profitable in the past  we incurred a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december  we expect to experience fluctuations in our future operating results due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including the following o the demand for our products and services  o the level of competition in the merchants we serve  o our success in maintaining and expanding our distribution channels  o our success in attracting and retaining motivated and qualified personnel  o our ability to expand into existing and new domestic  as well as international markets  o our development and marketing of new products and services  o our ability to control costs  and o general economic conditions 
our operating results will be materially and adversely affected if we do not successfully address these and other risks 
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital 
our existing line of credit is not sufficient to permit the company to fully implement its business plan 
in order to fully implement our growth strategy  we will need to raise additional capital from third parties or otherwise secure additional financing for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully raise additional capital or secure other financing  or that such funding will be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
to the extent we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or secure other financing  this could have a material adverse effect on the company and we may be unable to fully implement our planned growth strategy 
our business may not grow in the future 
since our inception  we have rapidly expanded our operations  growing from total revenues of  in to total revenues of million in our continued future growth will depend to a significant degree on our ability to increase revenues from our existing businesses  maintain existing channel partner relationships and develop new channel partner relationships  expand our product and content offering to consumers  while maintaining adequate gross margins  and implement other programs that increase the circulation of the skymall print catalogs and generate traffic for our e commerce programs 
our ability to implement our growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond our control  including o our ability to select products that appeal to our customer base and effectively market them to our target audience  o sustained or increased levels of airline travel  particularly in domestic airline markets  o increasing adoption by consumers of the internet for shopping  o the continued perception by participating merchants that we offer an effective marketing channel for their products and services  and o our ability to attract  train and retain qualified employees and management 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy 
our future growth is in part dependent upon the continued growth of the electronic commerce market 
the market for the sale of products and services over the internet is a new and rapidly evolving market 
our future growth strategy is partially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of online services as an avenue for retail purchases 
there is no assurance that consumers will continue to make purchases over the internet in the future 
in order for us to grow our online customer base  we will need to attract purchasers who have historically relied upon traditional venues for making their retail purchases 
if use of online services does not continue to grow as expected  or if the technological infrastructure for the internet is unable to effectively support its growing use  our growth strategy  business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to manage the potential growth of our business 
our potential growth may place significant demands upon our personnel  management and financial resources 
in order to manage this growth  we may have to hire additional personnel and develop additional management infrastructure 
there is no assurance that people with the necessary skills and experience will be available as needed or on terms favorable to us 
there is no assurance that our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations  that we will be able to attract  hire  train  retain  motivate and manage necessary personnel  or that our management will be able to identify  manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
if we are unable to effectively manage any potential growth  our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our plans for international operations pose additional risks 
we have limited experience in selling our products and services internationally 
international operations place additional burdens upon our management  personnel and financial resources and may cause the company to incur losses 
we also face different and additional competition in these international markets 
in addition  international operations have certain unique risks  such as regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  political instability and potentially adverse tax implications 
to the extent we operate or expand our business internationally  we also are subject to risks associated with international monetary exchange fluctuations 
any one of these risks could affect our international operations  as well as have a material adverse impact upon our overall business operations  growth and financial condition 
we face intense competition 
the distribution channels for our products are highly competitive 
from time to time in our airline catalog business  competitors  typically other catalog retailers  have attempted to secure contracts with various airlines to offer merchandise to their customers 
american airlines currently offers merchandise catalogs to its customers through a competitor 
in addition  in july  twa  a former skymall partner  began carrying a competitor s catalog 
we also face competition for customers from airport based retailers  duty free retailers  specialty stores  department stores and specialty and general merchandise catalogs  many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we compete for customers with other in flight marketing media  such as airline sponsored in flight magazines and airline video programming 
in our electronic commerce sales  we face intense competition from other content providers and retailers who seek to offer their products and or services at their own web sites or those of other third parties 
the success of online marketing cannot be currently determined  and further penetration in this market will require substantial additional financial resources  acquisition of technology  investments in marketing and contractual relationships with third parties 
results will also be affected by existing competition  which the company anticipates will intensify  and by additional entrants to the market who may already have the necessary technology and expertise  many of whom may have substantially greater resources than the company 
dependence on channel relationships 
our business depends significantly on our relationships with the airlines  affiliate web sites  hotels and other channel partners 
some of our agreements with our channel partners are short term allowing the partner to terminate the relationship on to days advance notice 
there is no assurance that our channel partners will continue their relationships with us  and the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to maintain historical margin levels 
we may be unable to increase or maintain our gross margins at historical levels  particularly for our electronic commerce initiatives 
as competition in online shopping intensifies  our merchant participants may be unable or unwilling to participate in our programs when more favorable economic arrangements may be available from other third parties 
although many of our merchants have participated with us for several years  most of our relationships are short term and may be re negotiated by the merchant every days 
to the extent our gross margins decline from historical levels  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we face credit risks 
some participating merchants agree to pay a placement fee to us for including their merchandise in our programs 
we record an account receivable from the merchant for the placement fee 
in some cases  we collect the placement fee either from the merchant or by withholding it from amounts due to the merchant for merchandise sold 
to the extent that the placement fee receivable exceeds the sales of the merchant s products and the merchant is unable or unwilling to pay the difference to us  we may experience credit losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are vulnerable to increases in paper costs and airline fuel prices 
the cost of paper used to print our catalogs and the fees paid to airlines to reimburse them for the increased fuel costs associated with carrying our catalogs are significant expenses of our operations 
historically  paper and airline fuel prices have fluctuated significantly from time to time 
prices in the paper market can and often do change dramatically over a short period of time 
any significant increases in paper or airline fuel costs that we must pay could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our information and telecommunications systems may fail or be inadequate 
we process a large volume of relatively small orders 
consequently  our success depends to a significant degree on the effective operation of our information and telecommunications systems 
these systems could fail for unanticipated reasons or they may be inadequate to process any increase in our sales volume that may occur 
any extended failure of our information and telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with online security breaches or failures 
in order to successfully make sales over the internet  it is necessary that we can ensure the secure transmission of confidential customer information over public telecommunications networks 
we employ certain technology in order to protect such information  including customer credit card information 
however  there is no assurance that such information will not be intercepted illegally 
advances in cryptography or other developments that could compromise the security of confidential customer information could have a direct negative impact upon our electronic commerce business 
in addition  the perception by consumers that making purchases over the internet is not secure  even if unfounded  may mean that fewer consumers are likely to make purchases through that medium 
finally  any breach in security  whether or not a result of our acts or omissions  may cause us to be the subject of litigation  which could be very time consuming and expensive to defend 
we may not be able to adapt to rapidly changing technologies or we may incur significant costs in doing so 
the internet is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
as a result of the rapidly changing nature of the internet business  we may be subject to risks  now and in the future  of which we are not currently aware 
to be successful  we must adapt to our rapidly evolving market by continually enhancing our products and services and introducing new products and services to address our customers changing and increasingly sophisticated requirements 
we may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our e commerce transaction processing systems and infrastructure to meet customer requirements  competitive pressures  or emerging industry standards 
we could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we incur significant costs to adapt  or cannot adapt  to these changes 
because we depend on computer systems  a systems failure would cause a significant disruption to our business 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any event that interrupts or delays our operations 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our servers and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
any sustained or repeated systems interruptions that cause our web sites to become unavailable for use would result in our inability to service our customers 
while we have taken precautions against systems failure  interruptions could result from our failure to maintain our computer systems and equipment in effective working order  as well as natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failure  and similar events 
we currently maintain our computer systems at offices located in arizona  utah and new york 
in addition  our users depend on telecommunications providers  internet service providers  and network administration for access to our products and services 
our systems and equipment could experience outages  delays  and other difficulties as a result of system failures unrelated to our systems 
our equipment may be unable to support increased volume 
growth in the number of users accessing our web site may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and networking systems or the systems of our third party service providers  which could result in impaired performance or systems failure 
if this occurs  customer service and satisfaction may suffer  which could lead to dissatisfied users  reduced traffic  and an adverse impact on our business 
our current systems may be inadequate to accommodate rapid traffic growth on our servers 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  governmental or other regulatory bodies in the united states and abroad may adopt additional laws and regulations with respect to the internet that cover issues such as content  privacy  pricing  encryption standards  consumer protection  cross border commerce  electronic commerce  taxation  copyright infringement  and other intellectual property issues 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  content  taxation  defamation  and personal privacy is uncertain 
any new legislation or regulation or governmental enforcement of existing regulations may limit the growth of the internet  increase our cost of doing business or increase our legal exposure 
we currently are not subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses and specifically  mail order businesses 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that any future regulatory changes or development may have on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
changes in the regulatory environment relating to the internet could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
security protection for our network may be insufficient 
we believe that concern regarding the security of confidential information  such as credit card numbers  prevents many people from engaging in online commercial transactions 
we face potential security breaches from within our organization and from the public at large 
if we do not maintain sufficient security  we may be subject to additional legal exposure 
we have taken measures to protect the integrity of our infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information contained within our infrastructure 
nonetheless  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person circumvents our security measures  he or she could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
although we intend to continue to implement security measures  such measures have been circumvented in the past and we cannot provide assurance that measures we implemented will not be circumvented in the future 
although we do have firewalls protecting our systems from outside circumvention  such firewalls do not completely protect our systems from our own employees  should one or more of them become inclined to inflict damage upon our systems 
we may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
alleviating problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may require interruptions  delays  or cessation in service to our customers 
in addition  since we expect that our users will increasingly use the internet for commercial transactions in the future  any malfunction or security breach could cause these transactions to be delayed  not completed at all  or completed with compromised security 
our business is seasonal 
our business is seasonal in nature  with the greatest volume of sales typically occurring during the holiday selling season of the fourth calendar quarter 
during  approximately of our net merchandise sales were generated in the fourth quarter 
any substantial decrease in sales for the fourth quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face a risk of product liability claims 
our catalogs and our electronic commerce sites feature products and services from numerous participating merchants 
generally  our agreements with these participating merchants require the merchants to indemnify us and thereby be solely responsible for any losses arising from product liability claims made by customers  including the costs of defending any such claims  and to carry product liability insurance that names skymall as an additional insured 
in addition  we maintain product liability insurance in the aggregate amount of million and million per occurrence 
if a merchant was unable or unwilling to indemnify us as required  and any such losses exceeded our insurance coverage or were not covered by our insurer  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon our president and other key personnel 
we depend on the continued services of robert m 
worsley  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on the services of certain other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
worsley s services or of the services of certain other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the worsleys and wand partners inc 
can control many important company decisions 
as of march   mr 
worsley and his wife the worsleys beneficially owned  shares  or approximately of our outstanding common stock  and wand partners inc beneficially owned  or approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  the worsleys and wand partners have the ability to significantly influence the affairs of the company and matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of the company s directors  the amendment of the company s charter documents  the merger or dissolution of the company  and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the voting power of the worsleys and wand partners may also discourage or prevent any proposed takeover of the company pursuant to a tender offer 
the price of our common stock is extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
occurrences that could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate dramatically in the future include o new merchant agreements o the acquisition or loss of one or more airline  electronic commerce or other channel partners o fluctuations in our operating results o analyst reports  media stories  internet chat room discussions  news broadcasts and interviews o market conditions for retailers and electronic commerce companies in general o changes in airline fuel  paper or our other significant expenses o changes in the commissions we are able to negotiate with our merchants the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for companies that do some or all of their business on the internet 
during the fourth quarter of  net merchandise sales from the internet represented approximately of our net merchandise sales 
accordingly  the price of our common stock may be impacted by these or other trends 
our outstanding shares may be diluted 
the market price of our common stock may decrease as more shares of common stock become available for trading 
certain events over which you have no control result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  which would dilute your ownership percentage in skymall 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock o to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions  or o upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options and warrants as of march   there were outstanding warrants and options to acquire up to  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share 
if exercised  these securities will dilute the percentage ownership of holders of outstanding common stock of the company 
these securities  unlike the common stock  provide for anti dilution protection upon the occurrence of stock splits  redemptions  mergers  reclassifications  reorganizations and other similar corporate transactions  and  in some cases  major corporate announcements 
if one or more of these events occurs  the number of shares of common stock that may be acquired upon conversion or exercise would increase
