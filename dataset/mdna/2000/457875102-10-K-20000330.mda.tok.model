item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion in this section contains forward looking information that is subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  expressed or implied by such forward looking information 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by our use of words such as may  will  should  anticipates  believes  expects  plans  future  intends  could  estimate  predict  potential or contingent  the negative of these terms or other similar expressions 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed or implied herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results above 
among these risks are legislative acts  changes in the market value of salvage  competition  quality and quantity of inventory available from suppliers  and dependence on key insurance company suppliers 
overview the company offers insurance companies and other vehicle suppliers cost effective salvage processing solutions through a variety of different methods of sale  including percentage of sale consignment  fixed fee consignment  and purchase agreement 
under the percentage of sale consignment and fixed fee sales methods  the vehicle is not owned by the company and only the fees associated with the processing and sale of the vehicle are recorded in net sales 
the percentage of sale consignment method offers potentially increased profits over fixed fee consignment by providing incentive to both the company and the salvage provider to invest in vehicle enhancements thereby maximizing the vehicle selling prices 
under the purchase agreement sales method  the vehicle is owned by the company and the sales price of the vehicle is recorded in revenue 
by assuming some of the risk inherent in owning the salvage vehicle instead of selling on a consignment basis  the company is potentially able to increase profits by improving the value of the salvage vehicle prior to the sale 
under the purchase agreement method  iaa generally pays the insurance company a pre determined percentage of the acv to purchase the vehicle 
acv s are the estimated pre accident fair value of a vehicle  adjusted for additional equipment  mileage and other factors 
because the company s purchase price is fixed by contract  changes in acv s or in the market or auction prices for salvage vehicles have an impact on the profitability of the sale of vehicles under the purchase agreement method 
however  if increases in used car prices and acv s are not associated with a corresponding increase in prices at salvage auctions  there can be a negative impact on the profitability of purchase agreement sales 
to mitigate these risks  the company has adjustment and risk sharing clauses in its standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship 
the company has renegotiated most of its purchase agreement contracts and seeks to renegotiate certain others 
the company has added adjustment and risk sharing clauses to its new standard purchase agreement contracts designed to provide some protection to the company and its customers from certain unexpected  significant changes in the acv salvage price relationship
