item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have made forward looking statements in this annual report on form k that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations 
also  when we use such words as believe  expect  anticipate  plan  could  intend or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
you should note that an investment in our securities involves certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in factors that may affect future performance and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
overview finet 
com is a full service  on line mortgage banker that offers an easy to use  one stop mortgage source for consumers and mortgage brokers 
we operate one of the first sites on the internet that enables the consumer to apply for and receive credit approval on line  and to electronically search  analyze and select from a wide variety of mortgage loan products and rates offered by us and other lenders 
we make the mortgage process easier and more understandable  while maintaining quality service by controlling the consumer s entire mortgage lending experience 
we also provide on line and e commerce technologies and loan process management tools to mortgage broker businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with on line and other national lenders and brokers  and help their customers make better informed borrowing decisions 
we earn revenues through both the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
as a retail originator of loans  we generate loan origination income and loan related fees through loans funded and brokered by us 
our loan origination income consists of origination points paid to us by borrowers or discount points paid to us by wholesale lenders 
our loan related fees consist of application  documentation and processing fees paid by borrowers 
on the loans that we sell  we generate revenues from net premium income and interest income 
net premium income consists of the net gain on the sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights 
this net gain is recognized based upon the difference between the combined selling price of the loans and their related servicing rights  on the one hand  and the carrying value of the mortgage loans and servicing rights sold  on the other 
interest income consists of the interest we receive on our mortgage loans held for sale 
our costs and expenses consist largely of interest paid under our warehouse credit facilities  loan related expenses  consisting of fees paid to third parties for appraisal and credit report services and reserves for potential loan repurchase and premium recapture obligations  salaries  commissions and benefits paid to employees  general and administrative expenses such as occupancy costs  office expenses and professional services  and depreciation and amortization expense related principally to our facilities  computers and goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
seasonality affects the mortgage industry because loan originations are typically at their lowest levels during the first and fourth calendar quarters due to a reduced level of home buying activity during the winter months 
loan originations generally increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through october 
as a result  we may report earnings in these calendar quarters that are generally lower than that of the second and third calendar quarters 
however  due to significant refinance activity during and  which was generally affected more by changes in interest rates than by seasons  the expected seasonal patterns are not evident in our historical financial statements 
in the future  our expenses are also likely to vary quarter to quarter based upon fluctuations in the volume of loans we originate due to seasonality and other factors 
economic and interest rate cycles also affect the mortgage industry  as loan originations typically fall in rising interest rate environments 
during such periods  refinancing originations decrease as higher interest rates provide reduced economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgages 
due to stable and decreasing interest rate environments in prior years  our historical performance during those periods may not be indicative of results in rising interest rate environments such as in addition  our recent growth may distort some of our ratios and financial statistics and may make period to period comparisons difficult 
in light of this growth  our historical earnings performance may be of little relevance in predicting future performance 
furthermore  our financial statistics may not be indicative of our results in future periods 
on april   we acquired coastal federal mortgage in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
our results of operations and financial position for the fiscal years ended april  and have been restated to include coastal s results 
coastal s results for years prior to fiscal have not been included in our consolidated results  as they are not meaningful in assessing our historical trends 
on may   we acquired mical in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
mical s results of operations are included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition 
due to significant operating problems and losses at coastal and mical  our new management elected to close both units during fiscal impact of our discontinued units mical  coastal and our servicing business we incurred significant losses at both our mical and coastal subsidiaries during fiscal new management elected to discontinue the businesses of both of these subsidiaries in the last half of fiscal in addition  management determined that servicing loans would not be a part of on going operations and began preparing our servicing portfolios for sale 
the following table summarizes the impact these discontinued business units had on our consolidated operating results for the last three fiscal years ended april  and for the eight months ended december  eight months fiscal years ended april ended december  in thousands revenues    cost of revenues     gross loss profit     other expenses general and administrative     marketing and advertising special charges  depreciation and amortization other total expenses     income loss from operations    other interest expense income loss before income taxes    income tax expense net loss income    results of operations eight months ended december  compared to eight months ended december  revenues and volumes total loan volume for finet s production units is summarized below 
for the eight months ended december in thousands unaudited business to business   consumer direct   total loan volume   loan volume decreased million  or  to million for the eight months ended december  from million for the eight months ended december  revenues decreased million  or  to million for the eight months ended december  from million for the eight months ended december  the volume decrease was attributable primarily to the volume of the discontinued business units that were no longer operating in the eight months ended december  additionally  business to business segment volumes decreased in our continuing units 
mortgage lending rates have increased in the current fiscal year relative to the prior fiscal year  slowing mortgage industry originations 
in addition  price decreases negatively impacted revenues since they were not offset by volume increases 
we expect to increase revenues through the planned expansion of our sales force and increased emphasis on the business to business segment 
however  there can be no assurance that increased revenues will be achieved 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million for the eight months ended december  from million for the eight months ended december  however  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased  decreasing our gross profit to of revenues 
production personnel costs  the primary component of cost of revenues in our continuing businesses  were not decreased proportionately with volume decreases resulting in a negative impact on margins 
gross profit was also negatively affected by an increase in loan loss provisions of  to million from  for the for the eight months ended december  the increase is due to additional reserves provided at both our discontinued subsidiaries and our on going businesses 
our discontinued subsidiaries continue to incur losses related to loans previously sold off balance sheet risk 
our on going business required increased reserves due to increased volumes and slower sales of mortgages originated 
we also recorded  of expense related to the sale of our servicing portfolio which was completed during the eight months ended december  the company records provisions for losses to reflect market valuation allowances on mortgages held for sale and mortgage loans previously sold off balance sheet risk and provisions for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable primarily on a receivable by receivable basis  as accounts receivable is composed of amounts that do not necessarily carry similar risk characteristics  such as amounts heldback by purchasers on sales of mortgage loans and amounts heldback on sales of servicing rights 
additionally  the company maintains communications with such purchasers and others from whom receivables are due and in certain circumstances  determines the allowance necessary based on agreed upon amounts 
the company determines its market valuation allowance relating to mortgages held for sale and mortgages that have been sold primarily on a loan by loan basis 
the allowance is based on factors such as market values  bids received  industry loss experience and the company s prior loss experience  if any  as well as risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
warehouse interest expense decreased million or to million for the eight months ended december  from million for the eight months ended december  primarily due to the volume decrease 
in addition  we employed our excess cash to fund our mortgage inventory during a portion of the eight month period  whereas for the period ended december   we financed over of our mortgage inventory 
also  in fiscal  our primary warehouse lender allowed certain excess cash balance accounts to be offset against amounts due on warehouse borrowings  thereby further reducing our warehouse interest expense for the current fiscal period compared to the comparable period of the prior year 
the decrease in inventory financing in the period ended december compared to the period resulted in lower warehouse facility borrowings  contributing to the decrease in interest expense 
operating expenses general and administrative personnel costs and other general and administrative costs of our continuing businesses increased million  or  to million in the eight months ended december  from million in the eight months ended december  decreases attributable to the discontinued units were offset by significant increases in personnel costs as well as professional fees at the continuing units 
personnel costs have increased as finet increased its management team and hired additional sales and production employees in anticipation of increased volumes 
in addition  general and administrative expenses have increased significantly as the result of our spending associated with becoming year compliant 
marketing and advertising we initiated a number of marketing relationships in the eight months ended december  designed to attract prospective customers to our website 
as a result  marketing and advertising increased million to million for the eight months ended december  from  in the eight months ended december  finet intends to significantly decrease its spending on branding over the subsequent twelve months relative to spending incurred in the current eight month period 
special charges 
special charges of million and million were established in the eight month period ended december  and fiscal the special charges include million of goodwill write off and restructuring charges associated with the discontinuance of the business of mical for fiscal   writedown of purchased software for fiscal and  to liquidate certain assets and liabilities in connection with the discontinuance of the business of coastal for fiscal during the eight months ended december   the company expensed million net book value of fixed assets as a result of a relocation of the corporate headquarters and primary operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the eight months ended december  increased by  or  to  from  is fiscal the increase was due primarily to the amortization of the goodwill associated with the purchase of certain assets and operations of lowestrate  and increased depreciation associated with our purchases of property  plant and equipment 
other interest expense other interest expense decreased million to zero for the eight months ended december  from million for the eight months ended december  during the eight months ended december   we incurred other interest expense as we amortized our subordinated convertible debt discount 
we also incurred interest expense related to certain notes payable  a working capital line of credit  and borrowings for the previous purchase of servicing assets 
these obligations were reduced to zero during the eight months ended december   therefore  we did not incur material interest expense other than warehouse interest expense during the eight months ended december  income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at december  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of our earnings history 
net loss net loss for the eight months ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the eight months ended december   due to investments in technology  marketing and expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues and volumes loan volume increased by million  or  to  million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a significant increase in the number of loans funded through our mortgage banking subsidiaries  volume attributable to acquired operations  and significant refinancing activity stimulated by relatively low interest rates 
refinancings accounted for of our loan volume in fiscal  compared to in fiscal revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the incremental volume of funded loans from mical and increased volumes of originated loans generated by our interloan 
com website  both of which were purchased in the first quarter of fiscal loans originated by mortgage brokers and funded by us accounted for million in additional revenues  or of the increase for the year 
loans we originated  most of which were funded by other lenders  accounted for million in additional revenues  or of the increase for the year 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from an increase in direct costs associated with increased volumes of funded loans from the purchase of mical  increased indirect production expenses from the purchases of the interloan

additionally  we maintain communications with such purchasers and others from whom receivables are due and in certain circumstances  determines the allowance necessary based on agreed upon amounts 
we determine our market valuation allowance relating to mortgages held for sale and mortgages that have been sold primarily on a loan by loan basis 
the allowance is based on factors such as market values  bids received  industry loss experience and our prior loss experience  if any  as well as risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the increase in provision for losses of million  or  was attributable to the provision for doubtful accounts recorded at our mical mortgage subsidiary 
we acquired mical in a business combination accounted for as a purchase in may accordingly  the provision for doubtful accounts of mical is included in our results of operations only subsequent to the acquisition date only for fiscal  and accounts for the entire increase 
the remaining increase in the provision for losses relates to increased provisions for losses on mortgages held for sale and mortgages previously sold off balance sheet risk 
this increase was attributable primarily to our mical mortgage subsidiary but additionally to provisions for loan losses recorded by our coastal federal mortgage subsidiary 
loans originated at mical and at coastal  acquired in may and april  had risk characteristics and loss recourse provisions that were dissimilar from our risk characteristics and sale recourse provisions prior to these acquisitions 
gross profit for fiscal decreased by million to a loss of million from a profit of  in fiscal as a result of the increase in our cost of revenues

other operating expense for fiscal increased by  or  to million from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from charges recorded to value warrants issued when our convertible debentures were converted to common stock 
other interest expense other interest expense for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of amortization of the imputed interest and debt issuance costs on our convertible subordinated debentures  which were issued in march and may the debt was redeemed in january and the discount has been fully amortized 
income taxes as of april   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at april  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of our earnings history 
net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to the purchases of mical and coastal  increased marketing expenses associated with the purchase of interloan

marketing and advertising 
marketing and advertising expenses for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased advertising expenses associated with the increased level of loan fundings and the introduction of new products 
special charges 
in fiscal  we recorded special charges of million to writeoff intangible assets that we determined would no longer be employed in future operations 
depreciation and amortization

net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and office space in anticipation of growing the business  consulting expenses related to the acquisition of monument in the prior fiscal year  expenses in anticipation of the mical and coastal acquisitions  and intangible asset write downs 
financial condition december  compared to april  historically we have experienced operating losses and have relied on external sources of debt and equity financing to fund operations  to service debt and to complete acquisitions and to make capital investments 
equity increases  primarily from private placements of common stock and warrant exercises  partially offset by operating losses have increased stockholders equity to million at december  from million at april  our cash increased by million to million at december  from million at april   primarily as the result of cash received from private placements  partially offset by our use of cash to fund some of our mortgage origination activities and to make capital investments 
in addition  we recorded million of restricted cash  relating primarily to receipts from sales of mortgage loans  which could only be used to reduce warehouse borrowings 
mortgages held for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at april  this increase was due to an increase in the volume of originations late in the period and slower than expected settlements 
mortgage servicing rights decreased from million at april  to zero at december  the servicing portfolio was sold during in the eight months ended december  we received cash of million  we recorded  of additional expense in cost of revenues  and the balance due is recorded in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we expect to collect substantially all of the balance due on this sale during the six months ended june  warehouse borrowings increased million  or  from million at april  to million at december  as our loan originations increased late in the period ended december  accrued expenses increased as we increased our spending on professional services relating to the implementation of computer systems and related infrastructure 
improvement in our financial condition is dependent on our ability to significantly grow our loan origination volumes  to achieve highly efficient operating processes and procedures  and to manage warehouse interest expense and operating expenses given the level of volumes 
our financial condition is further dependent on economic conditions such as the general health of the economy and demand for mortgage loans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to improve our financial condition through profitable operations 
liquidity and capital resources the nature of the mortgage lending business requires us to advance cash on a daily basis to fund newly originated loans to our borrowers 
the majority of these funds are provided through conventional mortgage warehouse lines of credit  purchase repurchase agreements  and our cash balances 
additional cash resources  obtained primarily through private placements of our common stock and other debt and equity offerings are used to fund ongoing expenses such as administration and marketing  to invest in product development and geographic expansion  and to satisfy debt and other obligations as they come due 
currently  cash generated by operations is not sufficient to meet our operating requirements 
adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding  which permit us to fund mortgage loans  are essential to our ability to close loans through our mortgage banking subsidiaries 
we borrow money to fund our loan closings and repay these borrowings as the loans and the accompanying servicing rights are sold 
upon the sale of loans and servicing rights and the subsequent repayment of the borrowings  our credit facilities become available to fund additional loan closings 
on august  we entered into a new  million committed warehouse borrowing agreement with gmac rfc which expires on may  the new agreement replaced the existing million extended agreement 
the new facility may be used for the origination or the acquisition of mortgage loans and is secured by mortgages loans that have been funded using the facility 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest at libor plus 
as of december   million was outstanding on this facility 
the agreement contains a number of operating and financial covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a minimum current ratio  a minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
the agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability to change executive management  transfer or sell assets  rapidly grow liabilities  pay dividends  enter into transactions with our affiliates  or enter into a merger  consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets 
the events of default contained in our revolving warehouse facility are typical of facilities of its type 
at december   we were in default of our primary warehouse lending agreement  as were in violation of the liability growth covenant 
subsequent to december   the lender waived the default 
our available credit lines also include fannie mae s as soon as pooled early purchase option the asap plus program 
under the asap plus program  fannie mae funds us on the loans we deliver to them upon receipt of appropriate mortgage collateral 
fannie mae subsequently purchases the mortgage loans for cash upon receipt of complete and accurate mortgage pool and other documentation 
at december   million was outstanding on this facility 
during the eight months ended december   operating activities  including daily operating expenditures  repayment of warehouse borrowings and funding new originations  used million in cash compared to cash used by operations of million during the same period of the prior year 
investing activities used cash of million during the eight months ended december   consisting primarily of investments in property  plant and equipment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our servicing portfolio and proceeds from the sale of marketable equity securities 
we do not intend to purchase additional mortgage servicing rights 
we expect our level of capital spending for calendar to decrease somewhat as we will not incur infrastructure upgrades required for year compliance 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the eight months ended december   attributable mainly to private placements of our common stock 
we expect that cash flow from the sale of mortgage loans will increase as we intend to increase both fundings and sales through additional marketing and sales efforts in our business to business segment 
if we continue to maintain at least our current level of working capital borrowing resources  we believe that our existing cash balances and funds available under our revolving warehouse facilities and fannie mae asap program will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next months 
we do  however  expect that in the future we will need to arrange for additional sources of capital through the issuance of debt or equity or additional warehouse facilities 
we have no commitments for any additional financings  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain any such additional financing at the times required and on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in such event  our growth could slow and operations could be adversely affected 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future performance the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  which  in turn  could cause the price of our shares to decline  resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment 
we cannot predict which  if any  of these risks may actually occur  or the extent to which any occurrence  circumstance or event will actually affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  and the trading price of our shares 
because we expect continued losses in the future  our business  financial condition and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for fiscal and and the eight months ended december   respectively  and  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we cannot predict future results of operations with any degree of certainty  we expect to continue to incur losses because of the current state of the mortgage market and our plans to continue to invest in information technology  marketing and geographic expansion of our business 
while we do not believe these losses will exhaust our credit lines or available capital resources in the year ending december   we may not be able to implement our business plans  and our business  results of operations financial condition and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if our new management is not able to expand and improve our operations  our business would suffer 
since december  we have replaced most of our management team 
our new officers have not previously worked together  and we cannot be sure that they will be able to work together to improve and expand our operations 
on february   rick cossano became our president and chief executive officer replacing mark korell  who retired effective january  robert snow  became our executive vice president  business to business  on january   replacing kevin gillespie  executive vice president  sales and marketing  who resigned effective december  michael quinn will become our senior vice president  director of capital markets on april   replacing michael conway  who was terminated as executive vice president  capital markets  effective january  in addition  christos skeadas  executive vice president chief technology officer  and thomas porter  executive vice president administration have recently resigned 
if the new management team is not able to work together and improve and expand our operations  our financial condition  profitability and growth prospects would be materially adversely affected 
the loss of any of our key personnel would likely have an adverse effect our business 
we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our new senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of key employees or delay in recruiting candidates to fill our currently vacant management positions or any other key position which may become vacant could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to manage growth in our business  our results of operations may not improve 
we anticipate that we will need to expand our employee base  facilities and infrastructure in order to be able to compete successfully and take advantage of market opportunities 
if we are unable to manage the expansion of our business effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may not improve and could deteriorate 
we expect this expansion to place significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
our current personnel  systems  procedures and controls are not adequate to support anticipated growth of our operations 
to manage this expected growth  we will need to improve our mortgage processing  operational and financial systems  information processing capacity  procedures and controls 
we may be unable to hire  train  retain or manage necessary personnel  or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
if there is a further decrease in demand for mortgages  our business could suffer 
demand for mortgages is typically adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  declining demand for consumer credit  declining home sales  declining real estate values and decreased ability of borrowers to make loan payments 
these factors tend to decrease demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate and could increase the rates of delinquencies and foreclosures on loans we hold 
these changes would likely have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to differentiate ourselves from our competition in our industry  our business prospects could be harmed 
the e mortgage market is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
because the barriers to entry are minimal  we expect competition to intensify in the future 
in addition  the residential mortgage loan business is highly competitive 
we currently compete with a variety of other companies offering mortgage services  including various on line mortgage brokers  including e loan inc  iown 
com  mortgage 
com  quicken mortgage and keystroke financial  mortgage companies that offer products through on line search engines  such as yahoo and microsoft corporation s home advisor website  mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions which still originate the vast majority of mortgage loans  and mortgage brokers 
many of our mortgage banking and mortgage brokerage competitors have longer operating histories or significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
some of our on line competitors are spending substantial funds on mass marketing and branding their mortgage services 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of services and financial products to customers and have the ability to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities 
as a result  many have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases and can offer more attractive terms to customers  including more aggressive loan pricing policies 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
if we are unable to do so it will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if interest rates continue to rise  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
rising interest rates generally discourage refinancing of residential mortgages and reduce the number of new home sales 
any further increase in interest rates or an adverse change in the residential real estate market or general economic conditions  both of which are outside our control  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of interest rate changes tends to be greater on the market for refinancing loans than it is on the market for purchase loans  since refinancing a mortgage loan is voluntary and motivated primarily by a homeowner s desire to lower financing costs  whereas new home purchasers are motivated by a need or desire for a new home 
accordingly  the annual volume of new mortgage refinance loans is quite volatile 
approximately of the loans we originated and or funded during the eight months ended december  were loans to refinance mortgage debt  compared to during the eight months ended december  we cannot predict future interest rate trends  their impact on our business  or our ability to manage this business mix 
the value of the loans we make is based  in part  on market interest rates  and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if interest rates change rapidly or unexpectedly 
if interest rates rise after we fix a price for a loan but before we sell the loan into the secondary market  the value of that loan will decrease 
if we delay in selling our loans into the secondary market  our interest rate exposure increases and we could incur a loss on the sale 
while we use various hedging strategies to provide some protection against interest rate risks  no hedging strategy can protect us completely 
the nature and timing of hedging transactions influences the effectiveness of hedging strategies and poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than decrease risk 
in addition  hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs 
there is a risk that our hedging strategy and the hedges that we make will not adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and that our hedges will result in losses 
if we fail to maintain credit facilities to finance our mortgage lending activities  our growth prospects could be severely limited 
to the extent that we are unable to access adequate capital to fund loans  we may have to curtail or cease our loan funding activities entirely 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we are not a bank  we are dependent upon specialized mortgage credit facilities from other lenders to finance our mortgage lending activities 
in august  we entered into a million committed warehouse borrowing agreement with gmac rfc which replaced an existing million agreement with gmac rfc 
in the agreement  which expires on may   we make numerous representations  warranties and operating and financial covenants 
a material breach by finet 
com of any of these representations  warranties or covenants could result in the termination of the agreement and an obligation to repay the entire amount outstanding under the agreement 
in the past  we have had to obtain waivers from gmac rfc s for defaults under the agreement 
at december   we were in default of our primarily warehouse lending agreement  as we were in violation of certain financial and other covenants 
subsequent to december   the lender waived the defaults 
during january  the defaults were cured 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able obtain a waiver of from gmac rfc of any future defaults  should they occur  or that financing will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change in e commerce and improve our products and services  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the internet and e commerce are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render existing technology and systems obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully use new technologies effectively or adapt our websites  technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  we will not remain competitive and our business  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to attract qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our ability to grow and our future success depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service and professional personnel 
competition for such employees is intense  especially in the e commerce sector  and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
if we fail to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service personnel and experienced professionals  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if consumers and mortgage broker businesses do not embrace on line mortgage financing and sales  our business would be materially adversely affected 
our success depends upon the acceptance of on line mortgage financing by consumers  mortgage brokers and other real estate service providers 
if the market for on line mortgage financing fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if there are insufficient communications services to support the internet  it could result in slower response times which would adversely affect usage of the internet 
even if use of the internet for on line financing gains acceptance  we may be unable  for technical or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements in a timely manner  and such products and services and enhancements may not gain widespread market acceptance 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if there is a recession  natural disaster or other disruption in the california economy  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we are particularly vulnerable to recessions and conditions affecting the california economy 
of the loans we originated and or funded in the eight months ended december   were for properties located in california 
no other state represented more than of our closed loans during such period 
while we expect to expand our business in other states  a concentration of loans in california is likely to continue for the foreseeable future 
there have been times in the past  most recently in and  when the california economy suffered a recession more severe than the rest of the country 
if such a recession were to occur again  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  california historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters  such as earthquakes and mudslides  which are not typically covered by standard hazard insurance policies 
these natural disasters often result in increased loan delinquencies or defaults which could adversely effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we have to repurchase loans originated for or sold to lenders  our results could be materially adversely affected 
there is a risk that we will not have sufficient funds to repurchase loans upon demand or that such repurchases will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
under agreements with some of our lenders  they may require us to repurchase loans that we originate for them  or they purchase from us  in the event of material misrepresentations by us or inaccuracies in the borrowers loan documents 
in the eight months ended december   our coastal federal mortgage  mical mortgage and monument mortgage subsidiaries were required to repurchase approximately  million and  principal amount of loans  respectively 
it is possible that future demands will be made to purchase loans originated and sold by these subsidiaries 
as of december   we held approximately  aggregate principal amount of loan in foreclosure 
as a result of repurchases  we occasionally are required to hold foreclosed residential real estate in inventory until it can be resold 
future foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if interest rates rise and the economy declines  the rate of mortgage loan foreclosures may rise 
depending on the circumstances of the transaction  we may or may not be able to sell the property for more than the outstanding loan balance 
problems and risks related to potential acquisitions and alliances may harm our business 
to implement our growth strategy we may acquire or enter into alliances with companies with complementary services  technologies and businesses 
in connection with any such acquisition  we may fail to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
for example  as described more completely below under we may incur additional losses from the discontinued operations of coastal federal mortgage and mical mortgage  we incurred significant losses following our acquisitions of mical mortgage and coastal federal mortgage  and they have discontinued their operations 
any future alliances we pursue may not be successful 
also  acquisitions or alliances could divert our management s attention from other business matters  or we could lose key employees of acquired companies or alliance businesses 
the discontinuation of federal programs that purchase loans or any change in our eligibility to participate in such programs would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if the mortgage programs administered by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae or our eligibility to participate in them were terminated or significantly curtailed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we fund our mortgage loan operations in part by selling the mortgage loans that we fund to these mortgage programs which pool the loans into mortgage backed securities 
our ability to sell mortgage loans depends upon the continuation of programs administered by these entities  as well as our continued eligibility to participate in these programs 
we also depend upon private mortgage investors  such as gmac rfc  ge capital mortgage and indymac  to purchase mortgage loans that we originate which do not qualify for inclusion in the federal programs described above 
if private investors reduce their purchases of these mortgage loans  the market and price for such mortgage loans will be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae s desktop underwriter  freddie mac s loan prospector  gmac rfc s assetwise and ge capital mortgage s good decisions 
these services help ensure that our mortgage services can be offered efficiently and timely 
we currently have an agreement with fannie mae that allows us to use their automated underwriting services and enables us to sell them qualified first mortgages 
we expect to continue to process a significant portion of our conforming loans using the fannie mae system 
however  our agreements with fannie mae and other mortgage investors can be terminated by either party at any time 
there is a risk that we will not remain in good standing with fannie mae and other mortgage investors or that fannie mae and other mortgage investors will terminate our relationship 
the termination of our agreement with fannie mae would materially adversely impact our ability to originate loans 
we may incur additional losses from the discontinued business of coastal federal mortgage and mical mortgage 
in april  we acquired coastal federal mortgage  and in may  we acquired mical mortgage inc our results of operations include net losses from the acquisitions of both of these units and from their operating activities 
although these business units were discontinued in april  they may incur additional losses  which would be included in our consolidated results 
we reported net losses associated with coastal and mical during fiscal and for the eight months ended december  of million and million  respectively 
if our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly  the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to continue to vary substantially from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the following fluctuations in interest rates  seasonal or other economic factors affecting demand for mortgages  changes in our pricing policies or our competitors pricing policies for mortgage origination and processing fees  the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  the level of consumer interest and confidence in the internet as a means of accessing financial products and services  any termination or restructuring of agreements with key service providers  and technical difficulties or service interruptions affecting our internet websites or operational data processing systems 
fluctuation in our quarterly results may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
we anticipate that as the on line mortgage origination industry matures  our business will also be increasingly susceptible to the same seasonal and cyclical factors that affect the mortgage industry as a whole 
accordingly  we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and our results for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our operating results may fail to meet our expectations or those of analysts who follow us 
any such failure could cause our stock price to decline substantially 
our stock price could be highly volatile 
the trading prices of internet and e commerce stocks have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of internet and e commerce companies 
the valuations of many internet and e commerce stocks are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
these trading prices and valuations may not be sustained 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce companies could further depress our stock price regardless of our future results 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following declines in the market price of their securities 
if litigation of this type were brought against us  it could be very costly and could divert management s attention and resources from our business 
if there are interruptions or delay in obtaining appraisal  credit reporting  title searches and other underwriting services from third parties  we may experience customer dissatisfaction and difficulties closing loans 
if we are unsuccessful in securing the timely delivery of ancillary services such as appraisals  credit reporting and title searches  we will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on other companies to perform certain aspects of the loan underwriting process  including appraisals  credit reporting and title searches 
if the provision of these ancillary services were interrupted or delayed  it could cause delays in the processing and closing of loans for our customers 
the value of the service we offer and the ultimate success of our business are dependent on our ability to secure the timely provision of these ancillary services by the third parties with whom we have business relationships 
if we fail to comply with extensive federal and state laws regulating our industry  we could be subject to penalties  disqualifications  lawsuits or enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state authorities 
if we fail to comply with such regulations  possible consequences could include loss of approved status  demands for indemnification  class action lawsuits  administrative enforcement actions and other civil and criminal sanctions  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business mortgage banking regulation  at page of our annual report on form k for the year ended april  if our computer systems fail  our business would be materially adversely affected 
any interruption in the availability of our websites  transaction processing systems or network infrastructure could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
such interruptions could result from events such as fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  computer viruses and electronic breaches 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of a failure of our computer systems or other interruptions in our business 
our websites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information  the accuracy and timeliness of which is critical to our business 
in the past  we have experienced periodic system interruptions  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our websites will require us to expand and upgrade further our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our websites or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  on line service providers and other website operators for access to our websites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outage delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
moreover  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
any of these problems would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our electronic security devices are breached  our business would be materially adversely affected 
if any compromise in our security devices were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the secure transmission of confidential information through e commerce is critical to our underwriting process 
we rely on certain encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information  such as consumers financial statements 
there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect transaction data 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet generally  and e commerce in particular 
to the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as consumers financial statements and profile information  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that a failure to prevent such security breaches will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our shares our delisted  the liquidity for our shares could be impaired 
in december  we received notice from nasdaq that we had not met required financial ratio criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq 
nasdaq requested that we maintain a minimum net worth of million and submit to nasdaq certain periodic financial reporting until july we have complied with nasdaq s special reporting request and required ratio criteria 
if we fail to meet the nasd s continued listing requirements  including  among others  net tangible assets or market capitalization  minimum bid price and various corporate governance requirements  our shares could be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in such event  trading  if any  in our common stock would thereafter be conducted in the over the counter markets in the so called pink sheets or the nasd s electronic bulletin board 
consequently  the liquidity of our shares could be impaired  not only in the number of shares which could be bought and sold  but also through delays in the timing of the transactions  reductions in the number and quality of security analysts and the news media s coverage of the company  and lower prices for our shares than might otherwise be attained 
if our shares are delisted  our shares could become subject to the sec s penny stock rule 
if our shares were delisted from nasdaq  they could become subject to rule g under the securities exchange act of  which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers which sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally  individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual incomes exceeding  or  together with their spouses 
for transactions covered by this rule  a broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
consequently  the rule may adversely affect the ability of broker dealers to sell our shares and may adversely affect the ability of purchasers in this offering to sell any of the securities acquired in the secondary market 
if our shares become subject to this rule  market liquidity for our shares could be severely adversely affected 
year compliance in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as as result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information and technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately  during the eight months ended december  in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
material subsequent events effective january   we appointed robert snow  executive vice president business to business

conway initiated arbitration proceedings in which it is alleged that he was wrongfully terminated 
a mediation is scheduled to resolve the matter 
effective february   thomas porter  our executive vice president administration  resigned 
effective march   christos skeadas  our executive vice president chief technology officer  resigned 
effective april   we have appointed michael quinn  senior vice president  director of capital markets 
as of december   our growth and change in chief executive officers violated certain covenants in our primary warehouse lending agreement 
subsequent to december   the lender waived the defaults 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk finet s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk 
from the time we extend an interest rate commitment to the borrower until the loan is priced for sale to an investor  we are subject interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise during that period  the price at which the loan can be sold to an investor declines  resulting in a lower sales price for the loan 
we attempt to mitigate such reductions and manage our interest rate risk exposure through hedging transactions using a combination of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and forward whole loan sales to fix the sales price of loans we expect to fund 
before entering into hedging transactions  we analyze our loans with committed interest rates pipeline loans 
we consider factors such as the estimated portion of loans that will ultimately be funded  note rates  interest rates  inventory of loans and applications and other factors to determine the type and amount of forward commitment and hedging transactions 
finet attempts to make forward commitments for  or hedge substantially  all of its estimated interest rate risk on the loans 
we have mandatory and optional forward commitments at december  and april  and aggregating million  million and million  respectively 
these commitments covered the market risk associated with mortgage loans held for sale to investors of million  million and million  respectively  and our pipeline loans for which interest rates were committed at december  and april  and of million  million and million  respectively 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure on forward sales arrangements by entering into forward sales contracts exclusively with institutions that we believe are sound credit risks and by limiting exposure to any single institution
