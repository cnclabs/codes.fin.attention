the change in inventory along with increases in deferred lease payments and increased depreciation as a result of aircraft purchases were the primary contributors in improving operating cash flow 
in late  the company incurred additional fuel expense due to rising fuel prices that have carried over into on february   a fuel surcharge was implemented on passenger tickets that partially mitigates future effects of the company s higher fuel costs 
if the company maintains its current aircraft fleet  aircraft maintenance materials and repairs expense is expected to trend higher in the next few years as the fleet ages 
raytheon is the company s primary aircraft supplier and largest creditor 
the company has financed all of its beechcraft aircraft and one of its brasilia aircraft under related lease and debt agreements with raytheon  and raytheon has also provided a million working capital line of credit payable on demand and a million short term loan  payable on demand  and collateralized by beechcraft spare parts and equipment and accounts receivable

the line of credit agreement is effective through december  the line of credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which require the company to maintain minimum levels of tangible net worth and remain current on all other outstanding debt obligations  among other matters 
the credit facility also limits additional indebtedness  capital expenditures and dividends 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at the inception of the agreement 
in connection with entering into this revolving credit facility  the company paid raytheon million on the short term loan and entered into an agreement  whereby  raytheon would receive certain aircraft parts as payment for the remaining line of credit balance 
effective august   the company restructured its raytheon aircraft agreements 
the restructuring resulted in a total of beechcraft aircraft under operating leases of various terms with monthly lease payments ranging from  to  per aircraft 
the restructuring also cured all of the defaults with raytheon

at this time  management expects that cash on hand  internally generated cash flow  and borrowings available under credit agreements will be adequate to meet the company s operating and recurring cash needs for foreseeable periods 
year impact before the rollover of the year from to  many installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit date entries and were unable to accept four digit date entries to distinguish st century dates from the th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies prior to the rollover date required upgrading or replacement to comply with such year requirements 
the failure of the company  its vendors  suppliers or other critical third parties with whom the company conducts business to achieve year compliance on a timely basis could materially adversely affect the company s business 
as of april   the company has not experienced and does not anticipate any material adverse effects on its systems and operations as a result of year issues 
business is continuing as usual  and internal systems will continue to be monitored for any likely disruptions 
further  as of april   the company has not experienced any operational difficulties as a result of year issues with its vendors  suppliers or other critical third parties with whom the company conducts business 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be not assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not year compliant 
although the transition to the year did not have any significant impact on the company or its systems and operations  the company will continue to monitor the impact of year on its systems and those of its vendors  suppliers and other critical third parties 
the contingency plan s that were developed for use in the event of year related failures will be maintained and generalized for ongoing business use 
the company has not spent  and does not anticipate spending in the future  any material amounts relating to year issues 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and all hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness 
for derivatives that qualify as effective hedges  the change in fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects earnings 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments  or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument  the change in fair value will affect current period earnings 
at december   the company had no derivative instruments 
this statement will become effective for the company for the first quarter ended march  frequent flyer program the company s united express passengers may earn miles in united s mileage plus and frequent flyer program  and passengers may use mileage accumulated in this program to obtain discounted or free tickets for trips that might include a flight segment on one of the company s flights 
no revenues are earned or collected on free tickets awarded to passengers under the program 
awards earned under the frequent flyers program have an expiration date three years from the date earned 
the program also contains certain restrictions  including blackout dates and capacity controlled bookings  which substantially limit the use of awards on certain flights and during the busiest periods 
the company continually monitors the number of free travel award reservations on its flight segments to ensure that they are within the capacity restrictions defined in the mileage plus program 
the company s yield management program and related seat restrictions minimize the number of revenue passengers that may be displaced on any individual flight segment 
to date  the company has not experienced any material use of mileage plus and awards to obtain travel on flights  and the incremental cost to the company attributable to the exercise of frequent flyer awards consisting primarily of a minimal amount of additional gate and passenger service expenses has not been material 
awards used on the company s flights during the year ended december  represented approximately percent of the company s total passengers 
the company expects that this percentage will remain approximately the same for the foreseeable future 
based on this low percentage  the availability on many of the company s flights of otherwise vacant seats  and on the program s restrictions  the company believes that the displacement  if any  of revenue passengers by users of mileage plus and awards will not become material 
the company continually monitors the number of awards redeemed and will accrue the incremental costs associated with the mileage plus and program if they become material 
effects of inflation in late  the company incurred additional fuel expense due to rising fuel prices that carried over into cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of cautionary factors the company wishes to caution shareholders and prospective investors that the following important factors  among other identified in this annual report on form k  could affect the company s actual operating results  and that such results could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose

dependence on relationship with united the company generated approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  under the united express agreements described under business united express relationship 
the united express agreements expired on december  a failure to renew the united express agreements  any termination or materially adverse modification of the agreements  or any substantial decrease in the number of routes served by the company under the agreements would have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
as a result of the united express agreements  the company s business is sensitive to events and risks affecting united 
if adverse events affect united s business  the company s business will also be adversely affected 
the united express agreements require the company to comply with specific operating performance standards and  with certain limited exceptions  restrict the ability of the company to merge with another company or dispose of its assets or aircraft without first offering united a right of first refusal to acquire the company or such assets or aircraft 
the united express agreements also prohibit the company from entering into similar arrangements with other carriers in chicago  denver  minneapolis st 
paul  detroit  des moines or omaha without united s prior approval 
the united express agreements require the company to obtain united s prior consent to operate as a united express carrier in any market  except for certain pre approved markets connecting with minneapolis st 
paul or detroit 
effect of general economic conditions the airline industry is significantly affected by general economic conditions 
during recent recessions  most airlines reduced fares in an effort to increase traffic 
economic and competitive conditions in the airline industry have contributed to a number of bankruptcies and liquidations among airlines 
a worsening of current economic conditions  or an extended period of recession nationally or regionally  would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
fuel costs fuel is a major component of operating expense for all airlines 
the company s cost of fuel varies directly with market conditions  and the company has no guaranteed long term sources of supply nor has it hedged the cost of its fuel needs at this time 
during late and early  the industry  including the company  experienced increased fuel prices 
the company intends generally to follow industry trends by raising fares in response to significant fuel price increases 
however  the company s ability to pass on increased fuel costs through fare increases may be limited by economic and competitive conditions 
accordingly  a reduction in the availability or an increase in the price of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on the company s cash flow from operations and profitability 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced lower passenger volumes during the months of january through april and in november and december 
this seasonality can be attributed primarily to relatively difficult winter weather operating conditions in the company s principal area of operations  resulting in fewer vacations and other discretionary trips and reduced business travel during these months 
these seasonal factors have generally resulted in reduced revenues  increased operating losses and reduced cash flow for the company during these months
