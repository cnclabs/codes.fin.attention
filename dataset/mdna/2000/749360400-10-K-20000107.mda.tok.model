depreciation and amortization increased  or million  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions completed during fiscal and the company currently amortizes goodwill  defined as the excess of the company s acquisition costs over the net assets of the businesses it acquires  on a straight line method over a period of years 
the company periodically reviews the net realizable value of its intangible assets  including goodwill  through an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets 
management reviews each business unit to which these intangible assets relate to determine whether the anticipated future cash flows from that business unit over the estimated useful life of its intangible assets are expected to provide for recovery of the assets 
if management believes that the intangible assets are being carried at amounts in excess of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  then the intangible assets are adjusted for impairment to a level commensurate with management s discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying assets 
the financial accounting standards board the fasb is considering amending its opinions  or adopting one or more new opinions  to require goodwill purchased in a business combination to be amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life  not to exceed years 
the amended or adopted opinions may be made effective as of a date prior to the date of such amendment or adoption 
if the fasb takes such action  the company will  with respect to acquisitions which close after the effective date of any amended or new opinions  amortize its acquisition related goodwill over a period of years rather than years  and correspondingly increase its charge for amortization over the applicable periods 
although the adoption of any such amended or new opinions would not change the business operations of the company  the goodwill carried on the company s balance sheet  and its results of operations  would be affected materially
