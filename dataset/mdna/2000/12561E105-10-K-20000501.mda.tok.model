item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and selected financial and operating data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a leading nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants  operating principally under the carl s jr  taco bueno and hardee s brand names 
based on domestic systemwide sales  our hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the fourth and seventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states  respectively 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated restaurants 
the carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated  restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s are located throughout the eastern and midwestern united states  predominantly in the southeast 
as of january   our taco bueno chain consisted of quick service mexican restaurants in texas and oklahoma  of which were operated by us and one was operated by a licensee 
we derive our revenues primarily from sales by company operated restaurants and revenues from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenues from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
operating costs of our franchised and licensed restaurants include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
s franchisees and licensees  lease payments on properties subleased to our franchisees and the costs of equipment purchases 
other operating expenses  including advertising expenses and general and administrative expenses  relate to company operated restaurants as well as franchisee and licensee operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  of franchised and licensed restaurants 
factors affecting comparability of fiscal years  and our fiscal year results in a fifty third week every five or six years 
fiscal includes weeks of operations 
fiscal and include weeks of operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded pre tax charges of million million after tax 
these charges consisted of a establishing a million store closure reserve and recording a million asset impairment charge for hardee s restaurants which we plan on closing within the next months  b recording an impairment charge and equity losses of million to write down our various long term investments in other restaurant concepts to fair market value  c recording million of restructuring charges in connection with consolidating certain administrative functions from rocky mount  north carolina  to anaheim  california  d writing off million of deferred financing costs as a result of a commitment decrease in our senior credit facility  e writing off million of year yk costs associated with restaurant computer systems  f writing off million of capitalized software development that will not be utilized  g recording an additional million in vacation expense in connection with a change in vacation policy  h recording a gain on the sale of carl s jr 
and hardee s restaurants of million and i other miscellaneous net adjustments of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge to write down our investment in boston west and recognized a gain of million on the sale of our star buffet  inc star buffet investment 
in addition  in fiscal  we reversed approximately million of allowances for certain hardee s franchisee note receivables as the previously established amounts proved to be unnecessary 
we currently operate hardee s to carl s jr 
converted restaurants in texas  oklahoma and kansas and our franchisees operate eight hardee s to carl s jr 
converted restaurants in oklahoma 
operating results for these restaurants for fiscal are included in the carl s jr 
financial information 
in fiscal and prior  these restaurants operating results are included in the hardee s financial information 
we believe our acquisitions of hardee s in july and fei in april allowed us to significantly expand the scope of our operations and to become one of the leading nationwide operators of quick service hamburger restaurants 
because of the significant effect of the acquisitions of hardee s and fei on our results of operations  our historical results of operations and year to year comparisons will not be indicative of future results and may not be meaningful 
operating results of hardee s and fei are included in our results of operations from july  and april   respectively 
we acquired taco bueno and certain other restaurant concepts in fiscal  and our results of operations for fiscal  and include million  million and million  respectively  of revenues generated by these restaurants

as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants and other 
fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal compared with fiscal revenues company operated restaurants 
revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to billion in fiscal as compared with fiscal a large part of this increase in revenues is the inclusion in fiscal of an extra week of operating results as compared with fiscal carl s jr  hardee s and taco bueno company operated restaurant revenues for the year accounted for sales increases of million  million and million  respectively  offset in part by the decrease in revenues from our jb s restaurants and galaxy diner restaurants which were sold to sbrg in september same store sales for our company operated carl s jr 
restaurants decreased for fiscal  but were positive for the fourth quarter of fiscal our company operated hardee s restaurants experienced a same store sales decrease of  while same store sales for our company operated taco bueno restaurants increased  marking the fifth consecutive annual increase in same store sales 
we believe that the increase in revenue from our company operated carl s jr 
restaurants can be primarily attributed to an increase in the number of restaurants open and operating in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  offset in part by the decline in same store sales  the continuation of our conversion of existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants  the addition of several new sandwiches  including the spicy chicken sandwich  the sourdough bacon cheeseburger and the sourdough breakfast sandwich  and the inclusion of million of revenue from the hardee s to carl s jr 
converted restaurants in fiscal that had been included in the hardee s results of operations in fiscal taco bueno s increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the addition of new taco bueno restaurants open and operating in fiscal and the image enhancement program for the chain  which began in fiscal the revenue increase from our hardee s restaurants was driven by including a full year of operations of the fei restaurants and other franchised restaurants acquired during fiscal  offset  in part  by the revenues from the hardee s to carl s jr 
restaurants that were included in hardee s results for fiscal  but are reflected in carl s jr 
results of operations beginning in fiscal we attribute much of the decrease in same store sales at hardee s to our previous advertising strategy  which was not successful in promoting the hardee s brand 
the harsh weather experienced in the southeast during the third quarter of fiscal  including the effects of hurricane floyd  and the january storms in the southeast during fourth quarter were also contributing factors 
average unit volumes at our company operated carl s jr 
and hardee s restaurants ended the fiscal year at  and  respectively 
average unit volumes at our company operated taco bueno restaurants continue to rise and increased to  as of fiscal year end 
revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to billion in fiscal as compared with fiscal carl s jr 
company operated restaurant revenues for the year accounted for sales increases of million 
our hardee s and taco bueno restaurants contributed million and million  respectively  to the increase 
partially offsetting these increases was the decrease in revenues from our hometown buffet and casa bonita concepts  which were disposed of in connection with the initial public offering of star buffet in september  and our jb s restaurants and galaxy diner restaurants which were sold to sbrg in september on a same store sales basis  our carl s jr 
sales increased  and our taco bueno sales increased  marking the fourth consecutive annual increase in same store sales for both chains 
same store sales for our company operated hardee s restaurants decreased 
the overall increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants was primarily the result of our continued focus on promoting great tasting new and existing food products through increased advertising  the continuation of our conversion of existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants  the image enhancement of our restaurants through a chain wide remodeling program which was completed in december  and an increase in the number of company operated restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with fiscal taco bueno s increase in revenues is due in part to a new advertising campaign  which also focuses on great tasting food products  and the system wide installation of new menu boards and all you can drink beverage bars 
in fiscal  we also began an image enhancement program for our taco bueno restaurants and are focusing on real estate that is better located and more heavily trafficked than the properties previously targeted for new taco bueno restaurants 
the revenue increase from our hardee s restaurants was also driven by including a full year of operations of the restaurants initially acquired in july and by our acquisitions of fei and other franchised restaurants during fiscal we attribute much of the decrease in same store sales at hardee s to menu deletions  as well as our discontinuation of promotional discounting and monthly new product introductions 
the particularly harsh weather experienced in the southeast and midwest during the fourth quarter of fiscal was also a contributing factor 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
our revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants for fiscal increased million  or  to million over fiscal this revenue increase was mainly due to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees as a result of an increase in the number of carl s jr 
franchised restaurants operating in fiscal as compared with fiscal and an increase in equipment sales to hardee s franchisees in connection with the remodeling of hardee s restaurants to the star hardee s format 
also contributing to the increase was the inclusion of million in franchise fees from the sale of company operated carl s jr 
and hardee s restaurants to franchisees in fiscal offsetting this increase in part was the loss of royalty revenue from our jb s franchised restaurants  which were sold to sbrg in september our revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants for fiscal increased million  or  to million over fiscal this increase is principally due to the addition of a full year of royalties earned by hardee s franchise system and a full year of equipment sales to hardee s franchisees  offset in part by the conversion of certain hardee s franchised restaurants into company operated restaurants  including our purchase of fei in april a large part of the increase can also be attributed to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees as a result of higher sales volume at franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants and the increase in the number of carl s jr 
franchised restaurants operating in fiscal as compared with fiscal operating costs and expenses restaurant operations 
restaurant level operating margins of our consolidated restaurant operations decreased in fiscal by to as compared with fiscal  primarily as a result of establishing a million store closure reserve and asset impairment charge for of our hardee s restaurants which we plan to close within the next months 
depreciation and amortization expense also increased in fiscal as a result of new unit development of our carl s jr 
and taco bueno chains  restaurant remodels at hardee s and taco bueno and upgrades to our computer systems and applications in connection with our effort to fully integrate our recent restaurant acquisitions 
excluding the expense relating to the hardee s store closure reserve and asset impairment charge  consolidated restaurant level margins would have been for fiscal consolidated restaurant level margins increased in fiscal by to as compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting the improvement in operating margins at each of our three core concepts and the disposal of our remaining higher cost family style restaurant concepts in the third quarter of fiscal combined pressures in commodity costs  labor costs  the introduction of the lower priced product offerings and increased depreciation expense as a result of the new carl s jr 
restaurants opened in fiscal all contributed to the decrease in the chain s restaurant level margins in fiscal to as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants from in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the operating results of the hardee s to carl s jr 
conversion restaurants which were included in hardee s operating results prior to fiscal  carl s jr 
restaurant level operating margins for fiscal were 
the increase in operating margins in fiscal over fiscal reflects our increased purchasing synergies for food and paper  improved labor productivity and reduced workers compensation costs 
our carl s jr 
food and packaging costs as a percentage of company operated revenues increased to in fiscal following a decrease of in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased commodity prices for beef and cheese as well as a shift in the product mix resulting from high sales levels of the spicy chicken sandwich  which was introduced in the third quarter of fiscal  contributed to the increase in food and paper costs 
during fiscal food costs decreased due to the purchasing economies our carl s jr 
chain achieved as a result of the consolidated buying power directly realized from our addition of other restaurant concepts  partially offset by increased pressure from commodity prices and a change in the product mix as a result of the promotion of larger  more expensive sandwiches such as the charbroiled sirloin steak sandwich  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal payroll and other employee benefits for our carl s jr 
restaurants increased to as a percentage of company operated revenues in fiscal from a fairly consistent level in prior years of and for fiscal and  respectively 
the overall tighter labor market has impacted our average hourly wage rate and increased competitive pressures in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
the increase in the number of our carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants also contributed to the rise in payroll and employee benefit costs due to the more labor intensive nature of the green burrito system 
further  we made a conscious decision to add additional employee hours to improve guest service at the restaurants 
during fiscal  the september federal and march california minimum wage increases contributed to the rise in payroll and employee benefit costs 
offsetting the impact of these partial year increases was the savings resulting from the continuation of labor productivity programs implemented in prior fiscal years to decrease costs further and improve direct labor efficiencies 
carl s jr 
occupancy and other operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was largely a result of additional depreciation expense on the new units built during fiscal and increased repair and maintenance expense at the restaurants as the number of years grows since our last remodel program 
also increasing occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is the inclusion in fiscal of the hardee s to carl s converted restaurants 
these restaurants revenues are lower than the carl s jr 
system  therefore fixed costs as a percentage of revenues are higher 
the decrease in occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company operated restaurants in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  is largely due to our efforts to maintain costs at the prior fiscal year levels in conjunction with the fixed nature of the expenses and the increase in revenues in fiscal hardee s company operated restaurant level margins for fiscal  excluding the million store closure reserve and asset impairment charge  were  as compared with in fiscal and in fiscal although hardee s restaurant level operating margins are substantially lower than our carl s jr 
and taco bueno quick service restaurant concepts and despite the decrease in restaurant level margins from fiscal  we have increased operating margins at hardee s from for those restaurants open and operating as of december   the year prior to our acquisition 
we have accomplished this reduction of costs through many of the same cost saving measures we implemented at our carl s jr 
restaurants over the past four to five years  including the introduction of the carl s jr 
labor matrix to refine labor usage  a focus on safety and accident prevention as a method of lowering workers compensation costs  the reduction of food waste and theft tolerance levels  and the use of purchasing synergies to lower food and paper costs 
additionally  the simplification of the hardee s menu and conforming hardee s depreciation policies also contributed to the increase in restaurant level operating margins since we acquired it 
hardee s food and packaging costs as a percentage of company operated revenues increased during fiscal by to and decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal this fiscal increase was due mainly to special promotional discounts and an increase in commodity prices 
partially offsetting the fiscal increase  and contributing to the decrease in fiscal  were the effects of a reduction in food waste and theft tolerance levels and continued purchasing economies achieved as a result of our increased consolidated buying power 
payroll and other employee benefits  as a percentage of revenues from company operated hardee s restaurants  increased to in fiscal and decreased in fiscal to from fiscal this increase in payroll and other employee benefits in fiscal is primarily a result of the increased labor required in the remodeled star hardee s restaurants and higher average hourly wage rates as a result of a tighter labor market 
the decrease in labor from fiscal to fiscal is mainly a result of the introduction of the carl s jr 
labor matrix to refine labor usage and a focus on safety and accident prevention as a method of lowering workers compensation costs 
as a percentage of revenues from hardee s company operated restaurants  occupancy and other operating expenses increased to in fiscal over the fiscal and levels of and  respectively 
the percentage increase in occupancy and other operating expenses in fiscal is due primarily to the fixed nature of the costs combined with a decrease in the same store revenue base  as well as increased depreciation costs in connection with remodeling restaurants to the star hardee s format during fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we provided a store closure reserve at hardee s of million for hardee s restaurants that we plan on closing over the next months 
the store closure reserve represents a liability for the net present value of any remaining lease obligation after the expected closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
additionally  a related provision for asset impairment of million was recorded to reduce the carrying amount of these restaurants assets million and goodwill million to amounts projected to be recovered by the individual restaurants operating cash flows over the restaurants estimated remaining period of operation 
the provision for restaurant asset impairment is net of amounts expected to be recovered  if any  from the sale of such assets upon the closure of the store 
taco bueno s restaurant level operating margins for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal in fiscal  taco bueno s restaurant level margins increased to from fiscal the decrease in fiscal was mainly a result of increases in commodity costs for meat and cheese  a change in packaging materials used and an increase in workers compensation costs as a result of a revaluation of our historical worker s compensation experience rating 
these decreases in restaurant level margins for fiscal were partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and operating expenses  which is due  in large part  to the fixed nature of these costs in combination with the increased revenue base at our taco bueno restaurants 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the fixed nature of occupancy and other operating expenses combined with an increase in revenues  as well as the savings achieved from implementing some of the same labor productivity programs successfully implemented at our carl s jr 
restaurants in the past four to five years 
offsetting these benefits in fiscal was the negative impact of the increased commodity costs for cheese and tomatoes and increased lease expense for the new point of sale equipment installed in all of our taco bueno restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurant and other costs increased to million in fiscal over fiscal and to million in fiscal over fiscal these increases are primarily due to increased food and other products purchased from us by carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees and increased equipment purchases from us by hardee s franchisees and licensees 
as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants  these costs increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  as compared with fiscal and  respectively 
while royalties from hardee s franchised and licensed restaurants decreased during fiscal as a result of the repurchase of several of hardee s franchised restaurants including fei  revenues from equipment sales to hardee s franchised and licensed restaurants increased 
the cost structure associated with equipment sales is much higher than that associated with the royalty stream of income 
while carl s jr 
earns its income from both royalties paid and food purchases by franchisees  hardee s earns a higher percentage of its franchised restaurant revenue from royalties paid because its franchisees purchase food  supplies and other products from independent vendors and distributors 
as a result  the cost structure associated with the hardee s franchise operations is substantially lower than that associated with the carl s jr 
franchise operations 
consequently  these costs as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal due to including a full year of hardee s operating results in fiscal advertising expenses 
advertising expenses increased million in fiscal over fiscal  and million in fiscal over fiscal  principally due to increased advertising support for hardee s 
advertising has become increasingly important in the current competitive environment  and  as a result  advertising expenses have increased in terms of dollars spent and as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and as compared with the prior fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal over fiscal and million to million in fiscal over fiscal general and administrative expenses were  and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
this increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflects the planned addition of regional general and administrative expenses in the fei markets that did not exist in the prior year  including additional quality assurance and regional human resources support  higher training expenses for the accelerated star hardee s remodel rollout  a full year of fei goodwill amortization expense  and an increase in information technology costs associated with the implementation of our new computer system 
also impacting general and administrative expenses in fiscal are million of charges  including a million of restructuring charges in connection with consolidating certain administrative functions from rocky mount  north carolina to anaheim  california  b million of yk expenses associated with restaurant computer systems  c million in capitalized software development costs which were written off because they will not be utilized  d million in additional vacation expense in connection with a change in our vacation policy  e gain on the sale of an aircraft that we acquired in connection with the original hardee s acquisition  and f million in other miscellaneous credits 
after adjusting for these items  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of total revenues 
on november   we announced that we would consolidate the majority of the corporate functions of our hardee s subsidiary  located in rocky mount  north carolina  within our corporate headquarters in anaheim  california  creating a single support and administration center for our carl s jr  hardee s and taco bueno restaurants 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we accrued million of termination benefits for approximately employees we will be laying off between mid january and august we paid million to approximately employees who were involuntarily terminated in january such amounts were charged against the severance reserve which is included as part of other current liabilities 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal in terms of dollars spent is primarily the result of the added expense of supporting hardee s restaurant operations 
general and administrative expenses also increased in fiscal due to recording incentive compensation accruals for regional restaurant management and selected corporate employees for improved operating performance 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal over fiscal also reflects the economies of scale we realized by absorbing certain costs associated with fei into our existing infrastructure 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million to million as compared with fiscal the increase is due to higher levels of borrowings outstanding and an increase in interest rates under our senior credit facility  a full year of interest expense on our million  convertible subordinated notes in fiscal as compared with fiscal  and the issuance of our million  senior subordinated notes in the first quarter of fiscal  the net proceeds of which we used to pay down our senior credit facility which carried a lower rate of interest 
also increasing interest expense in fiscal was the write off of million of deferred financing costs associated with a commitment decrease in our senior credit facility 
interest expense for fiscal increased million to million as compared with fiscal due to higher levels of borrowings outstanding  including the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of fiscal  and the assumption of capital lease obligations as a result of the acquisitions of hardee s in july and fei in april as a result of the amendment to our senior credit facility subsequent to year end  the applicable margin used to determine our interest rate payable on outstanding borrowings was increased 
as such  we would expect to see our interest expense rise in future quarters even if our borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility remain unchanged 
however  we plan to mitigate the effect of higher interest rates by reducing outstanding borrowings with proceeds from sales of restaurants 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  mainly consists of interest income  lease income  dividend income  gains and losses on sales of restaurants  income and loss on long term investments  property management expenses and other non recurring income and expenses 
other income expense  net in fiscal was an expense of million 
in fiscal  charges of million were recorded during the fourth quarter 
these charges include a recording an impairment charge and equity losses of million to write down our investments in checkers which merged with rally s in august  sbrg  and boston west to fair market value based upon our conclusion that these investments have experienced an other than temporary decline in value  b recording a gain on the sale of carl s jr 
and hardee s restaurants of million  and c writing off approximately million of hardee s acquisition related assets which we believe to have no future benefit 
excluding these charges  other income expense  net was an expense of million  an increase of million as compared with the fiscal expense of million 
the increase in expense in fiscal  after adjusting for these charges  was largely due to a reduction in interest income as a result of our reduced note receivable from checkers  the settlement of certain claims against us relating to our investment in boston west and the recognition of lease income from boston west in the prior year 
other income expense  net decreased million in fiscal over the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a million charge to our investment in boston west  offset in part by a non recurring gain of million resulting from the disposition of our investment in star buffet 
decreases in lease  dividend and interest income  as well as larger losses recorded from our investment in rally s have also contributed to the overall decrease in fiscal extraordinary item during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved the buyback of up to million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
in fiscal and fiscal  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of such notes for million and million in cash  respectively  including accrued interest thereon 
in connection with this repurchase  we recognized an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of and million  net of applicable income taxes of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
impact of inflation inflation has an impact on food  construction  occupancy  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect our operations 
historically  we have been able to pass any higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to our customers because those factors have affected nearly all restaurant companies 
during fiscal   and  however  we have emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the price competitiveness of the quick service restaurant industry 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our other restaurant concepts  the weather has a greater impact on average restaurant sales at our hardee s restaurants  because a significant number of them are located in rural areas that experience severe winter conditions without the benefit of municipal storm services typical of more urban areas 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million in fiscal in fiscal  we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  compared with million in fiscal this decrease was mainly due to the continued decrease in same store sales at our hardee s restaurants  combined with a decreases in operating margins at all of our restaurant concepts and increased interest expense 
investing activities absorbed million of our cash to fund capital additions of million 
partially generating some of the funds necessary for these investments were the proceeds of million from the sale of property and equipment to our franchisees and million from collections on and sale of notes receivable  related party receivables and leases receivable 
financing activities provided us with million in cash  primarily from a net increase of million in long term borrowings 
cash flows from operating and financing activities were mainly used to fund the remodeling of our hardee s restaurants to the star hardee s format  to build new carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants  to pay million of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes  to repay million in capital lease obligations  to purchase million of our common stock and to pay dividends of million 
exercises of stock options and the related tax benefit provided us with an additional million 
on march   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repay outstanding term loan balances under our senior credit facility 
the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes imposes certain restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  incur liens on our assets  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business  or enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 
the senior subordinated notes represent unsecured general obligations subordinate in right of payment to our senior indebtedness  including our senior credit facility 
in connection with our private placement of senior subordinated notes  we also amended and restated our senior credit facility to increase the lenders commitments under our revolving credit facility to million from million 
we also increased our letter of credit sub facility to million from million  and changed the maturity date of the senior credit facility to february the term loan component of the senior credit facility was eliminated as a result of these transactions 
borrowings under the senior credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including permitted investments and acquisitions 
we will be required to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility with the proceeds from certain asset sales  the issuance of certain equity securities  and the issuance of additional indebtedness 
of the various options we have regarding interest rates  we have selected libor plus a margin  with future margin adjustments dependent on certain financial ratios from time to time 
our senior credit facility contains the following significant covenants restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on our assets  subject to specified exceptions  requirements that we satisfy specified financial tests as a precondition to our acquisition of other businesses  and limitations on making capital expenditures and certain restricted payments including dividends and repurchases of stock subject in certain circumstances to specified financial tests 
in addition  we are required to comply with minimum ebitda requirements  minimum interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirements and maximum leverage ratios 
in november  we amended our senior credit facility to modify certain of the covenants therein for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and for future measurement periods 
in addition  the revolving commitments under the senior credit facility were reduced to million from million and were to be further reduced by the first million in proceeds from sales of restaurants 
the final maturity date of february remained unchanged  however  the applicable margin used to determine the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowings was increased and up to million of revolving borrowings will be converted  subject to lender approvals  to term borrowings with an interest rate not subject to adjustment on the basis of certain financial ratios 
the term loan component will provide for principle payments of million each quarter  beginning in march  with all remaining principle due on the maturity date 
on april  we further amended our senior credit facility effective january   to amend certain of the covenants contained therein 
the amended senior credit facility also provides that the revolving commitments thereunder shall be reduced by the first million in net proceeds from sales of restaurants as compared with million in the november amendment and of the second million in net proceeds from sales of restaurants  and by the entire net proceeds from the sale of any of our carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants 
the senior credit facility  as amended  prohibits us from purchasing shares of our common stock  purchasing our senior subordinated notes or convertible subordinated notes  from prepaying subordinated indebtedness and from increasing cash dividends paid from current levels 
in addition  capital expenditures were reduced and construction of new restaurants is limited to construction already begun or committed to begin 
the final maturity date still remains unchanged  however  the interest rate payable on outstanding borrowings was increased 
failure to complete an asset sale or sales aggregating million in net proceeds by the end of october will result in a further increase in the interest rate until such sales are completed 
we were in compliance as of january  with all of our covenants related to our senior credit facility  as amended 
our primary source of liquidity is our revenues from company operated restaurants  which are generated in cash 
future capital needs will arise primarily for the construction of new carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants  the remodeling of our hardee s restaurants to the star hardee s format  the remodeling of existing taco bueno restaurants  the conversion of restaurants to the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand concepts and capital expenditures to be incurred in connection with our previously announced restructuring and consolidation of administrative functions from rocky mount  north carolina to anaheim  california 
we intend to increase our proportion of franchised restaurants to company operated restaurants 
we are planning to sell up to hardee s restaurants to existing and new franchisees in fiscal  which should generate proceeds of approximately million 
these sales contemplate additional development within the given markets and the related agreements will require that the hardee s restaurants receive the star hardee s remodel 
in almost all cases  these agreements require full royalties at four percent of net sales 
the net proceeds from these asset sales will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the quick service restaurant business generally receives simultaneous cash payment for sales 
we presently use the net cash flow from operations to repay outstanding indebtedness and to reinvest in long term assets  primarily for the remodeling and construction of restaurants 
normal operating expenses for inventories and current liabilities generally carry longer payment terms usually to days 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets 
we believe that cash generated from our various restaurant concept operations  along with cash and cash equivalents on hand as of january   and amounts available under our senior credit facility  will provide the funds necessary to meet all of our capital spending and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
as of january   we had million of borrowings available to us under our senior credit facility 
if those sources of capital  together with net proceeds from sales of restaurants  are insufficient to satisfy our capital spending and working capital requirements  we may be required to sell additional restaurants or obtain additional credit facilities 
in addition  substantially all of the real properties we own and use for our restaurant operations are unencumbered and could be used by us as collateral for additional debt financing or could be sold and subsequently leased back to us 
in the event that our hardee s restaurants do not show improvements in same store sales or our carl s jr 
restaurants were to experience declines in same store sales  and if we are unable to generate proceeds from the sale of restaurants at prices and on terms sufficient to service our senior credit facility  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity in order to avoid short and long term liquidity shortage 
the availability of capital resources will depend upon prevailing market conditions  interest rates and our then existing financial position 
year our operational  information and financial systems successfully handled the transition into year all restaurants were fully functional and open for business on january  no communication interruptions were identified with any third party suppliers or vendors 
although no yk related problems are anticipated  we are continuing to monitor all systems throughout the first quarter of fiscal we are currently involved in a comprehensive program to upgrade computer systems and applications in connection with our effort to fully integrate our recent restaurant acquisitions 
total expenditures related to the upgrade of the information systems are expected to range from to million and will be capitalized or expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
through january   we have capitalized approximately million of internal staff costs and outside consulting and other expenditures related to this upgrade process 
during fiscal  we incurred million in costs associated with making our carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurant computer systems yk compliant 
these costs were included in general and administrative expenses 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of capitalized software development costs that we determined will not be utilized in the future 
item a
