item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the past three fiscal years for sgi have seen declining revenues and unprofitable operations as we have felt the impact of technologies and product families in transition  management and employee turnover and strong competition 
during fiscal  we took several major steps to refocus our operations  including the spin off of our majority interest in mips  the sale of our cray product line  and the discontinuance of our proprietary silicon graphics registered trademark and visual workstation product line in favor of products based on industry standard architectures 
we also continued to manage significant reductions in operating expenses compared with fiscal levels 
while these steps are all important parts of our plan to restore growth and profitability  in the short term they had a pronounced impact on our fiscal financial results  which makes the comparison of these results to those for prior years difficult 
the discussion that follows is limited to a discussion of the historical results of operations and financial condition

total revenue is principally derived from three reportable segments servers  visual workstations and global services  which were determined based on factors such as customer base  homogeneity of products  technology  delivery channels and other factors 
total revenue in fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal and fiscal revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal these decreases primarily reflect the maturity of our current origin brand scalable server product line for which new products were introduced in the beginning of fiscal  the sale of our cray product line in fiscal and continuing trends in the declining unix workstation and vector supercomputer markets which are part of our visual workstation and server segments  respectively 
the following table presents the percentage of total revenue by reportable segment years ended june numbers may not add due to rounding in millions servers   of total revenue visual workstations of total revenue global services of total revenue other of total revenue fiscal server revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease primarily reflects lower revenue within our origin brand scalable server business due to a mature product line for which the next generation origin family of high performance servers were introduced in the first quarter of fiscal  coupled with continuing declines in the supercomputer market 
our onyx registered trademark graphics systems revenue also declined during fiscal compared with fiscal  due to a mature product line for which the next generation onyx family of graphics systems were introduced in the first quarter of fiscal we also believe both our origin and onyx server revenue were adversely impacted by manufacturing process issues that delayed delivery of our r tm megahertz processors 
we began receiving shipments of these processors during the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  the cray product line  including product and service revenue  represented less than of total revenue 
on march   sgi completed the sale of its cray product line 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  sale of cray product line  for further information 
fiscal server revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal although our fiscal origin brand scalable server business returned to growth in fiscal  our cray branded business declined significantly 
as we exited fiscal  this business represented less than of total revenue 
our onyx graphics system revenue declined in fiscal  but the rate of decline slowed in fiscal to compared with in fiscal fiscal visual workstation revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal and fiscal visual workstation revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal these decreases reflect the effects of strong competition in the shrinking unix workstation market and the disappointing sales performance of our visual workstations based on the windows nt operating system introduced in the second half of fiscal in light of the disappointing sales performance of our proprietary architecture silicon graphics and visual workstations  we decided to discontinue this product family in favor of products with more industry standard architectures 
in light of this transition  we recorded charges to cost of revenue during fiscal related to these products 
see gross profit margin and operating expenses 
global services revenue is comprised of hardware and software support and maintenance  professional services and remanufactured systems sales 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or less than compared with fiscal and fiscal global services revenue increased million or compared with fiscal the slight decrease in global services revenue for fiscal reflects a decline in our traditional customer support revenue  offset in part by the impact of our investment in our professional services business as well as increases in the level of our remanufactured systems business 
growth in global services revenue in fiscal reflects the impact of our investment in our professional services business  as well as increases in the level of our remanufactured systems business 
other revenue is principally comprised of our operating units that are not reportable segments  including the product and service revenue of our software subsidiary  alias wavefront 
in addition  revenue from mips  an operating unit that develops and markets microprocessors and related intellectual property  which was a majority owned subsidiary until sgi distributed its interest in mips to its shareholders through a spin off effective june   is also included in other revenue 
for both fiscal and fiscal  revenue from mips represented less than of total revenue 
total revenue by geographic area for fiscal  and was as follows in millions area americas    europe rest of world total revenue    geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal  and was as follows area americas europe rest of world the increase in rest of world business in fiscal primarily reflected increased sales in japan as a percentage of total revenue 
our consolidated backlog at june  was million  down from million at june  the decline primarily reflects the sale of our cray product line  the discontinuance of our silicon graphics and visual workstations and the continuing decline in our unix workstation market  offset in part by an increase in our professional services business 
gross profit margin cost of product and other revenue includes costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  overhead and other direct or allocated costs involved in their manufacture or delivery 
costs associated with non recurring engineering revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of service revenue includes all costs incurred in the support and maintenance of our products  as well as costs to deliver professional services 
our overall gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal and our fiscal gross profit margin increased compared with our fiscal gross profit margin of 
gross profit margin for fiscal included certain adjustments related to our silicon graphics and visual workstations 
product gross margin reflects charges of approximately million for third party manufacturing contract cancellations and purchase commitments and for excess product and demonstration inventory related to our silicon graphics and visual workstations 
during fiscal  we also charged million to cost of service revenue for future unrecoverable visual workstation support costs 
in addition  we recorded a million charge to cost of service revenue for estimated warranty related costs associated with the cray t tm supercomputer product line and million for the write down of excess spares 
without these adjustments  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been  representing a decrease of percentage points  compared with the corresponding period of fiscal in addition  for fiscal  the cray product line  including product and service cost of revenue  represented less than of total cost of revenue which accounted for less than percentage point of the decline in gross profit margin year over year 
on march   sgi completed the sale of its cray product line 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  sale of cray product line  for further information 
gross profit margin for fiscal included a number of non recurring charges related to refocusing our supercomputer product roadmap  as well as a write down of excess spares 
without those charges  our fiscal gross profit margin would have been 
mips was a majority owned subsidiary until sgi distributed its remaining interest in mips to its stockholders through a spin off effective june  excluding the results of mips  our fiscal overall gross profit margin would have decreased from to 
our gross profit margin over the past three years reflects decreased volumes and continuing pricing pressures in both the server and visual workstation segments  as well as in our global services business 
we have been able to partially mitigate these effects by consolidation and outsourcing of certain manufacturing operations and continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and procurement practices 
operating expenses in millions research and development of total revenue selling  general and administrative  of total revenue other of total revenue our total fiscal operating expenses decreased million compared with fiscal and fiscal operating expenses decreased million compared with fiscal included in fiscal  and results are approximately million  million and million  respectively  of direct operating expenses related to cray that  as a result of the sale of the cray product line  will not be incurred on a go forward basis 
included in fiscal   and results are approximately million  million  and million of direct operating expenses related to mips that  as a result of the distribution of our interest in mips to our stockholders  will also not be incurred on a go forward basis 
fiscal and fiscal operating expenses included million of restructuring charges and million of restructuring  long lived asset impairment and merger related charges  respectively 
research and development research and development spending decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal and decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects reductions in our investment in windows nt based visual workstation development as we transition to more industry standard architectures  as well as reductions in our investment in unix workstation development as the market for unix workstations continues to shrink 
decreases year over year were also noted in our investments in scalable servers and graphics systems as we completed development and introduced the next generation of these products in early fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects reductions in investments in vector supercomputer and unix workstation development 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increased investments in scalable server and windows nt based visual workstation development 
we expect research and development spending in fiscal to decline as a result of the sale of the cray product line and the spin off of our majority interest in mips 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal and decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects the impact of the current year restructuring actions including lower compensation expense  reduced occupancy costs and overall general expense control 
marketing expenses decreased significantly  particularly in corporate programs 
the fiscal decrease reflects the impact of the restructuring actions taken in fiscal  as well as lower selling commissions due to lower revenue  reduced outside consulting and business process re engineering costs  continued focus on productivity and general expense controls 
marketing expenses decreased significantly as well  particularly in corporate and vector supercomputer programs 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include a number of non recurring charges  including a million write down of certain capitalized internal use software deemed obsolete as a result of changes in strategic direction 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal to decline compared with fiscal other operating expense other operating expense for fiscal represents a charge for estimated restructuring costs of million 
other operating expense for fiscal includes a million reduction to the restructuring costs we estimated at the end of fiscal other operating expense for fiscal consists of restructuring charges of million  a charge for impairment of long lived assets of million and merger related expenses of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  other operating expense  for further information regarding these activities 
interest and other interest expense interest expense declined in fiscal compared with fiscal and declined in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a reduction in long term borrowings of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we do not expect a significant change in the level of interest expense in fiscal interest income and other  net interest income and other  net includes interest income on our cash investments  gains and losses on other investments  the minority interest in the earnings of mips and other non operating items 
interest income and other  net for fiscal decreased million from fiscal and decreased million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal was primarily due to a loss on the sale of our cray product line  non recurring costs associated with the spin off of mips  a decrease in interest income due to significantly lower cash balances and the minority interest in mips earnings  offset in part by the write down of investments in certain technology companies in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal was primarily due to the write down of investments in certain technology companies  the minority interest in mips earnings and other non operating items 
we expect a decline in the level of interest income based on anticipated lower cash investments in fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes although we incurred a loss for fiscal  we made a provision for income taxes totaling million 
included in this provision was million in taxes currently payable in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and a charge of million related to our change in investment policy of no longer permanently investing accumulated earnings attributable to certain foreign affiliates which manufacture in foreign jurisdictions 
we intend to utilize such earnings to satisfy liquidity requirements in the us and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
also included in this provision was a million increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which  due to the distribution of mips in a manner that was tax free for sgi in the fourth quarter of fiscal  no longer met the realizability criteria under sfas no 
offsetting these charges was a reduction of million in previously provided income tax reserves related to certain exposures that were no longer necessary given the increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was  excluding the impact of the mips gain and a change in previously estimated restructuring costs  which were tax effected at 
the effective tax benefit rate for fiscal was 
the fiscal benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses for which no benefit was recognized 
the fiscal benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses for which no benefit has been recognized  the write off of acquired in process technology and goodwill for which there was no tax benefit and the establishment of reserves for certain deferred tax assets not expected to be realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and amended it in march and june sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements for all public registrants 
changes in our revenue recognition policy  if any  resulting from the interpretation of sab would be reported as a change in accounting principle 
we are currently reviewing the impact of sab on our previously reported results of operations and anticipate that we will adopt sab during the fourth quarter of fiscal in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
fin clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
with respect to stock related compensation 
fin is effective july  management does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of sgi 
financial condition at june   cash and cash equivalents and marketable and restricted investments totaled million compared with million at june  included in the balance at june  and june  is approximately million and million  respectively  of restricted investments that serve as collateral for letters of credit and an equity forward purchase agreement 
operating activities used million in cash for fiscal  compared with providing million in fiscal and million in fiscal to present cash flows from operating activities  net loss income for each of the past three years had to be adjusted for certain significant items that did not either provide or use cash 
included in these fiscal adjustments is a million increase in our valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax asset and a million charge related to repatriating accumulated foreign earnings 
partially offsetting these charges is a million reduction in previously provided income taxes related to certain exposures that were no longer necessary given the increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
fiscal net income is adjusted to remove the impact of the million gain on the sale of a portion of our interest in mips stock that is reflected as a cash flow from investing activities and million in non cash charges for the write off of investments in certain technology companies 
fiscal net loss is adjusted for a million non cash charge for long lived asset impairment  a million non cash charge for the write off of purchased intangibles and goodwill resulting from the disposal of paragraph international inc paragraph and a million non cash charge for the write down of excess spares 
in addition to the adjustments noted above  the negative operating cash flow in fiscal was partially due to approximately million in cash payments for severance  contractual obligations and facilities obligations related to restructuring activities 
these activities are expected to result in future cash outlays of approximately million  the majority of which will occur in fiscal and will be funded through current working capital 
negative operating cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable attributable to lower revenue levels and continued improved collections 
aside from the adjustments noted above  operating cash flow in both fiscal and was positive primarily due to our focus on asset management that resulted in significant reductions in accounts receivable and inventories which generated million and million  respectively  in cash 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  consumed million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was for the acquisition of capital equipment and our election to exercise an option to purchase five buildings on our mountain view campus for approximately million that had been held under an off balance sheet financing arrangement 
in addition  cash was reduced by million as a result of the spin off of mips which is no longer included in our consolidated balance sheet 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments and the mips transactions  consumed million in cash during fiscal and million in fiscal  principally for the acquisition of capital equipment and spare parts 
fiscal investing activities also used million to fund a portion of our investment in waminet inc financing activities over the past three years have included the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and option plans and repurchases of common stock 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock to mitigate the dilutive effect of the stock plans 
since commencement of this repurchase program in we have repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million 
we utilize equity instrument contracts to facilitate the repurchase of common stock and  at june   we have outstanding commitments to buy an aggregate of million shares of common stock for aggregate consideration of million under our equity forward purchase arrangement 
at june   million shares remain available for purchase under this program 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments of million 
other sources of liquidity include equity investments and financeable real estate 
for example  during the first quarter of fiscal we sold substantially all of our investment in va linux systems  inc va linux for net proceeds of million 
for the remaining investment in va linux  we entered into a derivative contract that guarantees minimum net proceeds of million and matures on december  we believe that these principal sources of liquidity  along with cash generated from operations  and other resources available to us  should be adequate to fund our projected cash flow needs 
we believe that the level of financial resources is an important competitive factor in the computer industry and  accordingly  we may elect to raise additional capital through either debt or equity financing or the sale of non strategic assets in anticipation of future needs 
risks that affect our business sgi operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of these risks 
business transition 
sgi has had declining revenue and has been unprofitable on an operating basis for each of the past three fiscal years 
our plan to restore growth and profitability will require significant transitions in product strategy and in operating expenses 
we have announced product roadmaps for both the server and workstation businesses that will  over the next five years  supplement our products based on the mips processor architecture with products based on the intel processor architecture  and from the irix operating system to linux and windows nt 
this process will involve our supporting both architectures indefinitely in order to provide flexibility and support to our customers 
risks associated with this strategy include uncertainty among employees  customers and partners  potential customer defection and higher operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will introduce the new products required for these transitions as planned  successfully support our customer and partner base as they adopt these new products or otherwise manage this process in a way that will allow us to recover from this uncertainty 
new products 
in the last quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of we introduced major new products in every segment of our computer system business  including the origin server family  new graphics subsystems both in our workstation and our onyx graphics server families  and new intel based workstations and servers 
our ability to meet our objectives for fiscal is highly dependent on the success of these new products  and on our success in ramping these new products to commercial volumes as scheduled 
while we had recorded approximately million in orders for origin and other new products as of june   our ability to fulfill these orders in the first half of the year will require that we resolve issues regarding various industry wide and world wide supply constraints  including  in particular constraints on the ceramic packaging for many of our asics 
expense reduction program 
while our operating expenses  excluding other operating expenses  have declined from billion in fiscal to billion in fiscal and to billion in fiscal  our expenses remain out of line with our revenues  and we expect that we will be taking additional steps in fiscal to address this issue while our objective is to reduce our costs in ways that will not have a material impact on revenue levels  there is no assurance that this will be achieved 
dependence on partners and suppliers 
our business has always involved close collaboration with partners and suppliers 
however  many elements of our current business strategy  including the longer term transition to the intel architecture and additional outsourcing of manufacturing  will increase our dependence on intel and other partners  and on our manufacturing partners and other component suppliers 
our business could be adversely affected  for example  if intel fails to meet product release schedules  or if unanticipated quality issues arise with products from suppliers 
the competitiveness of our system products  particularly our servers  is significantly affected by the availability on our platform of third party software applications that are important to customers in our target markets 
our ability to work with our software partners to ensure porting of these applications to our irix operating system and  in the future  to linux  is a key factor to our business success 
employees 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel  who are in great demand 
the uncertainties surrounding sgi s business prospects have increased the challenges of retaining world class talent 
we have initiated hiring and retention programs to attract and retain key employees  but there is no assurance that these programs will succeed 
product development and introduction 
our continued success depends on our ability to develop and rapidly bring to market technologically complex and innovative products 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of a new computer system requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design teams  internal and external manufacturing teams  outside suppliers of key components such as semiconductor and storage products and outsourced manufacturing partners 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish 
there is no assurance that acceptance of our new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
as noted above  our ability to successfully attract and retain key technical  marketing and management personnel in a competitive hiring environment has a direct impact on our ability to maintain our product development timetables 
short product life cycles place a premium on our ability to manage the transition to new products 
we often announce new products in the early part of a quarter while the product is in the final stages of development  and seek to manufacture and ship the product in volume during the same quarter 
our results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products to manufacturing late in any quarter  quality or yield problems experienced by suppliers  variations in product costs and excess inventories of older products and components 
in addition  some customers may delay purchasing existing products in anticipation of new product introductions 
period to period fluctuations 
our operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
delivery cycles are typically short  other than for large scale server products 
a little over half of each quarter s product revenue results from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
because we plan our operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including lower than expected demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions or natural disasters 
demand can also be adversely affected by product and technology transition announcements by sgi or our competitors 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale server products may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations  including geographic concentrations  the mix of product and service revenue  and the mix of server and desktop product revenue including the mix of configurations within these product categories 
our results have typically followed a seasonal pattern  with stronger sequential growth in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  reflecting the buying patterns of our customers 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on our stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
competition 
the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
most of our competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources and  in some segments  a larger installed base of customers and a wider range of available applications software 
competition may result in significant discounting and lower gross margins 
impact of government customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to the us government  either directly by us or through system integrators and other resellers 
sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers  including potential disruptions due to appropriation and spending patterns and the government s reservation of the right to cancel contracts for its convenience 
a portion of our business requires security clearances from the united states government 
we have implemented measures to maintain our clearances in light of the fact that our ceo  mr 
robert bishop  is not a united states citizen 
however  these arrangements are subject to customer review and approval and periodic review by the defense security service of the department of defense 
any disruption or limitation in our ability to do business with the united states government could have an adverse impact on sgi 
export regulation 
our sales to foreign customers are subject to export regulations 
sales of many of our high end products require clearance and export licenses from the us department of commerce under these regulations 
the departments of commerce and justice are currently conducting civil and criminal investigations into sgi s compliance with the export regulations in connection with several export sales to tier countries 
we believe that these matters will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on our business 
however  there is no assurance that these matters will not have an unforeseen outcome that could impair the conduct of our business with the us government or our sales outside the united states 
our international sales would also be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened  or if they are not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of our products 
intellectual property 
we routinely receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering our products and technologies 
based upon our evaluation  we may take no action or may seek to obtain a license 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available on terms that we consider reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
we expect that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as competition in the markets we address intensifies  the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  as well as collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses in these areas 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and cash equivalents  marketable investments  short term and long term debt and all derivative financial instruments 
currency forward contracts and currency options constitute our portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compute the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
we selected the discount rates used for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at june  and we computed the market values for foreign exchange risk based on spot rates in effect at june  and the market values that result from these computations are compared to the market values of these financial instruments at june  and the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june  and are as follows interest rate risk a percentage point decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million and million at june  and  respectively 
a percentage point increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates with the exception of asia where a strengthening in exchange rates was used for only against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june   and an increase in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  a weakening of foreign currency exchange rates with the exception of asia where a weakening in exchange rates was used for only against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june   and a decrease in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  due to the increased volatility in fiscal  the financial instruments denominated in asian currencies were tested with a strengthening and weakening 
as the foreign currency exchange rates in asia stabilized in fiscal  we performed the test with only a fluctuation 
the financial instruments measured in the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis are used in our hedging program to reduce our overall corporate exposure to changes in exchange rates to an immaterial amount
