item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic film  aluminum extrusions and vinyl extrusions 
we also have interests in a variety of technology based businesses 
descriptions of our businesses and interests are provided on pages our manufacturing businesses are quite different from our technology interests 
our manufacturing businesses can be analyzed and valued by traditional measures of earnings and cash flow  and because they generate positive ongoing cash flow  they can be leveraged with borrowed funds 
our technology operating companies  molecumetics and therics  are drug research and delivery start up companies 
each generates operating losses and negative cash flow in the form of net r d expenditures 
neither has licensed products to date  and revenues consist entirely of collaboration revenues r d support payments 
they may never generate profits or positive cash flow 
if they were stand alone  independent operations they would typically be financed by private venture capital 
our venture capital investments represent high risk stakes in technology start up companies  primarily in the areas of internet and information technologies  communications and life sciences 
our primary objective in the venture capital area is to generate high after tax internal rates of return commensurate with the level of risk involved 
in summary  we have a variety of business interests with dramatically different risk profiles  which makes the communication of operating results more difficult  especially since we only have one class of stock 
as a result  the segment information presented on pages  and the business segment review on pages  is critical to the understanding of our operating results and business risks 
on september   we announced that our board of directors is evaluating alternative financing and structural options for the technology group tredegar investments  molecumetics and therics 
these options are still being studied 
results of operations versus revenues 
net sales in increased by over due primarily to acquisitions

see note on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products  however  those changes are generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices but are also generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices  however  there is no assurance that higher ingot costs can be passed along to customers 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 
we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants

we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign operations in emerging markets have agreements with certain customers that index the pricing of our products to the us dollar  the german mark or the euro 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations in europe primarily relates to the german mark and the euro 
we believe that our exposure to the canadian dollar has been substantially neutralized by the us dollar based spread the difference between selling prices and aluminum costs generated from canadian casting operations and exports from canada to the us the acquisition of exxon films on may   has increased the proportion of assets located in the us it has also increased the amount of operating profit earned in the us  partially offset by higher us dollar interest expense on higher debt related to the acquisition 
we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have recently registered shares in initial public offerings 
the portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility 
furthermore  publicly traded stocks of emerging  technology based companies have higher volatility and risk than the us stock market as a whole

the pooled irr for the venture capital industry reported by venture economics thomson financial securities data venture economics was for the five years ended september   for the years ended september   and for the years ended september  irr is the discount rate that equates the net present value of investment cash inflows with investment cash outflows 
the irr is calculated as an annualized compounded rate of return using actual investment cash flows  modified to incorporate our share of the current valuation of unliquidated holdings and operating expenses and taxes in case of the after tax irr 
the pooled irr for the venture capital industry was computed by venture economics from the combined cash flows and net asset values of all venture capital funds in their database as if the funds were one portfolio 
these are pre tax returns and computed on the same basis as tredegar s pre tax irr 
however  it is important to note that the predominant structure for private venture capital funds is the limited partnership  which  unlike corporations  is not subject to income taxes 
as a result  the after tax irr for most private venture capital funds is equal to the funds pre tax irr 
our portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility
