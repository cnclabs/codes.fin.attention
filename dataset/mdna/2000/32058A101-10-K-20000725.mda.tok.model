overview the company is a consumer finance company engaged in both the purchase of receivables originated by franchised automobile dealers and originating loans directly to consumers in connection with the sale of new and late model used vehicles

at april   the company had a network of  franchised dealers in states from which it regularly purchases receivables at the time of origination 
the company also maintained alliance partnerships with a large regional bank and an internet market firm from which it receives referral applications for credit consideration 
while the company intends to continue to geographically diversify its receivables portfolio  approximately of receivables held for investment at april  represent receivables acquired from dealers or originated to consumers located in texas 
from its inception in through october  the business strategy of the company was to purchase  pool and sell receivables to third party investors and to recognize gains associated with those sales on a current basis 
in november  the company decided that it could achieve a more stable and predictable income stream through acquiring and retaining receivables for net interest income recognized over the life of the receivables 
the primary element in this strategy is access to institutional financing in sufficient magnitudes and at rates enabling the company to purchase significant volumes of receivables and retain them at a funding cost allowing an adequate net interest margin between portfolio yield and cost of funds 
through the utilization of flexible secured credit facilities and comprehensive credit insurance  the company has been able to access financing on terms permitting it to implement this strategy and to pursue it successfully through the present time 
management believes that continued pursuit of this strategy will enable the company to sustain its growth and maintain a stable earnings stream on a relatively conservative basis 
therefore  since november  the primary source of the company s revenues has been interest income from receivables retained as investments  while its primary cost has been interest expense arising from the financing of the company s investment in such receivables 
the profitability of the company during this period has been determined by the growth of the receivables portfolio and effective management of net interest income and fixed operating expenses

the company intends to increase its acquisition of receivables by expanding its dealer base in existing states served  by expanding its dealer base into new states  by generating additional loan volume through alliances with major banks and by increasing direct to consumer lending 
to the extent that the company s receivables acquisitions exceed the extinguishment of receivables through principal payments  payoffs or defaults  its receivables portfolio and interest income will continue to increase

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash flows 
the company s business requires significant cash flow to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to acquire receivables from dealers and fund required reserve accounts  ii amounts necessary to fund premiums for credit enhancement insurance or other credit enhancement required by the company s financing programs  and iii amounts necessary to fund costs to retain receivables  primarily interest expense and servicing fees 
the company also requires a significant amount of cash flow for working capital to fund fixed operating expenses  primarily salaries and benefits 
the company s most significant cash flow requirement is the acquisition of receivables 
the company paid million for receivables acquired to be held for investment for compared to million in the company funds the purchase price of receivables through a combination of three warehouse facilities 
the firc credit facility generally permits the company to borrow up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed million 
the fiacc commercial paper facility generally allows the company to borrow up to of the outstanding principal balance of the receivables  but not to exceed million 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility at the option of the company

additionally  the company has transferred receivables from the warehouse credit facilities and issued term notes 
substantially all of the company s receivables are pledged to collateralize these credit facilities and term notes 
the company s most significant source of cash flow is the principal and interest payments received from the receivables portfolios 
the company received such payments in the amount of million in and million in such cash flow funds repayment of amounts borrowed under the firc credit and commercial paper facilities and other holding costs  primarily interest expense and servicing and custodial fees 
during fiscal years and  the company required net cash flow  respectively  of million and million cash required to acquire receivables held for investment net of principal payments on receivables to fund the growth of its receivables portfolio 
the company has relied on borrowed funds to provide the source of cash flow to fund such growth 
capitalization 
since the change in business strategy to retaining receivables in november  the company has financed its acquisition of such receivables primarily through two related credit facilities 
the company s equity was not a significant factor in its capitalization until the completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
however  the company expects to continue to rely primarily on its credit facilities to acquire and retain receivables 
the company believes its existing credit facilities have adequate capacity to fund the increase of the receivables portfolio expected in the foreseeable future 
while the company has no reason to believe that these facilities will not continue to be available  their termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations if substitute financing on comparable terms was not obtained 
firc credit facility 
the primary source of acquisition financing for receivables held for investment has been through a syndicated warehouse credit facility agented by bank of america 
the firc credit facility currently provides for maximum borrowings  subject to certain adjustments  up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed the current facility limit of million 
borrowings under the firc credit facility bear interest pursuant to certain indexed variable rate options at the election of the company or any other short term fixed interest rate agreed upon by the company and the lenders 
the company bases its selection of the interest rate option primarily on its expectations of market interest rate fluctuations  the timing and the amount of the required funding and the period of time it anticipates requiring the funding prior to transfer to the fiarc commercial paper facility 
the firc credit facility provides for a term of one year  matures september   at which time the outstanding principal balance will be payable in full  although there are provisions allowing the company a period of six months to refinance the facility in the event that it is not renewed 
borrowings under the firc credit facility were  and  at april  and  respectively 
the company is currently in discussions with its lenders regarding the renewal and extension of this facility 
management considers its relationship with the lenders under this facility to be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not be renewed 
if the facility was not renewed however  or if material changes were made to its terms and conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
fiarc commercial paper facility 
the company has indirect access to the commercial paper market through a million commercial paper conduit facility with enterprise funding corporation enterprise  a commercial paper conduit managed by bank of america 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility by transferring a specific group of receivables to a discrete special purpose financing subsidiary and pledging those receivables as collateral 
receivables are generally transferred from the firc credit facility to the fiarc commercial paper facility to refinance them on a longer term basis at interest rates based on commercial paper rates and to provide additional borrowing capacity under the firc credit facility 
borrowings under this commercial paper facility bear interest at the commercial paper rate plus 
the current term of the fiarc commercial paper facility expires on august  if the fiarc commercial paper facility were terminated  no new receivables could be transferred from the firc credit facility to enterprise  however  the then outstanding receivables would continue to be financed until fully amortized

fiacc commercial paper facility 
on january   fiacc entered into a million commercial paper conduit facility with vfcc  a commercial paper conduit administered by first union national bank  to fund the acquisition of additional receivables generated under certain of the company s financing programs

the maximum borrowings available under the facility are million 
the company s interest cost is based on vfcc s commercial paper rates for specific maturities plus 
in addition  the company is required to pay periodic facility fees of on the unused portion of this facility 
as collections are received on the transferred receivables  they are remitted to a collection account maintained by the collateral agent for the fiacc commercial paper facility 
from that account  a portion of the collected funds are distributed to vfcc in an amount equal to the principal reduction required to maintain the advance rate and to pay carrying costs and related expenses  with the balance released to the company 
in addition to the advance rate  fiacc must maintain a cash reserve as additional credit support for the facility 
there were no outstanding borrowings at april  at april   borrowings were  under the fiacc commercial paper facility

acquisition facility 
on october   the company  through its indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  fifs acquisition funding company llc fifs acquisition  entered into a million non recourse bridge financing facility with vfcc  an affiliate of first union national bank  to finance the company s acquisition of fisc 
contemporaneously with the company s purchase of fisc  fisc transferred certain assets to fifs acquisition  consisting primarily of i all receivables owned by fisc as of the acquisition date  ii fisc s ownership interest in certain trust certificates and subordinated spread or cash reserve accounts related to two asset securitizations previously conducted by fisc  and iii certain other financial assets  including charged off accounts owned by fisc as of the acquisition date 
these assets  along with a million cash reserve account funded at closing serve as the collateral for the bridge facility 
the facility bears interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus 
under the terms of the facility  all cash collections from the receivables or cash distributions to the certificate holder under the securitizations are first applied to pay fisc a servicing fee in the amount of on the outstanding balance of all owned or managed receivables and then to pay interest on the facility 
excess cash flow available after servicing fees and interest payments are utilized to reduce the outstanding principal balance on the indebtedness 
in addition  one third of the servicing fee paid to fisc is also utilized to reduce principal outstanding on the indebtedness 
the bridge facility expires on july  the company is currently negotiating with first union to refinance the acquisition facility over an extended term sufficient to amortize the outstanding balance of the indebtedness through collections of the underlying receivables and trust certificates 
it is anticipated that the permanent financing will consist of issuing various tranches of notes  to be held by vfcc  which will contain distinct principal amortization requirements and interest rates 
the company anticipates no material change in the weighted average interest rate under the permanent financing 
it is anticipated  however  that a partnership will be created to purchase fifs  acquisition assets and issue the notes 
the partnership interests will be held by the company and first union and will enable the partners to share excess cash flow generated from the remaining assets 
the amount of excess cash to be received by first union will vary depending upon the timing and amount of such cash flows 
to the extent that the facility is not finalized prior to the expiration date  the company intends to seek a short term extension to allow for the completion of the term financing 
the company has no reason to believe that vfcc will not grant such an extension or that an agreement to refinance the bridge loan will not be reached prior to the then final maturity of the bridge facility 
if the facility were not extended  the remaining outstanding principal balance would be due at maturity 
working capital facility 
the company also maintains a million working capital line of credit with bank of america and first union national bank that is utilized for working capital and general corporate purposes 
this facility was increased to million in december borrowings under this facility bear interest at the company s option of i bank of america s prime lending rate  or ii a rate equal to above the libor rate for the applicable interest period 
in addition  the company is also required to pay period facility fees  as well as an annual agency fee

management considers its relationship with the lenders under this facility to be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not be renewed 
if the facility was not renewed however  or if material changes were made to its terms and conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
interest rate management 
the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short term basis while the secured term notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest 
the company s receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with the change in interest rates 
since a primary contributor to the company s profitability is its ability to manage its net interest spread  the company seeks to maximize the net interest spread while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
in connection with managing the net interest spread  the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps or caps to minimize the effects of market interest rate fluctuations on the net interest spread 
to the extent that the company has outstanding floating rate borrowings or has elected to convert a portion of its borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates  the company will be exposed to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
the company was previously a party to a swap agreement with bank of america pursuant to which the company s interest rate was fixed at on a notional amount of million 
the swap agreement expired on january  in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company entered into a swap agreement with bank of america pursuant to which the company pays a floating rate equal to the prevailing one month libor rate plus and receives a fixed rate of from the counterparty 
the initial notional amount of the swap was  which amortizes in accordance with the expected amortization of the notes 
final maturity of the swap is february  during the years ended april   and amounts paid pursuant to the company s interest rate management products were not material in relation to interest expense in the aggregate nor did they have a material impact on the company s weighted average costs of funds during such periods 
on october   in connection with the million acquisition facility  the company  through fifs acquisition  entered into a series of hedging instruments with first union national bank designed to hedge floating rate borrowings under the acquisition facility against changes in market rates 
accordingly  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  the first in the initial notional amount of million swap a pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at  and  the second in the initial notional amount of million swap b pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at 
the notional amount outstanding under each swap agreement amortizes based on an implied amortization of the hedged indebtedness 
swap a has a final maturity of december  while swap b matured on february  the company also purchased two interest rate caps which protect the company and the lender against any material increases in interest rates which may adversely affect any outstanding indebtedness which is not fully covered by the aggregate notional amount outstanding under the swaps 
the first cap agreement enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap a and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires december  and the cost of the cap is amortized in interest expense for the period 
the second cap agreement enables the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeds on a notional amount that increases initially and then amortizes based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under swap b and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expires february  and the cost of the cap is imbedded in the fixed rate applicable to swap b 
delinquency and credit loss experience the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by nonperforming receivables 
the company seeks to manage its risk of credit loss through i prudent credit evaluations  ii risk management activities  iii effective collection procedures  and iv by maximizing recoveries on defaulted loans 
an allowance for credit losses of  as of april  and  as of april  as a percentage of the receivables held for investment of  as of april  and  as of april  was 
at april  and april  with respect to receivables acquired for investment  the company has established a nonaccretable loss reserve to cover expected losses over the remaining life of the receivables 
as of april  and  the nonaccretable loss reserve as a percentage of receivables acquired for investment was and  respectively 
the nonaccretable portion represents the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over its expected cash flows 
the company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest 
accrual of interest is suspended when the payment from the borrower is over days past due 
generally  repossession procedures are initiated to days after the payment default 
under its financing programs  the company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables acquired 
historically  the company has purchased credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
until march  such insurance absorbed substantially all credit losses 
in april  the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter 
in addition  receivables financed under the fiarc and fiacc commercial paper facilities and receivables financed under the fiaic term notes do not carry default insurance 
provisions for credit losses of  and  have been recorded for the years ended april  and  respectively for losses on receivables which are either uninsured or which are reinsured by the company s captive insurance subsidiary 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of losses for receivables that have become impaired 
in making this estimate  management analyzes portfolio characteristics in the light of its underwriting criteria  delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and size  quality and concentration of the receivables  as well as external factors such as future economic outlooks 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
the following table summarizes the status and collection experience of all receivables acquired by the company dollars in thousands as of or for the years ended april  number number of loans amount of loans amount receivables held for investment delinquent amount outstanding days   days  days or more  total delinquencies   total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding during the period amounts of delinquent receivables outstanding and total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables are based on gross receivables balances  which include principal outstanding plus unearned interest income 
the total number of delinquent accounts days or more as a percentage of the number of outstanding receivables for the company s portfolio of receivables acquired for investment and managed receivables was and as of april  and  respectively 
market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix  developments in the financial markets  and further utilization by the company of risk mitigating strategies such as hedging 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates which are reset on a short term basis  whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
the company is therefore exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates on its credit facilities 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate increases on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company relies almost exclusively on revolving credit facilities to fund its origination of receivables 
periodically  the company will transfer receivables from a revolving to a term credit facility 
currently all of the company s credit facilities in combination with various swaps bear interest at floating rates tied to either a commercial paper index or libor 
as of april   the company had million of floating rate secured debt outstanding considering the effect of swap and cap agreements 
for every increase in commercial paper rates or libor  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates 
year issue the transition to the year date change was made without significant problems or interruption of business activity 
the company had implemented programs to assess the impact of the year date change on software and related technologies 
testing and modifications of the company s critical information systems were completed prior to december  the company did not incur any significant costs relating to year issues
