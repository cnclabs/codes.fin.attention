item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of the partnership 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
since the operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of the assets  revenues and earnings of the partnership  a separate discussion of the partnership s results of operations from other sources is not presented 
general the partnership s retail propane business consists primarily of transporting propane purchased on a year to year contract basis and in the spot market  mainly from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to storage tanks located on its customers premises 
in the partnership s wholesale operations  it sells propane to large industrial end users and other propane distributors 
product costs the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales prices and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many customers of the partnership rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather which can vary substantially from year to year 
risk management the partnership engages in hedging transactions to reduce the effect of price volatility on its product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
the partnership is currently a party to propane futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange and enters into forward and option agreements to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
these activities are monitored by management through enforcement of the partnership s commodity trading policy 
hedging does not always result in increased product margins and the partnership does not consider hedging activities to be material to operations or liquidity for the years ended september  and september  for additional information  see item a of this report 
selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and second quarter revenues and earnings are consistently greater than the comparable third and fourth quarter results 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the last two fiscal years 
fiscal unaudited in thousands  except per unit amounts first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal revenues      gain on sale of assets   income loss before interest expense and income taxes     net income loss      net income loss per unit

ebitda a      retail gallons sold      a ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is calculated as income loss before interest expense and income taxes plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not in accordance with or superior to generally accepted accounting principles  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and this measure may vary among companies  the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the partnership was party to propane forward and option contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
forward and future contracts provide that the partnership sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require its holder to buy or sell propane at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk the partnership is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures contracts traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
credit risk futures contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and as a result have minimal credit risk 
the partnership is subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
the partnership evaluates the financial condition of each counterparty with which it conducts business and establishes credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate the partnership s exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane related to its open inventory positions  the partnership developed a model which incorporated the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed price contract settlement amounts were utilized for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices were derived from the nymex for traded propane futures for each of the future periods as of september  c 
the market prices determined in b above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a above to project the additional loss in earnings which would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate potential losses in future earnings of million and million  as of september  and september   respectively 
the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   the partnership s open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
as of november   the posted price of propane at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon which is consistent with the posted price at september
