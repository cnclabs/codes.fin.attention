item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on june   unum corporation unum merged with and into provident companies  inc provident under the name unumprovident corporation 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the historical financial results discussed herein give effect to the merger as if it had been completed at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in item this discussion of consolidated operating results and operating results by segment excludes net realized investment gains and losses from revenue and income loss before taxes 
the company s investment focus has been on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains 
due to the nature of the company s business  a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
the realization of investment gains and losses will impact future earnings levels as the underlying business is long term in nature and requires that the company be able to sustain the assumed interest rates in its liabilities 
however  income excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income as a measure of the company s profitability 
management believes that the trends in new annualized sales in the employee benefits  individual  and voluntary benefits segments are important for investors to assess in their analysis of the company s results of operations 
the trends in new sales are indicators of the company s potential for growth in its respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new products 
the company has closely linked its various incentive compensation programs to the achievement of its goals for new sales and renewals of existing business 
the company s long term financial objectives  which balance growth and profitability  are to achieve sales growth of to percent per year  earnings per share growth of to percent per year  and a return on equity of to percent per year 
accounting policy changes  financial statement reclassifications  and merger expenses as a result of the merger  certain accounting policy changes and reclassification adjustments were made during the following summarizes these changes and reclassifications as well as the expenses related to the merger and the early retirement offer to employees 
the company values its available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of comprehensive income 
companies are required to also adjust deferred acquisition costs and or certain policyholder liabilities to reflect the changes that would have been necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the available for sale securities had been realized 
prior to the merger  unum adjusted policyholder liabilities and provident adjusted deferred policy acquisition costs dpac and value of business acquired voba for those products where these assets existed 
to present financial information in a common reporting format  management has determined that the combined entity will adjust policyholder liabilities rather than dpac and voba 
prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect this reclassification 
the reclassification did not change other comprehensive income  accumulated other comprehensive income  or fixed maturity and equity securities 
the reclassification reflected in the december   consolidated statement of financial condition resulted in an increase of million in dpac  million in voba  and million in reserves for future policy and contract benefits 
generally  because of the effort and time involved  reviews and updates of assumptions related to benefit liabilities are periodically undertaken over time and are reflected in the calculation of benefit liabilities as completed 
many factors influence assumptions underlying reserves  and considerable judgment is required to interpret current and historical experience underlying all of the assumptions and to assess the future factors that are likely to influence the ultimate cost of settling existing claims 
prior to the june  merger  unum s process and assumptions used to calculate the discount rate for claim reserves of certain disability businesses differed from that used by provident 
while unum s and provident s methods for calculating the discount rate for disability claim reserves were both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believed that the combined entity should have consistent discount rate accounting policies and methods for applying these policies for similar products 
the previous unum methodology used the same investment strategy for assets backing both liabilities and surplus 
provident s methodology  which allows for different investment strategies for assets backing surplus than those backing product liabilities  was determined by management to be the more appropriate approach for the combined entity 
accordingly  at june   the company adopted provident s method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves 
the impact on earnings related to the change in method of calculating the discount rate for claim reserves was million before tax and million after tax 
the charge was reflected in the employee benefits  individual  and other segments as an increase in benefits to policyholders of million  million  and million  respectively 
subsequent to the merger date  the company began to integrate the valuation procedures of the two organizations to provide for a more effective linking of pricing and reserving assumptions and to facilitate a more efficient process for adjusting liabilities to emerging trends 
included in this integration activity were a review and an update of assumptions that underlie policy and contract benefit liabilities 
the purpose of the study was to confirm or update the assumptions which were viewed as likely to affect the ultimate liability for contract benefits 
accordingly  as a result of the merger  the company accelerated the performance of its normal reviews of the assumptions underlying reserves to determine the assumptions that the newly merged company will use in the future for pricing  performance management  and reserving 
the review resulted in an increase in the benefits and reserves for future benefits for the company s domestic group long term disability unpaid claim liabilities 
as a result of the review  the company increased its policy and contract benefit liabilities million in the third quarter of  which reduced results million before tax and million after tax 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these charges and liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of capital and financing needs 
subsequent to the merger  the company also completed a review of the methodology and assumptions used for the capitalization and amortization of the costs of acquiring new business 
the result of the review was immaterial and was reflected in operating earnings  which were increased approximately million during to reflect the application of the revised estimate 
the change in estimate was applied to amounts capitalized in and will be applied to future years to reflect the combined entity s practices and pricing assumptions 
there was not a need to adjust amounts capitalized in years prior to  as those amounts are believed to be recoverable from the related policies 
a key element in the ability to recover amounts capitalized in prior periods is the persistency of the business 
the company monitors persistency and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current year s amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
actual persistency experienced during the fourth quarter of for group disability and group life compared unfavorably to the persistency expected  resulting in additional amortization of million during it is expected that persistency in will continue to be lower than historical levels for group disability as well as group life  which will unfavorably impact the level of amortization during during  the company recorded before tax expenses related to the merger of approximately million million after tax for severance and related costs  exit costs for duplicate facilities and asset abandonments  and investment banking  legal  and accounting fees 
the company also recorded in a before tax expense of approximately million million after tax related to the early retirement offer to the company s employees 
these expenses are reported in the corporate segment as other operating expenses and are further discussed in the section corporate segment operating results 
additionally  in the company expensed million million after tax of incremental costs associated with the merger 
these incremental costs consist primarily of compensation  training  integration  and licensing costs

in addition to the increases in benefit liabilities of million and the merger related and early retirement offer expenses of million discussed in the previous section  during the company recognized million of before tax charges related to its reinsurance operations 
these charges are as follows in millions north american reinsurance operations loss on sale of a h and ltc reinsurance management operations includes write off of million of goodwill loss on reinsurance of a h and ltc risk participations provision for losses on retained business international reinsurance operations provision for losses on lloyd s of london syndicate participations provision for losses on reinsurance pool participations other than lloyd s goodwill impairment excluding amount recognized on sale total before tax charge see other segment operating results and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s reinsurance operations 
a portion of the losses recognized in relating to the company s reinsurance operations does not receive a tax benefit  which unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate 
additionally  a portion of the expenses related to the merger was non deductible for federal income tax purposes  resulting in a tax rate that was less than the us federal statutory tax rate of percent 
in  the company recorded refunds from the internal revenue service relating to the final settlement of remaining issues for the through tax years 
the refund of taxes was million  and interest on the refunds was million 
overall  including interest and the tax provision thereon  results increased million due to settlements of prior year tax issues 
in the following discussion of operating results by segment  revenue includes premium income  net investment income  and other income 
income or loss excludes net realized investment gains and losses and federal income taxes 
employee benefits segment operating results year ended december change change in millions of dollars premium income group long term disability    group short term disability group life  accidental death dismemberment group long term care total premium income    net investment income other income total revenue    benefits and change in reserve    deferral of policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other operating expenses  total benefits and expenses    income before federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses 
nm the employee benefits segment includes group long term and short term disability insurance  group life insurance  accidental death and dismemberment coverages  group long term care  and the results of managed disability 
the increases in premium income result from strong sales trends over the past several quarters as well as an emphasis on renewal of existing business 
however  the rate of growth for group disability and group life sales decreased during several factors contributed to the decrease in sales  including rate increases  turnover in the field sales force  and merger related activities training  office relocation  and new processes and systems 
the company has a number of initiatives underway to help restore sales momentum  including targeted incentive plans  organizational changes to create a greater focus on the customer  and enhanced communication with producers 
the company expects that these actions will favorably impact future sales growth  but management intends to maintain pricing discipline to balance sales growth and profitability which will likely lead to lower long term sales growth than historically experienced by the company 
employee benefits new annualized sales decreased percent to million in from million new annualized sales were million in premium persistency for group long term and short term disability in the fourth quarter of was lower than historical levels due to several large case terminations  the aggressive renewal program  and the disruption in the field sales force 
for both products  the terminated block was less profitable than the total block 
it is expected that persistency in will continue to be lower than historical levels for group disability as well as group life 
revenue from the managed disability line of business  which includes genex services  inc and options and choices  inc  totaled million in compared to million in and million in both of these companies were acquired during group disability group disability revenue increased to  million in compared to  million in premium income growth was driven primarily by prior period sales 
as previously discussed  the rate of growth in new sales declined during new annualized sales for group long term disability were million in compared to million in new annualized sales for group short term disability were million in as compared to million in a critical part of the company s strategy for group disability during involves executing an aggressive renewal program and managing persistency  both of which management expects will have a positive impact on future premium growth and profitability 
however  the lower than historical premium persistency experienced during the fourth quarter of will have a negative impact on future premium income 
the company is implementing pricing changes in the group disability line 
prices will increase or decrease by market segment  as appropriate  to respond to current claim experience and various other factors and assumptions 
net investment income is expected to continue to increase due to the increase in the level of invested assets allocated to this line of business and also due to the portfolio restructuring  as discussed in investments 
group disability reported a loss of million for  as compared with million of income for the loss was the result of the million second quarter charge resulting from lowering the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions and the million third quarter charge resulting from the revision in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the ultimate cost of unpaid group long term disability claims  as discussed in the preceding accounting policy changes  financial statement reclassifications  and merger expenses 
excluding the effect of these two charges  this line reported an percent benefit ratio for the benefit ratio for was percent  excluding the effect of the fourth quarter of claims disruption charge discussed in the following paragraphs 
the incidence rates for new claims submitted for long term disability increased during over the level experienced in  but new claim incidence rates in the third and fourth quarters of improved relative to levels experienced in the first half of and the last half of small case business continues to perform well  and large case and mid size business showed improvement in the health services sector continues to experience higher incidence levels than average  but improved in the last half of incidence levels for the manufacturing sector also improved  declining to the levels experienced prior to the third quarter of the incidence rates for new claims submitted for short term disability improved during as compared to the level of claim incidence for long term and short term disability is being taken into account in the pricing of new business and the renewal of existing cases 
as explained in more detail below  the actual increase in claims durations during was greater than the increase assumed in the fourth quarter of claims disruption charge  resulting in a negative impact on the benefit ratio 
additionally  the benefit ratio was positively impacted by the updated factors used in calculating social security offset amounts 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher than expected level of terminations for long term and short term disability experienced during the fourth quarter of also included in is million of amortization related to the write off of the unamortized balance of deferred costs related to certain discontinued products in the foreign operations 
group disability revenue increased to  million in compared to  million in primarily due to the increase in premium income 
premium growth during for group long term disability was driven by favorable persistency  prior period sales  and strong new annualized sales  which were million in compared to million in new annualized sales for group short term disability increased percent to million in as compared to million in this growth reflected management s continuing efforts to cross sell group short term disability products with other employee benefits products  as well as increasing large case sales 
group disability reported income of million in as compared with million in long term disability was unfavorably affected by a higher benefit ratio in  largely the result of increased levels of claims incidence  an increase in the average size of claims  and a longer duration of claims as compared with positively impacting the benefit ratio in were updated factors used in calculating social security offset amounts 
short term disability also experienced increased claims incidence levels and larger size cases in as compared with in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for the group long term disability line of business in the employee benefits segment for the expected increase in claims durations due to management s expectation that productivity in the claims organization would be impacted as a result of planning  consolidation  and integration efforts related to the merger 
management expects the claims integration efforts to have some benefits  primarily related to claims incurred in future periods  as well as the potential for improved customer satisfaction and lower ultimate claim costs as best practices in return to work and claims management are implemented 
as benefits related to the integration become known  reserve assumptions will be revised  if appropriate 
insurance policies that are impacted by the temporary change in claim resolution rates will not perform as anticipated when priced 
however  since the cause of the additional claim cost is of a temporary nature  it is not anticipated to have an effect on future policy pricing 
the million reserve increase was not considered material from a capital adequacy position 
during  the claim operations integration activities progressed as assumed 
at december   management assumed the revised group disability claim resolution rates for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of to be    and percent of assumptions  respectively  before adjusting for the impact of the claim operations integration activities 
the actual experience was percent for the first quarter of  percent for the second quarter  percent for the third quarter  and percent for the fourth quarter 
if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at december   the loss for the group long term disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by million 
however  the shortfall of the actual experience below that assumed resulted in a negative effect on results of million 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  claim resolution assumptions underlying existing claim reserves were revised in the third quarter of  resulting in an increase in benefit liabilities of million 
in selecting the revised claim resolution assumptions  consideration was given to claims operations integration activities referenced here as well as other factors expected to impact the future effectiveness of the claims operations 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
as discussed under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements  certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in the company s business 
components of claims experience  including but not limited to  incidence levels and claims duration  may continue for some period of time at or above the higher levels experienced in and therefore  management continues to monitor claims experience in group disability and responds to changes by periodically adjusting prices  refining underwriting guidelines  changing product features  and strengthening risk management policies and procedures 
the company expects to price new business and re price existing business  at contract renewal dates  in an attempt to mitigate the effect of these and other factors  including interest rates  on new claim liabilities 
however  given the competitive market conditions for the company s disability products  it is uncertain whether pricing actions can mitigate the entire effect 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in the increase resulted from the growth in premium income  which was driven by strong prior period sales  and a lower operating expense ratio 
the results also benefited from higher net investment income and a higher volume of business 
there was a slight increase in the benefit ratio  from percent in to percent in  primarily due to an increase in the average claim size in the group life line of business 
new annualized sales increased to million in compared to million in premium persistency for group life in the latter part of was lower than historical levels  and it is expected that persistency in will continue to be lower than historical levels 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for includes million of additional amortization due to the higher than expected level of terminations 
group life  accidental death and dismemberment  and long term care reported income of million in compared to million in the increase in income resulted from the growth in premium income  which was driven by strong sales  and a favorable benefit ratio in the group life and accidental death and dismemberment lines

the individual segment includes results from the individual disability  individual life  and individual long term care lines of business 
individual disability new annualized sales in the individual disability income line of business were million in and million in as discussed in the employee benefits segment operating results  several factors contributed to the decrease in sales  including rate increases  turnover in the sales force  and merger related activities 
however  the persistency of existing individual disability income business continued to be favorable during management expects that premium income in the individual disability income line will grow on a year over year basis as the product transition produces increasing levels of new sales of individual disability products and as a result of the sales initiatives discussed under employee benefits segment operating results 
income in the individual disability income line of business increased to million in from million in as discussed in the preceding accounting policy changes  financial statement reclassifications  and merger expenses  in the second quarter of the company lowered the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions  which decreased individual disability income by million in this line reported an increase in the benefit ratio in compared to the claim resolution rate compares unfavorably with  but has shown improvement throughout new claims for were fairly level with this line benefited from higher net investment income and a favorable operating expense ratio for as compared to revenue for individual disability was  million in and  million in the growth in revenue in was driven primarily by the growth in premium income as well as net investment income 
new annualized sales in the individual disability line of business were up percent in  rising to million from million in income in the individual disability line of business decreased to million in from million in as noted in the employee benefits segment operating results  claim resolution rates were revised downward in the fourth quarter of for claim operations integration activities related to the merger 
the company recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of in the individual segment related to the revised claim resolution rates for individual disability 
at december   management assumed the revised individual disability claim resolution rates for the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of to be    and percent of assumptions  before adjusting for the impact of the claim operations integration activities 
the actual experience for the company was percent in the first quarter  percent in the second quarter  percent in the third quarter  and percent in the fourth quarter of if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim durations had not been anticipated at december   income for the individual disability line of business would have been negatively impacted by million in in addition  the excess of the actual experience over that assumed resulted in a positive effect on income of million 
the million reserve increase in the individual segment was not considered material from a capital adequacy position 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
individual life and long term care the individual long term care line of business reported increased premium income for both and as compared to the previous year  primarily due to new sales growth 
new annualized sales were million for  an increase of percent over the million reported in new annualized sales were million in the company expects the strong sales momentum in individual long term care to continue 
income in the individual life and long term care lines of business increased slightly to million in from million in the benefit ratio and operating expense ratio for individual life improved in as compared to the operating expense ratio for long term care also compares favorably with income in the individual life and long term care lines of business was million in the increase in premium income for was offset by a less favorable benefit ratio 
voluntary benefits segment operating results year ended december change change in millions of dollars premium income net investment income other income total revenue benefits and change in reserve deferral of policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other operating expenses total benefits and expenses income before federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses the voluntary benefits segment includes the results of products sold to employees through payroll deduction at the work site 
these products include life insurance and health products  primarily disability  accident and sickness  and cancer 
revenue in the voluntary benefits segment increased to million in from million sales growth and favorable persistency were the primary factors contributing to the increase in premium income 
new annualized sales in this segment were million in  million in  and million in management continues its efforts to increase sales through the realignment of the sales organization and the enhancement of collaborative sales 
however  these sales are not necessarily indicative of the levels that may be attained in the future 
income in the voluntary benefits segment in was million versus million in the increase in income for was primarily due to the increase in premium income in all of the product lines and an increase in investment income  partially offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the life and the accident  sickness  and disability product lines 
income for this segment increased for as compared with  primarily due to additional investment income and a reduced benefit ratio in the accident  sickness  and disability product line  partially offset by an increase in interest credited and a higher benefit ratio in the cancer product line 
the increase in investment income and interest credited is largely due to the assumption of work site marketed universal life insurance under reinsurance agreements entered into during and during  management continued to implement organizational changes to focus on specific distribution channels to market voluntary benefits products 
other segment operating results year ended december change change in millions of dollars premium income net investment income other income total revenue    benefits and expenses   income loss before federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses losses the other operating segment includes results from reinsurance pools and management and other products no longer actively marketed  including corporate owned life insurance  group pension products  and individual annuities 
it is expected that revenue and income in this segment will decline over time as these business lines wind down 
management expects to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of the employee benefits  individual  and voluntary benefits segments 
the closed blocks of business have been segregated for reporting and monitoring purposes 
during  the company recognized a charge of million in the other segment related to its decision to exit the reinsurance operations 
reinsurance pools and management premium income increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to increased participation in the lloyd s of london syndicates 
the reinsurance pools and management reported a loss of million in compared to income of million in income in the reinsurance pools and management line decreased million in due to the charges discussed below 
during the first quarter of  the company began a comprehensive strategic review of its reinsurance operations to determine the appropriateness of their fit within the context of the merged entity 
these operations include the reinsurance management operations of duncanson holt  inc d h and the risk assumption  which includes reinsurance pool participation  direct reinsurance which includes accident and health a h  long term care ltc  and long term disability coverages  and lloyd s of london lloyd s syndicate participations 
in april  the strategic review was completed  and the company concluded that these operations were not solidly aligned with the company s strength in the disability insurance market 
the company decided to exit these operations through a combination of a sale  reinsurance  and or placing certain components in run off and recorded a first quarter charge of million in the other segment 
during the first and second quarters of  the company recorded million and million  respectively  in the corporate segment related to the write off of goodwill 
during the third quarter of  the company continued its efforts to sell its reinsurance management operations 
no potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring the entire domestic and international reinsurance management operations 
however  in october  the company entered into an agreement to sell the reinsurance management operations of its a h and ltc reinsurance facilities and to reinsure the company s risk participation in these facilities 
because of the limited interest expressed by potential buyers in the reinsurance management operations  the company reevaluated its strategy to exit the reinsurance operations 
the company decided to continue to operate its north america long term disability reinsurance operation and to refocus it with the objective of improving profitability 
with respect to lloyd s  the company decided to implement a strategy which limits participation in year underwriting risks  ceases participation in lloyd s underwriting risks after year  and manages the run off of its risk participation in open years of account of lloyd s reinsurance syndicates 
the company also decided to discontinue its accident reinsurance business in london beginning in year during the third quarter of  the company recognized a charge of million in the other segment and million in the corporate segment related to the write off of goodwill

as discussed in the preceding accounting policy changes  financial statement reclassifications  and merger expenses  the company lowered the discount rate used to calculate certain of unum s disability claim reserves to conform with provident s process and assumptions  which decreased group long term disability reinsurance income by million in in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge related to the revised claim resolution rates for group long term disability reinsurance 
if the impact of merger related claim operations integration activities on claim duration had not been anticipated at december   income for the reinsurance pools and management line of business would have been negatively impacted by million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
during the fourth quarter of  certain reinsurance pools managed by the company s reinsurance management operations received new claim information from ceding insurance enterprises about certain older pool years and completed an analysis of recent claims experience deterioration 
as a result of these factors  certain pools strengthened claim reserves 
the impact to the company from these pool claim reserve increases was an million reduction in other income and a million increase in benefits to policyholders  reducing before tax income by million 
the million reduction in other income reflected lower profit commission levels in certain older pool years after the pool claim reserve strengthening 
the million increase in benefits to policyholders represented the amount of additional claim reserves the company recognized as a result of its participation in the pools that strengthened claim reserves 
corporate owned life income from this line of business was million in  million in  and million in the results reflect slightly higher premium income and wider spreads between interest earned and credited rates

these expenses consist primarily of compensation  training  integration  and licensing costs 
the financial statements do not reflect any benefit expected from revenue enhancements or derived from potential cost savings related to the merger 
although management anticipates revenue enhancements and costs savings will result from the merger  there can be no assurance that these items will be achieved 
economies of scale  the elimination of duplicative expenditures  and the consistent use of the best practices of provident and unum are expected to enable the company to achieve annual cost savings of approximately million in during  the company realized approximately million of cost savings 
investments investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios  which support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset durations with related expected liability durations and to maximize investment returns  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations

the company uses models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the company has not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid

interest lost on restructured loans was immaterial for the years ended december    and real estate was million and million at december  and  respectively 
investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets the company s investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets the company s investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
allowances for probable losses on mortgage loans and real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets as well as on an overall portfolio basis  considering the value of the underlying assets and collateral 
if a decline in value is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recorded as a realized investment loss

all transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
almost all transactions are associated with the individual and group disability product portfolios

failure to have adequately addressed and substantially resolved year issues could have had  and as to mission critical systems in certain circumstances would have had  a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
while there can be no assurance as to its long term success  the company completed a project which was intended and designed to avoid and or mitigate any such material adverse effect from year issues 
the company s program for the year was organized into a number of phases for rectifying its internal computer systems  including assessment  code remediation  testing  and deployment 
the program continues to monitor systems for year issues  including the ability to properly handle the dates of february  march  june  october  and december  and february and december  to date  no material issues have been identified 
there are numerous instances in which third parties having a relationship with the company had and may continue to have year issues to address and resolve 
these include  among others  vendors of hardware and software  holders of group insurance policies  issuers of investment securities  financial institutions  governmental agencies  and suppliers 
an aspect of the company s year program was to assess its critical external dependencies and  as part of its due diligence efforts  to contact certain third parties seeking written assurance as to their expectancy to be year compliant 
the nature of the company s follow up to its written requests to third parties depended upon its assessment of the response and of the materiality of the effect of non compliance by the third party on the company 
in some instances the company performed site visits to certain third party businesses and tested their systems for compliance 
in addition  the company tested external electronic interfaces with certain critical business partners 
the company implemented contingency plans to alleviate the potential business impact of third parties not being year compliant 
to date  no significant issues from critical external dependencies have been identified  however  there can be no guarantee that the computer systems of these third parties will continue to be year trouble free 
as a result  the company will continue to monitor these dependencies for year problems 
the effort of internal business and systems personnel devoted to the project has been considerable 
temporary personnel and subject matter consultants were utilized  when appropriate  to assist full time personnel in some phases or aspects of the project 
the company utilized compensation programs to retain project personnel in order to keep the project on schedule 
while the project required systems management to more closely scrutinize the prioritization of information technology projects  it is not believed that any deferral of information technology projects has had a material impact on the company 
the company also had occasional contact with certain peer companies comparing approaches to year issues 
monitoring for and responding to year issues is now an integral part of the regular assignments of systems personnel 
although there was a broad range of possibilities that could have occurred in connection with non compliance with year that might have affected the company  particularly as a consequence of third parties  the company experienced no material problems before  on  or after january  consequently  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its business  results of operations  or financial condition from year issues 
with regard to any subsequent non compliance resulting from the company s systems  which the company believes to be less likely than that resulting from third parties  the company will provide adequate financial and personnel resources to remediate the problem as soon as possible 
with regard to non compliance resulting from third party failure  the company has appropriate contingency arrangements that will minimize such impact  however  given the range of possibilities  no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
in addition  the company developed detailed plans for activities for managing the year end rollover period 
this included plans for appropriate backup of data  year end processing schedules  limiting installations of new code  and the availability of special response teams tasked with identifying and resolving any issues which might occur during the rollover period 
these teams included both information technology and business professionals 
the rollover was conducted with no material issues arising 
the foregoing discussion of the year issue contains forward looking statements relating to such matters as financial performance and the business of the company 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order for the company to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience relating to compliance with year to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements concerning year issues  which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
these factors include i the unanticipated material impact of a system fault of the company relating to year  ii the failure to successfully remediate  in spite of testing  material systems of the company  iii the time it may take to successfully remediate a failure once it occurs  as well as the resulting costs and loss of revenues  and iv the failure of third parties to properly remediate material year problems 
since inception of the project  the company has expensed approximately million through december   in connection with incremental cost of the year project and estimates an additional million of expense during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair values of those assets currently reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost or at the unpaid balance  namely mortgage loans  held to maturity securities  and policy loans  would decrease by approximately million  million  and million  respectively  at december  and by approximately million  million  and million  respectively  at december  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities would increase approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and approximately million and million  respectively  at december  the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a matrix pricing system whereby all securities are priced with the resulting market rates and spreads assuming a change of basis points 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities dominated in those local currencies 
foreign operations represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue for and  respectively 
assuming foreign exchange rates decreased percent from the december  level  year end stockholders equity would not be materially affected
