our products and services are provided from our three operating facilities located in fort lauderdale  florida  santa ana  california  and new albany  indiana 
in may  we announced and commenced the development of proxymed 
com  a healthcare portal website aimed at increasing the use of our services through the internet 
in november  the first version of the website was introduced 
in march  version of the portal was introduced with our first two transaction services eligibility verification and laboratory test results reporting 
when fully developed  proxymed 
com will offer a secure  single access point through the web for all connectivity needs of physicians and other healthcare providers to facilitate healthcare ecommerce services 
business combinations were consummated during the periods presented and are included in the consolidated financial statements after their respective dates of acquisition

these two segments are shown as discontinued operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been reclassified to segregate the net assets and operating results of these segments 
sales of both of these segments are expected to be completed by the end of results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
consolidated net revenues for increased by  or  to  from consolidated net revenues of  for this increase is primarily due to the net effect of i our acquisitions of key communications  specialized medical management and integrated medical systems  which were all consummated during or subsequent to the period  partially offset by ii decreases from the sales of non exclusive source code licenses for our prescription and laboratory software products  which were sold in the period  for which there were no comparable transactions in cost of sales and gross profit margin 
cost of services and license fees includes third party electronic transaction processing costs  certain telecommunication costs  third party databases  and certain labor and travel costs 
cost of sales for communication devices  computer systems  and other tangible goods includes hardware  third party software  direct labor and consumable materials

as a result of these factors  consolidated sg a expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased to in from in depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  to  for from  for this increase was primarily due to amortization charges for goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of specialized medical management in and integrated medical systems in loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the foregoing  the loss from continuing operations was  in compared to a loss from continuing operations of  in discontinued operations 
the loss from the discontinued operations of our network integration and prescription drug dispensing segments increased by  to a loss of  in from a loss of  in additionally  we have estimated a loss on the disposal of the prescription drug dispensing segment of  including estimated operating losses through the disposal date and other exit costs

accordingly  the contingent payment made to the former owner of hayes computer systems was recorded as goodwill  and is being amortized through april  amortization expense included in was  compared to no amortization expense in additionally  as a result of the contingent payment  we recorded a charge of  in related to the expensing of in process research and development technology

consolidated sg a expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales decreased to in  from in  as we established a higher revenue base through our acquisitions 
in addition  the rate of increase in sales in exceeded the rate of increase in sg a expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was due to the following i amortization charges for goodwill associated with our acquisitions completed in and which are being amortized over three years  ii amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software costs  iii depreciation charges associated with our internal systems and related equipment  iv amounts payable to walgreens associated with the acquisition of prescribe  and v amortization charges for other intangibles associated with our acquisitions 
goodwill previously recorded from the acquisitions of us healthdata interchange and clinical microsystems is being amortized on the straight line method over three years beginning april  goodwill from these acquisitions was previously being amortized on the straight line method over years 
this change in estimate results in an additional amortization expense of approximately  per year 
the decision to change the goodwill amortization periods in fiscal resulted from changes in the business strategies for clinical microsystems and us healthdata interchange 
clinical microsystems primary product  clinscan  is still being sold and supported  but is being de emphasized in favor of an electronic transaction processing model for the transmission of lab order and results 
for us healthdata interchange  our subsequent acquisition of integrated medical systems resulted in the substitution of integrated medical systems technology platform and transaction processing systems from those of us healthdata interchange 
in both cases  due to these subsequent actions  we reconsidered the original year life for goodwill and deemed it appropriate to change it to a shorter three year life in recognition of these reasons and the frequently changing nature of the technology environment in which we operate 
in process research and development technology 
as a result of a contingent payment made to the former owner of hayes computer systems in  we recorded a charge of  in related to the expensing of in process research and development technology included in discontinued operations 
in  we recorded a charge of  for in process research and development technology 
a full description of these charges is contained in the following paragraphs 
portions of the initial purchase prices for the hayes computer systems and clinical microsystems acquisitions were allocated to in process research and development technology  resulting in charges to our operations of  for the hayes computer systems acquisition included in discontinued operations and  for the clinical microsystems acquisition 
the following products are includable as in process research and development technology 
a kims the in process research and development acquired from hayes computer systems consisted of the krypton internet messaging server kims  a server to server intranet email system designed to provide more security  higher performance and a lower price than comparable unix based email systems 
at the time of the acquisition  this product was in the alpha phase of programming and had the capability of processing only simple email communications 
proxymed intended to complete the development of a testing lab  the development of the kims product  and the development of the electronic transaction processing version of the product at an estimated cost of approximately  and include it in its electronic transaction processing product offering to physicians and other healthcare providers using the proxynet network by the end of calendar material risks affecting the timely completion and commercialization of the kims product included new technologies that make the kims technology obsolete or unusable  the availability of programming and design resources to complete the product  the availability of funding necessary to complete the product  the nature of technical issues that are discovered during the development and testing stages  and product acceptance by physicians and other healthcare providers as compared to other products available in the marketplace 
shortly after the acquisition  microsoft corporation released its improved email product 
therefore  the decision to complete the kims product was temporarily suspended until an assessment of the microsoft product could be completed 
at first  after analyzing the kims product and discussing the opportunities for it  we decided to complete the kims product and expected to have it completed in and include it in our future web based product line  however  in  in connection with our new initiative to develop proxymed 
com  our healthcare portal website  we decided to adopt microsoft s technology for email  and abandon the kims in process research and development technology 
b clinscan intranet the in process research and development acquired from clinical microsystems consisted of the clinscan intranet  a system designed to provide hospitals with the capability to connect hospital based and office based physicians together  in a private wide area network  or intranet 
the hospitals and physicians would have the ability to electronically exchange messages  images  files and other valuable clinical information  including the exchange of clinical orders and results using proven interface technology 
by incorporating the clinscan workstation at physician sites  this software application would provide access to all of the hospital based legacy systems invisibly 
by adding high speed communications access  hospitals and physicians would be able to access the internet 
at the time of the acquisition  completion of the communication protocols for incoming and outgoing messaging and an interface for communications to the legacy systems had been developed 
proxymed intended to complete the global patient data repository  routing functionality  cross relation master indexes  and master catalogue of clinical functionality of the product at an estimated cost of approximately  and include it as a clinical electronic transaction processing product offering to physicians  laboratories and other healthcare providers by the start of the technology supported by the research performed on the clinscan intranet was used by proxymed to develop its lab network intranet server  the central information processor for its latest clinscan software product 
revenues from the sales of the clinscan involving its lab network internet server commenced in to determine the fair value of the acquired in process research and development  proxymed used independent appraisals which utilized standard appraisal methodologies 
each appraisal procedure performed involved projected cash flows for kims and clinscan intranet over their estimated useful lives  net of ongoing operating investment needs including working capital  fixed assets and other assets that support the products 
an effective income tax rate of was applied to each of the cash flows representing the expected marginal combined federal and state tax rate to apply over the cash flow periods 
these cash flows were discounted to their present value using a discount rate of  which is reflective of a start up company for which the kims and clinscan intranet products are similar in risk 
the kims product was valued at  and the clinscan intranet product was valued at  using these model assumptions 
the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility to permit capitalization  and the technology had no alternative future use 
income tax benefits resulted from these charges of approximately  and  for the hayes computer systems and clinical microsystems acquisitions  respectively  however  based on the weight of available evidence  valuation allowances for the full amounts have been recorded 
interest  net 
we incurred net interest expense for of  whereas we earned net interest income for of  the amount reflects interest expense incurred on the debt of key communications  and interest expense on the debt issued for the acquisition of clinical microsystems  offset by interest earned on invested funds 
in connection with the merger with key communications  the debt guaranteed by key communications was retired 
loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the foregoing  the loss from continuing operations was  in compared to a loss from continuing operations of  in discontinued operations 
the loss from the discontinued operations of our network integration and prescription drug dispensing segments decreased by  to a loss of  in  compared to a loss of  in revenues from the network integration segment were  in compared to  in the net loss for this segment was  in compared to  in the losses include charges for in process research development of  in and  in revenues from the prescription drug dispensing segment were  in compared to  in the net loss for this segment was  in compared to net income of  in net loss applicable to common shareholders 
as a result of the foregoing  we recorded a net loss applicable to common shareholders of  in  as compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources in  cash used in operating activities totaled  this was primarily due to our net loss partially offset by depreciation and amortization charges 
in january  we purchased the healthcare electronic transaction processing assets of specialized medical management for  in cash 
additionally  we spent approximately  for fixed assets and capitalized software development costs   for acquisition related costs  paid  in cash and issued  shares of common stock in final payment for the hayes computer systems acquisition  paid  in cash and issued  shares of common stock for our debt obligation to the former owner of clinical microsystems  inc  and paid  to walgreens under our contract for the purchase of prescribe 
these activities were financed through available cash resources  a private placement sale of  shares of convertible preferred stock resulting in net proceeds of  a private placement sale of  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of  net draws of  on our revolving line of credit  and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
as a result of these activities  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as of december in february   we adopted a plan to sell our non core network integration and prescription drug dispensing segments 
the sale of these entities by the end of will provide additional cash to further support our core businesses 
our available funds continue to be used for operations  the further development and marketing of our products and services including proxymed 
com  our healthcare portal website  equipment and other general corporate purposes 
as a result of acquisitions made in and  we are obligated to pay  in april to the former owner of clinical microsystems  and  in june to the former owner of prescribe 
the clinical microsystems payment may be made at least in cash and the balance  if any  in common stock 
in addition  we are continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities and other strategic alternatives that add synergies to our product offerings and business strategy 
in general  we believe that the long term effects of our various acquisitions have been accretive to our liquidity 
while no assurances can be given that revenue synergies will occur  we expect that there will be opportunities to increase revenues by cross selling products and services to the customers of the acquired entities  as well as revenue opportunities from our product development efforts  including proxymed 
com 
in addition  we expect to continue to experience cost reduction synergies from operations that have been or are planned to be combined 
for example  we believe cost reductions have been achieved  or will be achieved  from the following measures the electronic transaction processing operations relating to the acquisitions of integrated medical systems  us healthdata interchange and specialized medical management have been merged into one location  the lab operations relating to the clinical microsystems products and the key communications operations have been merged together  and the prescribe technology has been merged with our pre existing prescription electronic transaction processing products 
however  on a short term basis  we generally incur additional expenses resulting from our acquisitions due to stay pay incentives during the transition period  moving costs for employees that are retained  and the merging of different transaction networks 
we do not expect our interest costs to increase as a result of our acquisitions  as most of the financing for the acquisitions resulted from issuances of our equity securities  and debt carried by the acquired entities was paid off 
while amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions will not affect our future cash outflows  we expect that such acquisition related charges will approximate  per quarter through the first quarter of and then decrease to  per quarter by the end of in july  we signed an accounts receivable based revolving line of credit agreement of up to  borrowings are based on of eligible accounts receivable  repayable on july   collateralized by a lien on all of our assets  and bear interest at the prime rate plus payable monthly which has ranged from to 
as of december   we had  outstanding and approximately  available for borrowing under this credit facility 
at the current time  we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
however  our capital spending will increase over the next several quarters as the continued development and infrastructure for proxymed 
com and the related personnel staffing is completed 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was times at december  and times at december  this increase is primarily due to the remaining proceeds from the private placement of convertible preferred stock in december for the periods ended december  and  accounts receivable turnover for us was times in the period and is comparable to times in the period 
our inventory turnover was times in the period compared to times in the period 
this increase is attributable to improved efficiency in operations at key communications 
we expect to continue to incur negative net cash flow from operations until we begin receiving higher levels of revenues  primarily driven by proxymed 
com  our healthcare web portal 
management is committed to the strategy of investing funds in further marketing and development of our products and services  specifically for proxymed 
com  which will integrate our existing desktop products into a single internet based solution 
we may also pursue additional acquisitions which are deemed to be in accordance with our business strategy 
all of these plans may require additional equity or debt financing 
we believe that we have access to sources of cash to continue to fund our operating needs  our research and development activities  our acquisition obligations and our strategic needs 
in the recent past  we have raised cash to fund our operations and pay for acquisitions from the private placement sales of our common stock 
we believe that we can continue to finance our short term cash needs in this manner as well as utilize our asset based debt financing 
we are currently evaluating the long term cash needs of proxymed 
com  and we may seek cash through the public equity markets  however  there can be no assurances that any such financing will be available under terms and conditions acceptable to us 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing to fund the increased research and development expenditures and increased marketing expenditures either through equity raises  debt issuance or the sale of non core assets  such increased expenditures could be reduced to historical levels  and we could operate at near cash flow break even until such additional financing is available 
future outlook we continue to grow through concentration of our efforts on our core ehealth business including proxymed 
com  our business relationships  our strategic acquisitions and other plans to increase the usage of our healthcare information technology products and services to achieve requisite economies of scale 
prior to the second quarter of  we had successfully reduced our operating losses before non cash charges 
such non cash charges are significant and result primarily from amortization expenses related to our acquisitions 
however  with the development  marketing and implementation of proxymed 
com  we anticipate that our operating losses may grow until we generate sufficient recurring revenues from our products and services to cover the total of our cash and non cash expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will realize an adequate level of recurring revenues from the sale of our products and services  or that revenues from our operations  the business plan for proxymed 
com  or those of our recently acquired businesses and any future acquisitions will ultimately result in achievement of profitability 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe that the impact of adopting sab will not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
year compliance general 
many installed computer systems and software products were coded to accept only two digit dates 
such systems would not be able to distinguish th century dates from st century dates 
to address these and any other year operational issues which could affect us  in september we appointed a year committee and hired a year project manager to review our internal computer systems and our products and services as well as review the progress of our principal customers  vendors and resellers 
the committee developed a priority order list of our products and services and commenced the year project plan in accordance with this list 
our year project plan consisted of four phases assessment  remediation  validation and distribution 
the primary purpose of the assessment phase was to list and analyze the inventory of our products sold and supported 
the major issues encountered during this phase were the identification of language the software is written in  the source code and any third party libraries in a product 
the remediation phase was where changes to the programs and codes were actually made 
the validation phase was where the remediated products were tested and then submitted for independent verification and validation 
the distribution phase  specifically for proprietary products  was where the remediated products were provided to our customers 
as of the end of  we had completed all phases of our year project plan 
we did not experience any material adverse impact on our operations during the beginning of as a result of year issues of our customers  internal systems  suppliers and vendors 
products and services 
with respect to our products and services  we met our expected completion date of september for distribution of remediated proprietary laboratory  financial  and prescription software applications 
by the end of  remediation of our financial and clinical networks was completed 
all new software application releases have been prepared in accordance with our year readiness standards 
additionally  we had contacted all third party vendors whose proprietary tools and library products are incorporated into our products in order to determine their respective year readiness status 
certain of those third parties had required actions to be taken by us 
such actions have been performed in accordance with instructions provided by the vendor 
finally  we had contacted our customers to inform them of our year readiness status 
updates to that information will continue to be posted on our website 
acquisitions 
the committee was also responsible for identifying year issues that may be present in acquisition candidates  as year compliance was a factor in determining the suitability of an acquisition 
recent acquisitions had included representations from the sellers regarding year compliance so that we would have recourse in the event that unforeseen year issues arose 
based on representations made at time of our merger with key communications  we believed that key communications products and services would operate satisfactorily in a year environment 
by the end of  we completed the assessment  remediation and validation phases of their products and services to verify those representations  and based on procedures performed  we have not had to take any additional actions 
concerning our acquisition of specialized medical management  we had identified three potential year issues  all of which were resolved by the end of first  all of specialized medical management s customers required a software upgrade and we replaced their software with our year ready products 
second  specialized medical management s financial transactions network was combined with our existing financial transactions network  which is year compliant 
third  certain financial transaction services provided to a certain payer were remediated 
internal systems  vendors and suppliers 
we completed the assessment and remediation phases with respect to our internal administrative systems 
risk assessment was evaluated on all documentation received from our vendors  suppliers  and clinical and financial transaction processing partners 
final attempts to contact unresponsive requests were completed by the end of october costs 
since the formation of the year committee in september  we spent approximately  through february   primarily for personnel and hardware costs 
the total estimated budget for expenditures directly related to our year effort was approximately  the budget included staffing costs for employees hired specifically to address year issues  however  it did not include internal staff costs  as these costs were considered part of the normal release structure of our products 
the estimated budget also included hardware upgrade costs  much of which would have been incurred in our normal equipment replacement plans 
as we did not  or expect to  experience significant systems or other year problems at or after the turn of the millennium  we do not expect to incur any significant additional costs related to our year efforts 
contingency plan 
while some worst case scenarios were associated with risks outside our control including power and communications  we attempted to assess those scenarios within our control 
the year committee identified the major areas of concern to be the handling of data formatting and transmitting compliant data  and our customers usage of our software products 
to deal with some of these concerns  we had informed our financial network users of the availability of an algorithm to allow those with non compliant formats to continue transmitting to payers in a year compatible format 
our customer support departments had developed policies and procedures and mock testing scenarios to assist our hardware and software customers with year related issues 
a permanent year business continuity and contingency plan for potential disruption and data corruption issues brought about by the year was completed in september while unforeseen year failures may dictate changes to previously established procedures  we will continually and immediately attempt to diagnose and fix problems  if they arise 
each particular problem dictates an alternate method of processing to maintain business continuity 
in the event that a year problem occurs at an external entity  that entity will be informed of the problem and we will continue to review and repair the dates until the problem is fixed 
however  as not all year issues will necessarily surface during the beginning of  no assurance can be given that one or more of our major customers or suppliers will not encounter future year problems which could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
the extent of our future year exposure is based on our management s knowledge to date  and although we do not expect any year issues to surface in the future  there is no guarantee that this will be achieved 
specific factors that give rise to this uncertainty include  but are not limited to  availability and cost of personnel  failure to identify and correct all year susceptible systems and applications  future year problems encountered by customers  suppliers and other third parties whose systems and operations impact us  and other similar uncertainties 
cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this document contains forward looking statements that reflect our current expectations regarding future events 
while these statements reflect our best current judgment  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from projected results due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to assumptions  beliefs and opinions relating to our growth strategy based upon our interpretation and analysis of healthcare industry trends and management s ability to successfully develop  market  sell and implement its ecommerce solutions  clinical and financial etransaction services and software applications to physicians  pharmacies  laboratories and payers 
these factors and other risk factors are more fully discussed in the our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we expressly disclaim any intent or obligation to update any forward looking statements
