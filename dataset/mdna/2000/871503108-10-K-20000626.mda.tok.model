we are amortizing the value of both the goodwill and customer base over years 
we did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal recent divestitures on december   we divested our act and visual cafe product lines 
because the divestitures of the act and visual cafe product lines were effective at the close of business on december   these product lines are included in the results of operations through december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each item for the periods indicated 
period to period percentage increase decrease year ended march  compared compared to to net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill amortization of intangibles from acquisitions acquired in process research and development restructuring and other expenses litigation judgment total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income percentage change is not meaningful net revenues net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal were largely due to increased sales to our corporate customers  introductions of new products and increased sales outside of north america 
consumer and small business our consumer and small business segment represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
although net revenues for this segment decreased as a percentage of net revenues  net revenues in absolute dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to outbreaks of significant viruses  new releases of both new and existing products and our customers preparing for the year rollover 
these factors contributed to growth in sales of norton antivirus  norton systemworks and norton we have discontinued norton and we no longer expect any future sales from this product 
net revenues in absolute dollars decreased in the consumer and small business segment in fiscal over fiscal  due to price competition for some of our products 
however  we did experience increased revenue from sales of norton antivirus and our successful introduction of suite products 
these increases were offset by reductions in net revenues for norton utilities 
during fiscal  and  the financial impact of product price reductions for certain of our principal products was offset by the increase in the volume of products sold 
enterprise solutions and e support our enterprise solutions and e support segments represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to strong demand for our e support products norton ghost and pcanywhere and increases due to virus outbreaks and year preparation by enterprises 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales of pcanywhere and the new release of norton ghost 
international net revenues outside of north america represented  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
international net revenues increased by million in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal this increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in europe and japan 
net revenues from sales outside of north america were million and million and represented and of net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was also largely due to stronger sales to europe and japan 
weaknesses in currencies fixed to the euro during fiscal  slightly offset by strengths in other currencies  negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately million 
the impact in fiscal was less than million 
pro forma revenue giving effect to divestitures for comparative purposes  the following table displays  on a pro forma basis  our net revenues excluding the act and visual cafe product lines year ended march  in thousands pro forma net revenues    product returns we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns 
product returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products  which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the products 
the mix of products returned from the distributors resellers as compared to products sold to the distributors resellers does not impact the gross margins  as our gross margins are consistent across our various product families 
changes in the level of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by a change in the level of gross revenue 
as a result  the product returns provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write off of capitalized software 
gross margin was of net revenues in fiscal  and capitalized software as indicated in the overview  during fiscal we acquired urlabs  l network security s operations and software 
as a result  we recorded acquired capitalized software  or acquired product rights  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal we acquired binary s operations  intel s anti virus business and quarterdeck 
after adjusting for the final purchase price allocations  we recorded acquired product rights of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
amortization of acquired product rights  which are included in cost of revenues  totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to a full year of amortization on our fiscal acquisitions and the acquisition of urlabs in fiscal as the l network security and software acquisitions were not complete until late march  there was no significant amortization in fiscal related to these acquisitions 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to additional amortization related to acquired product rights associated with our acquisition of intel s anti virus business and the acquisitions of binary s operations and quarterdeck 
the amortization of our fiscal and acquisitions will occur over the next to years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
research and development expenses we charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses were for fiscal and remained flat at for fiscal and fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal from fiscal largely resulted from overall growth in our net revenues 
although research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues  absolute dollars increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of increases in software development costs paid to additional contractors  employee related expenses and additional costs for settlements related to disputes over technology rights in fiscal  offset by a reduction of research and development expenses resulting from our divestitures of the visual cafe and act product lines 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of increased spending on new product development 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were  and  of net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the sales and marketing expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to increased headcount and related salaries  commissions and other performance based compensation 
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing dollars for fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to increased headcount  as well as increased spending in advertising and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were of net revenues in fiscal and and of net revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  legal fees and write offs of certain uncollectible receivables  offset by reductions in certain consulting expenses incurred in fiscal general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to reductions in our information system costs 
amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to the acquisitions in fiscal and amortization of goodwill in fiscal is primarily related to amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of quarterdeck  urlabs and ibm s anti virus business with amortization of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
acquired in process research and development expenses in fiscal we acquired urlabs and l network security s operations 
in fiscal  we acquired ibm s and intel s anti virus businesses  binary s operations and quarterdeck 
we wrote off approximately million and million of acquired in process research and development associated with these acquisitions in fiscal and  respectively 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses 
we are using the acquired in process research and development associated with the fiscal acquisitions to create internet security intrusion detection  vulnerability assessment  new anti virus products and enhanced management and administrative capabilities to be integrated into our products over the next year 
there were no acquired in process research and development expenses in fiscal the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete these products in their entirety  or in a timely manner  we may not continue to attract new users  we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired 
we determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects  including the cost to complete the acquired in process technologies and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
a valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions in fiscal and as a result  we wrote off million and million in connection with our acquisitions of l network security and urlabs  respectively  in fiscal using the following analyses l network security this discussion contains forward looking statements of certain aspects of our future operating results from the operations of l network security l 
actual results may differ from the estimates expressly or implicitly referred to by these forward looking statements 
the in process technology acquired in the l acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of retriever and expert 
retriever and expert products are designed for assisting enterprises in vulnerability assessment 
l s research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of the next generation products of retriever and expert 
we plan on discontinuing sales of the expert product since many of its functionalities are expected to be largely superseded by the next generation of retriever 
we assumed that revenue attributable to l s in process technology would be approximately million in the first year and increase in the second and third years of the year projection period at annual rates of and  respectively  and then decrease at rates of  and  over the remaining three years 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the projected period 
these projections were based on aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  anticipated product development cycles  and the life of the underlying technology 
we estimated selling  general and administrative expenses for the in process technology to be of revenue in the first year  reducing to in each of the remaining years of the year projection period 
we projected operating results before acquisition related amortization charges to range from a million loss during the first year to a million profit during the third year 
the operating profits would then decrease in the fourth year to by the sixth year  resulting in profits of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
because we assumed that most product development costs would be incurred in the first year  thereby reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years  we anticipate that operating profit will increase faster than revenue in the early years 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of the in process technologies from l as of the date of the acquisition to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be between to complete at that time 
in addition  we began building an intrusion detection product leveraging l s core technology  which we plan to release in the second half of fiscal we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technologies from l  which we believe reflects the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of  due to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the technologies acquired from l were based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
urlabs this discussion contains forward looking statements of certain aspects of our future operating results from urlabs 
actual results may differ from the estimates expressly or implicitly referred to by these forward looking statements 
the in process technology acquired in the urlabs acquisition primarily consisted of research and development related to the next generation of urlabs two main products  i gear and mail gear the i gear and mail gear product lines are designed for content management use in url filtering and e mail filtering  respectively 
urlabs research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of the next generation products of i gear and mail gear we assumed that revenue attributable to urlabs in process technology would be approximately million in the first year and increase in the second and third years of the year projection period at annual rates of and  respectively  and then decrease at rates of and over the remaining two years 
we projected annual revenues to range from approximately million to million over the projected period 
these projections were based on aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  anticipated product development cycles  and the life of the underlying technology 
we estimated selling  general and administrative expenses for the in process technology to be approximately of revenue in the first year  reducing to approximately in each of the remaining years of the year projection period 
we projected operating profit before acquisition related amortization charges to increase from less than million during the first year to approximately million during the third year 
we projected that operating profits would then decrease from to during the remaining two years  resulting in profits of approximately million and million  respectively 
because we assumed that most product development costs would be incurred in the first year  reducing operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in later years  we anticipate operating profit to increase faster than revenue in the early years 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of the in process technologies from urlabs as of the date of the acquisition to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be between to complete at that time 
we projected the introduction of acquired in process technologies in the marketplace during calendar year  and it was introduced at the end of the december quarter 
we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technologies from urlabs  which we believe reflects the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of  due to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the rates used for urlabs are higher than the rates used for l due to differences in the economic environments at the time of each acquisition  such as the equities market and the interest rate environment 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the technologies acquired from urlabs were based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the risk factors set forth in this form k 
ibm the in process technology acquired in the ibm purchase primarily consisted of the ibm immune system technology and related anti virus patents 
we have integrated this technology into our anti virus products 
the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the immune system and related anti virus technology acquired from ibm have not significantly changed 
binary the in process technology acquired in the binary acquisition primarily consisted of disk cloning technologies associated with ghost  the flagship product of binary  which has been added to our product offerings 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the disk cloning technologies acquired from binary have not significantly changed 
intel the in process technology acquired in the intel purchase consists of the landesk anti virus technology  which resides in the landesk virus protect product line 
this technology has been integrated into our corporate anti virus offerings 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the landesk anti virus technology acquired from intel have not significantly changed 
quarterdeck the in process technology acquired in our acquisition of quarterdeck consisted of projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line 
these technologies have been integrated into norton systemworks and is sold as a stand alone product 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line have not significantly changed 
restructuring and other expenses during the march quarter  we reduced our operations in our melville and toronto sites  thereby reducing our workforce by employees 
each of these employees received a separation package 
as a result  we vacated the facility in melville and we are reducing the space occupied in toronto 
we recorded approximately million for employee severance  outplacement and abandonment of certain facilities and equipment during the march quarter 
in addition  we provided approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior management due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting departures during the march quarter 
during the december quarter  we reduced our internet tools business unit s workforce and reduced our sales workforce 
there were employees in the internet tools business unit affected  resulting in approximately million of severance  related benefits and outplacement services being accrued during the december quarter 
the sales workforce reduction affected employees  resulting in approximately million of severance  related benefits and outplacement services being accrued in the december quarter 
during the september quarter  we provided approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior management due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting departures 
we also accrued approximately million for certain costs related to an agreement reached with our former ceo in the june quarter 
these costs were comprised of severance and acceleration of unvested stock options 
during the september quarter  we made a decision to restructure our operations and outsource domestic manufacturing operations 
as a result  we originally recorded a million charge for personnel severance to reduce the workforce by approximately in both domestic and international operations and a million charge for the planned abandonment of a manufacturing facility lease 
these estimates were subsequently revised in the september quarter  resulting in a reduction in the personnel severance and outplacement accruals by approximately million 
there were no restructuring and other expenses incurred in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
litigation judgment during the june quarter  we accrued litigation expenses of approximately million related to a judgment by a canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of delrina corporation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense interest income was relatively flat at approximately million in fiscal  and interest expense was approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the interest expense in fiscal and was principally related to our convertible subordinated debentures  which were converted into our common stock in february and for interest on quarterdeck s subordinated notes that were paid off in march other income expense is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in fiscal there was approximately million in income due to gains on unhedged foreign currency exposures 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses accounted for approximately million in income in fiscal  which primarily resulted from the write off of the cumulative translation adjustment related to the payoff of an intercompany loan 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines the components of income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines are as follows year ended march  in thousands gain on divestiture of visual cafe product line  act product line  royalties from interact  transition fees payments from hp and jetform    income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines    gain on divestiture of visual cafe on december   we sold the principal assets and liabilities of the visual cafe product line to webgain  inc webgain 
the assets primarily consisted of fixed assets and intangible assets 
the liabilities related to certain revenue deferrals 
in exchange for the assets and liabilities sold to webgain  we received million in a lump sum cash payment on december  we wrote off or transferred approximately million of capitalized software  fixed assets and inventory related to the visual cafe product line 
in addition  we accrued approximately million in transaction costs and million in retention packages for the affected employees 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the divestiture 
gain on divestiture of act and royalties from interact on december   we licensed  on an exclusive basis  to interact commerce corporation  previously saleslogix corporation interact  substantially all of the act product line technology for a period of four years 
in addition  we sold the inventory and fixed assets related to the act product line to interact 
in consideration for the license and assets  interact transferred to us  shares of its unregistered common stock 
these shares were valued at approximately million as of december   the date the license was signed and the date the number of shares was determined 
as a result of the license  we recognized approximately million of income from the shares received and wrote off or transferred to interact approximately million of inventory and fixed assets attributed to the act product line 
in addition  we accrued approximately million for transaction related costs incurred at december  after recognizing the above amounts  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in addition to the shares received from interact  we will receive quarterly royalty payments for four years 
interact will pay these royalties based on future revenues  up to an aggregate maximum of million 
because the royalties are not guaranteed and the quarterly amounts to be received are not determinable until earned  we are recognizing these royalties  as payments are due 
the first payment of million  which was due and payable on march   was recorded as income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines in the march quarter 
the payment was subsequently received in the june quarter 
transition fees in accordance with individual transition agreements  webgain and interact will pay us a fee for invoicing  collecting receivables  shipping and other operational and support activities  until such time as they have the ability to take over these activities 
as of march   we billed them for a total amount of million 
approximately million of these fees were reimbursement of incremental costs incurred during the transition period to provide these services  which we would otherwise not have incurred  and as such  we have offset our operating expenses by this amount and have recorded the remaining amount of million in income  net of expenses  from sale of technologies and product lines 
payments from hp and jetform payments from hp and jetform are associated with our sale of certain software products  technologies and tangible assets to jetform corporation jetform and the hewlett packard company hp during fiscal the payments decreased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal these payments also decreased million from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the payments declined in fiscal and  because the hp payments ended in the december quarter and the payments from jetform have been declining in accordance with the payment terms 
the last jetform payment of approximately million was received in the june quarter 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income before one time charges acquired in process research and development and restructuring and other expenses  goodwill amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines  was for fiscal and our effective tax rate was for fiscal our fiscal and effective tax rates were lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on our irish operations 
in addition  our fiscal effective tax rate was lower due to the utilization of previously unbenefited losses and credits 
we project our effective tax rate to be in fiscal this projection  however  is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic allocation of earnings 
the effective tax rate on income after goodwill amortization  but before one time charges was  and for fiscal  and  respectively  reflecting the partial non deductibility of goodwill amortization in fiscal in addition  for fiscal  tax has been provided on the gain on sale of product lines at an effective tax rate of 
this rate is also lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is attributable to our irish operations and  accordingly  subject to a lower tax rate 
our tax provision for fiscal  and includes tax benefits attributable to one time charges of million  million and zero  respectively 
realization of a significant portion of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future us taxable income 
the amount of future us taxable income that would have to be generated in order to realize the net deferred tax assets is approximately million 
we believe it is more likely than not that the million of net deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future us taxable income 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the risk factors section of this form k 
a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments increased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase is largely due to cash provided from operations  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans  sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and the receipt of restricted stock and cash from our divestitures of the act and visual cafe product lines 
quarterdeck had issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes  or notes  due in these notes were issued to an institutional investor in a private placement pursuant to the terms of a note agreement dated march  these notes were paid in full on march  in addition to cash and short term investments  we have million of restricted investments related to collateral requirements under certain lease agreements 
we are obligated under these lease agreements for two office buildings in cupertino  california to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet our operating cash requirements 
we are in compliance with our covenants on these lease agreements as of march  future acquisitions or other events could cause us to be in violation of these covenants 
in may  we amended our million line of credit  which expires in may  to minimize the potential violation of certain financial covenants due to future acquisitions 
the amendment allows for future acquisitions of less than million in cash  annually 
we were in compliance with the debt covenants for this line of credit as of march  as of march   there were no borrowings and less than million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this line 
future acquisitions could cause us to be in violation of the line of credit covenants 
however  we believe that if the line of credit is canceled or amounts are not available under the line  there will not be a material adverse impact on our financial results  liquidity or capital resources 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and was comprised of net income of approximately million  non cash related expenses of million and a net increase in assets and liabilities of million 
net trade accounts receivable decreased million to approximately million and to days sales outstanding at march  from approximately million and days sales outstanding at march  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and was comprised of million in proceeds from our divestiture of the visual cafe product line  offset by million in payments made in connection with our recent acquisitions  million in net purchases of marketable securities and million of capital expenditures 
on june   the board of directors of symantec authorized the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock before december  we completed the repurchase as of october   repurchasing approximately million shares for approximately million at prices ranging from to per share 
the repurchased shares were used for employee stock purchase programs and option grants 
on march   the board authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of march   we have purchased million shares at prices ranging from to  for an aggregate amount of million 
we believe that existing cash and short term investments and cash generated from operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers the adoption of sfas no 
for one year 
sfas will be effective for symantec at the beginning of the june quarter for both annual and interim reporting periods 
we are evaluating the potential impact of this accounting pronouncement on our required disclosures and accounting practices 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of opinion no 
for certain issues including a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
in general  this interpretation is effective july  we do not expect the adoption of interpretation no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in march  the sec released sab no 
a  which defers reporting the effects of the adoption of sab no 
until our first fiscal quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact of sab no 
on our required disclosures and accounting practices 
business risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others things  those risk factors set forth in this section and elsewhere in this report 
we identify forward looking statements by words such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue or similar terms that refer to the future 
we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our increased sales of enterprise wide site licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results 
sales of enterprise wide site licenses through our enterprise solutions segment are a major and expanding portion of our business 
this enterprise market has significantly different characteristics than the consumer market and requires different skills and resources to penetrate 
licensing arrangements tend to involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we recently restructured our internal focus and operations and we could incur adverse operating consequences as a result of these changes 
in fiscal  we restructured our operations on the basis of a customer segment orientation rather than a product structure 
we also divested two product lines that did not fit with our future focus 
changes of this nature inevitably cause disruptions within an organization that may adversely affect results as the changes are being absorbed  and these changes may not achieve their desired long term benefits 
overseeing these changes requires significant attention from our senior management and may detract from management s ability to focus on other important opportunities or problems that might confront us 
we have lost personnel  including management  and we may continue to do so as a consequence of these types of changes 
in addition  we may not be able to introduce new products that are as beneficial to us as those that we divested 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation  and future sales  harmed if these efforts are successful 
our markets are highly competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by this competition 
our markets are intensely competitive 
this competition could adversely affect our operating results by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products 
recently many of our competitors have significantly reduced the price of utility and anti virus products and further price reductions could occur for these or other of our products  which would likely have a negative affect on our margins and could reduce our sales 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance our products or produce new products that are compatible with new products introduced by the major hardware and operating system providers 
we have no control  and sometimes limited visibility  into the development efforts of these third parties and we may not be able to respond effectively or timely to their new products and enhancements 
in addition  we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to how to best allocate our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets 
we may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect 
we may fail to allocate resources to third party products or to markets that are more successful than we anticipate 
introduction of new operating systems may adversely affect our financial results and stock price 
the inclusion of security or anti virus tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales 
for example  the inclusion of features by microsoft in new or upcoming versions of windows  such as current and future editions of windows  which directly compete with our products  may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development and products specifically intended for windows additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for some of our products  including those currently under development 
our financial results and our stock price declined significantly within approximately six months after the releases of windows  windows and windows  which in some cases also caused the additional requirement for hardware upgrades that resulted in shifts in customer spending from software to hardware 
the professional edition of windows was released in february  and  as a result  we could face adverse financial results and additional stock price declines 
with the rise of linux based operating systems being introduced into the market  we may lose market share if we are unable to significantly penetrate the linux based market timely and effectively 
our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations 
due to the factors noted throughout this section  our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
there have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
while our diverse product line has tended to lessen fluctuations in quarterly net revenues  these fluctuations have occurred in the past  and may occur in the future 
fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software markets  and the market s transition between operating systems 
a significant portion of our net revenues have historically been generated during the last month of a fiscal quarter 
most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because these two groups are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
in addition  these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts 
we face risks associated with our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our net revenues  manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
as a result  our operating results may be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each country s political and economic structure 
in addition  the laws of some other countries do not protect intellectual property rights as effectively as is the case in the united states and we may be subject to a greater risk of unauthorized use of our products 
we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment 
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market  which  in turn  is dependent on further acceptance of the internet 
the following critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  or potential tax or other government regulations 
in addition  new technologies  such as non pc based internet access devices and handheld organizers are gaining acceptance 
we must adapt to these changing technological demands 
if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the internet and non pc based environments  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain 
we believe that we will need to incur significant research and development expenditures to remain competitive 
the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful 
in addition  the length of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected 
we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
if they are not technologically successful  our resulting products may not achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors 
we are dependent upon certain distribution channels 
a large portion of our sales is made through the retail distribution channel  which is subject to events that create unpredictability in consumer demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
our retail distribution customers also carry our competitors products 
these retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory 
their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control nor can we predict 
our agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause 
we would be adversely affected if companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our competition relative to the amount they buy from us 
some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial difficulties in the future 
if these distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors  we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in utilizing new distribution channels 
we currently offer a broad range of products and services over the internet  which is a relatively new distribution channel for our business 
we may not be able to effectively adapt our existing  or adopt new  methods of distributing our software products utilizing the rapidly evolving internet and related technologies 
the adoption of new channels may adversely impact existing channels and or product pricing  which may reduce our future revenues and profitability 
channel fill and product returns may negatively affect our net revenues 
our pattern of net revenues and earnings may be affected by channel fill 
distributors may fill their distribution channels in anticipation of price increases  sales promotions or incentives 
channels may also become filled simply because the distributors do not sell their inventories to retail distribution or from retailers to end users as anticipated 
if sales to retailers or end users do not occur at a sufficient rate  distributors will delay purchases or cancel orders in later periods or return prior purchases in order to reduce their inventories 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to various limitations  to return purchased products in exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products through dealers and distributors within a reasonable period from the date of purchase for a full refund 
in addition  subject to limitations  retailers may return older versions of our products 
we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns 
future returns could  however  exceed the reserves we have established  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
the transition to integrated suites of utilities may result in reduced consumer revenues 
we and our competitors sell integrated suites of utility products for prices significantly less than the aggregate price of the stand alone products that are included in these suites when sold separately 
as a result of the shift to integrated utility suites  price competition is intense in the consumer market and we have experienced cannibalization of our stand alone products that are included within the suite 
additionally  our products may not compete effectively with competitors integrated suites introduced in the future 
we depend on our internal communications systems that may be disrupted 
our order entry and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters or the interruption in service by communications carriers 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
communications and internet connectivity disruptions may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
we are involved in litigation  and may in the future be involved in litigation  which could adversely affect our financial results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  that our products are not year compliant or other product liability claims  or other claims incidental to our business 
we are currently involved in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings 
for a discussion of our current litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously 
we may suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
defects and errors could be found in current versions of our products  future upgrades to current products or newly developed and released products 
software defects could result in delays in market acceptance or unexpected reprogramming costs  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions limiting our liability may not be valid as a result of federal  state  local or foreign laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
the trend toward consolidation in our industry may impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software solutions 
changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive condition 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines  and skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 
we have grown  and may continue to grow through acquisitions  which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results 
we have made seven acquisitions within the last two fiscal years and may complete material acquisitions in the future 
integrating acquired businesses into our existing business may distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges 
our past acquisitions have given rise to  and future acquisitions may result in  substantial levels of goodwill and other intangible assets that will be amortized in future years and our future operating results will be adversely affected if we do not achieve benefits from these acquisitions commensurate with these charges 
in addition  a number of our recent acquisitions have resulted in our incurring substantial write offs of acquired in process research and development costs and this also may occur as a result of future acquisitions 
we may issue equity  or incur debt financing  for future acquisitions that are dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we must attract and retain personnel while competition for personnel in our industry is intense 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel  particularly as we focus on enterprise wide applications 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options  which requires ongoing stockholder approval 
such approval may not be forthcoming and  as a result  we may be impaired in our efforts to attract necessary personnel 
we may experience disruption of our internal systems as a result of the year in order to prepare for the year  we completed a major evaluation of our internal applications  systems and databases 
we modified or replaced portions of our hardware and associated software to enable our operational systems and networks to function properly with respect to dates january  and thereafter 
the cost to complete the year project was approximately million and has been expensed as incurred 
we will continue to evaluate interfaces between our systems and third party systems  such as those of key suppliers  distributors and financial institutions  for year functionality 
although the year rollover did not cause any significant problems  as discussed below  we may still encounter problems as operations uncover processes not yet utilized 
in addition  the systems of other companies with which we do business may not have completely addressed year problems 
based on this  we expect the process of evaluating third party year compliance to be ongoing 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses 
we regard our software as proprietary and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
like many companies in the software industry  technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses 
over the short term  we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
further customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates because of the low levels of marketable securities on our balance sheet 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of march   the fair market value of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately us million and euro million 
sensitivity analysis for a six month horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate liabilities 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis point of our weighted average interest rate would result in changes in fair market values for these investments and floating rate liabilities of less than million 
for the euro investments  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis point of our weighted average interest rate would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately less than euro million 
equity sensitivity we are exposed to equity price risk on the marketable portion of our portfolio of equity securities 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on our securities 
as of march   these securities consisted of approximately  shares of interact commerce corporation  a publicly traded company nasdaq symbol iact  with a market value of approximately million 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the prices of these securities could experience a adverse change in the near term 
assuming a adverse change  these securities would decrease in value by approximately million  based on the value of the securities as of march  since april  many high technology stocks experienced increased volatility and a significant decrease in value  including these shares 
if these securities had been valued using prices as of june   the value of these securities would have decreased by approximately an additional million subsequent to march  the value of these securities may vary over time and the value as of june  of approximately million is not necessarily indicative of future performance 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  or forward contracts  of one fiscal month duration to hedge various foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts to mitigate the risk of material foreign currency transaction losses 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
at the end of each fiscal month  all foreign currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the month end spot rate of the maturing forward contracts and the realized gains and losses are recorded and included in net income as a component of other income expense 
we believe that the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we use sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact market risk exposure may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments  principally forward contracts 
the sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six month horizon 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
as of march   the net fair value liability of our foreign currency financial instruments was approximately us million 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately us million or an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments by approximately us million 
this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments
