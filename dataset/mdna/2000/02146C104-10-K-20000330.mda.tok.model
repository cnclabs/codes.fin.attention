item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading national assisted living company operating assisted living residences and providing assisted living services in states 
our growth in recent years has had a significant impact on our results of operations and accounts for most of the changes in our results between and as of december  and  we operated or managed and residences with aggregate capacity of approximately  and  residents  respectively 
we  together with other parties who have purchased interests in some of our development residences  were also constructing or developing additional residences with additional capacity for  residents as of december  during  we generated operating revenue of million and realized operating income of million and net income of million prior to a non recurring charge  other one time adjustments  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to implement several strategic initiatives designed to strengthen our balance sheet and to enable us to focus on stabilizing and enhancing our core business operations 
the principal components of these strategic initiatives include reduced development activity 
in light of the competitive environment and tightening capital markets  we elected to significantly reduce the scope of our assisted living development activities 
specifically  in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we have discontinued development activity with respect to a substantial number of development sites 
as a consequence of this decision  we recorded one time  non recurring  pre tax charges of million million net of income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of reflecting i our write down of the carrying costs of discontinued development sites and failed acquisitions  ii costs associated with the planned reduction in development activities and the discontinuation of operations of our wholly owned construction subsidiary  iii our write off of deferred financing costs associated with construction loan credit lines that will not be fully utilized  and iv a reserve established against our note receivable with a development joint venture resulting from the reduction of a previously established financing commitment with that joint venture 
reduced reliance upon joint venture arrangements 
in order to simplify our capital structure  we have elected to reduce our utilization of joint venture development arrangements and other off balance sheet ownership and development structures so called black box structures 
historically  these arrangements were a source of fee income for us and served to reduce the adverse impact on our earnings of start up losses associated with our substantial volume of newly opened residences 
we believe  however  that we can improve our future cash flow and liquidity by retaining of the revenue and operating cash flow from more of our residences 
deleveraging of our balance sheet 
we are seeking to strengthen and deleverage our balance sheet and to address our short and long term capital needs by securing an additional equity or equity linked investment in the company 
we have retained financial advisors to assist us in securing this investment  and are currently in negotiations with parties interested in making an investment in the company 
focus on cash flow 
as our portfolio of assisted living residences stabilizes and matures  we intend to focus on cash flow 
in this regard  we will seek to own as opposed to lease as much of our real estate as we can  given our capital constraints 
ownership of a greater percentage of our residences will increase depreciation and amortization expenses but only impact our operating cash flow to the extent of any related interest expense 
we are currently seeking to address both our short and long term liquidity requirements 
the combination of a difficult financing and operating environment healthcare service companies has significantly reduced the company s access to credit 
a number of the company s traditional financing sources  including commercial banks and other secured lenders  have substantially reduced their lending activities to the healthcare sector 
in addition  the credit availability under certain of our credit facilities has either been reduced or eliminated due to a variety of factors  including our request for modifications of some of our financial covenants in certain of our credit agreements 
to address our need for capital  we are in the process of seeking to raise at least million of equity or equity linked financing  and expect to consummate such a transaction during the second quarter of given that we have not committed to a specific equity transaction with any of our prospective investors  there is a risk that we will not complete an equity transaction 
however  given the high level of interest of our prospective investors  the advanced stage of these negotiations and the familiarity and understanding that these prospective investors have with respect to our company and business  our management team believes that the company has the ability to complete a substantial equity investment transaction in the second quarter of if we are not able to consummate this equity transaction in a timely fashion  we may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our future operations and other obligations 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  residence service fees 
residence service fees for the year ended december  were million representing an increase of million  or  from the million for substantially all of this increase resulted from the addition of newly constructed residences  residences we acquired the majority ownership interest in during  and other residences we acquired 
we operated or managed and residences at december  and  respectively 
other revenues 
other revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the million of other revenue for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to management fees on an increased number of residences which were either managed for third parties or operated in minority joint ventures in versus as of december   we had residences held in minority joint ventures or managed for other owners as compared to residences as of december  management fees include charges for transitional services to recruit and train staff  initial and recurring fees for use of our name and branding  initial and recurring fees for use of our methodologies  and services for assisting with finance processing  which are incurred during the start up period of a new residence  and ongoing management services provided to operate the residence 
residence operating expenses 
residence operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million in  due to the increased number of residences operated during operating expenses as a percentage of residence service fees  for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
lease expense 
lease expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the utilization of additional sale leaseback financing totaling million during and to the incurrence of a full year of lease expense in related to leases entered into in lease income 
we recorded lease income on residences we owned and leased to unconsolidated joint ventures of million for the year ended  versus million for under this arrangement  we retain ownership in underlying assets in order to allow the use of our corporate financing arrangements 
lease payment obligations of the unconsolidated joint venture entities are approximately equivalent to the debt service payable by us on the leased residences  which thereby  offset our costs associated with retaining ownership in the fixed assets 
as of december   we had unconsolidated joint ventures compared to as of december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million prior to a write off of million for failed acquisitions  corporate downsizing  and corporate office relocation costs  compared to million for  representing an increase as a percentage of operating revenue to in from in the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to salaries  related payroll taxes and employee benefits for additional corporate personnel retained to support our growth and to support the increased number of unconsolidated residences we manage 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million prior to a  write off due to the relocation of our national headquarters  representing an increase of  or  from the million of depreciation and amortization for this increase resulted primarily from depreciation of fixed assets on the larger number of new residences that were operated by us during the year ended december   versus the increase in depreciation is partially offset by the elimination of amortization on pre opening costs which are now expensed when they are incurred 
depreciation and amortization in includes million of amortization of pre opening costs 
as discussed below  we adopted a new accounting principle related to pre opening costs on january  non recurring charge 
we recorded a non recurring charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decision to exit development activities 
the charge consists of the write off of million in costs already incurred on development projects that will not be completed and the establishment of million in reserves for costs related to exiting these activities 
in addition  the charge includes a million reserve for employee costs and lease obligations associated with closing down our construction subsidiary and related activities at the national office 
the company also established a million reserve related to a development joint venture with manor care  inc which is further discussed in note interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million for the year ended december  prior to a million write off of deferred financing commitment fees  compared to million for gross interest expense before interest capitalization and interest income for the period was million prior to the commitment fee write off  compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of mortgage financing used in as compared to we capitalized million of interest expense in compared to million in this decrease is a result of our decision to reduce development and construction activity in we opened newly constructed residences during the year ended december  compared to newly constructed residences in interest income for was million as compared to million for minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of residences in various stages of lease up that we owned in majority owned joint venture arrangements 
throughout  we had an average of residences held in these majority owned joint venture arrangements compared to an average of residences held in similar majority owned joint venture arrangements during the year ended december  income taxes 
for  we recorded a current income tax benefit of  and recognized a million deferred asset resulting in a current income tax benefit of million before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
for  we recorded a current income tax provision of million which was offset by the recognition of million of deferred tax assets resulting in a current income tax expense of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
during the first quarter of  we incurred a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the adoption of sop  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization costs be expensed as incurred 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income prior to the previously mentioned one time write offs of million million pre tax  the non recurring charge of million million pre tax and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million net of tax  was million compared to net income of million for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resident service fees 
resident services fees for the year ended december  were million representing an increase of million  or  from the million for substantially all of this increase resulted from the addition of newly constructed residences and other residences we acquired 
we operated or managed and residences at december  and  respectively 
other revenues 
other revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million over the million of other revenue for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to management fees on an increased number of residences which were either managed for third parties or operated in minority joint ventures in versus as of december   we had residences operated in minority joint ventures or managed for other owners as compared to of these residences on december  the increase in other revenue was also impacted by new residences opened under franchise arrangements in and fees recognized from a development arrangement in residence operating expenses 
residence operating expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million in due to the increased number of residences operated during operating expenses as a percentage of resident service fees for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
lease expense 
lease expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to the utilization of additional sale leaseback financing totaling million during the twelve month period ended december  sublease income 
we recorded million of lease income on residences we owned and leased to unconsolidated joint ventures in under this arrangement  we retain ownership in underlying assets in order to allow the use of our corporate financing arrangements 
lease payment obligations of the unconsolidated joint venture entities are approximately equivalent to the debt service payable by us on the leased residences  which thereby  offset our costs associated with retaining ownership in the fixed assets 
we had no similar arrangements in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million  before sterling merger related charges of million  for this represents a decline as a percentage of operating revenue to in from in the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to salaries  related payroll taxes and employee benefits for additional corporate personnel retained to support our actual and anticipated growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  from the million of depreciation and amortization for this increase resulted primarily from depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of pre opening costs on the larger number of new residences that we operated during the year ended december   versus we previously amortized pre opening costs over a twelve month period from the date the residence opened 
upon the adoption of the aicpa statement of position no 
reporting on the costs of start up activities  on january   we expensed pre opening costs  as defined  when incurred 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for gross interest expense before interest capitalization and interest income for was million compared to million for  an increase of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the issuance in may of the convertible subordinated debentures due  the debentures the issuance in december of the convertible subordinated debentures due  the debentures and an increase in the amount of mortgage financing used in as compared to we capitalized million of interest expense in compared to million in due to increased construction activity in we opened newly constructed residences during the year ended december  compared to newly constructed residences opened in interest income for was million as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to the investment of proceeds received from the december concurrent convertible debt and equity offering 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million from million for the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of residences in various stages of lease up that we owned in majority owned joint venture arrangements 
throughout  we had an average of residences held in these majority owned joint venture arrangements compared to an average of residences held in similar majority owned joint venture arrangements during the year ended december  income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a current income tax provision of million which was offset by the recognition of million of deferred tax assets resulting in a current income tax expense of million 
the deferred tax asset recognition was generated primarily due to the elimination of valuation allowances associated with net deferred tax assets in and prior 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  the net income for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million for liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million at december  for the year ended december   cash flow from operations was million versus an operating cash flow deficit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flow from operating activities is attributable to the greater number of consolidated residences operating at or near stabilized occupancy levels during in comparison to and during  we closed on approximately million of new debt financing and capital lease obligations which included approximately million of debt used to refinance properties having prior debt balances of million 
additionally  financing was provided through million of sale leaseback financing  million of minority joint venture partner contributions and million of bridge loan financing 
net cash provided by these financing activities together with cash from operations was used during to fund million in construction and development activity  million in joint venture buyouts  million in acquisition activity and million of construction bridge financing that we provided to others under third party development arrangements 
historically  we have financed our operations and growth through a combination of various forms of real estate financing mortgage  synthetic lease and sale leaseback financing  capital contributions from joint venture partners and the sale of our securities common stock and convertible debentures  and  to a lesser extent  cash from operations 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt principally consisting of million of convertible debentures having a weighted average interest rate of  million of fixed rate debt having a weighted average interest rate of  capitalized lease obligations of million having a weighted average interest rate of  million of variable rate debt having a weighted average interest rate of and short term borrowings of approximately million 
through december   we have also entered into approximately million of sale leaseback and synthetic lease financings 
in addition  we have guaranteed an aggregate of million of indebtedness of joint venture and other off balance sheet third party entities 
during we completed a synthetic lease transaction relating to assisted living and alzheimer s dementia care residences that were previously owned and operated by manor care  inc pursuant to this transaction  an affiliate of a commercial bank acquired the residences for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including closing costs and simultaneously leased the residences to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
our lease of these residences has a term of ten years  reflects initial rental based on a lease constant of and contains an option to purchase the residences at the end of the lease term for a pre negotiated fixed price 
for financial accounting purposes  leases for of the residences have been treated as operating leases and leases for nine residences were treated as capital leases 
we have the following three series of convertible subordinated debentures outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due december  these convertible debentures bear interest at per annum payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
the conversion price is  which is equivalent to a conversion ratio of shares of common stock per  in principal amount of the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures are redeemable at our option commencing on december   at specified premiums 
the holders of the convertible debentures may require us to repurchase the convertible dentures at of face value upon a change of control of the company  as defined in the convertible debenture  million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due june  these convertible debentures bear interest at per annum payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
the conversion price is  which is equivalent to a conversion ratio of shares of common stock per  in principal amount of the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures are redeemable at our option commencing on june   at specified premiums  and million aggregate principal amount convertible subordinated debentures due june  these convertible debentures bear interest at per annual payable semi annually on june and december of each year 
the conversion price is  which is equivalent to a conversion ratio of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures are redeemable at our option commencing on july   at specified premiums 
our principal credit and financing agreements  including our convertible debentures and our synthetic lease agreements  include cross default provisions that provide that a material default under our other credit facilities constitute a default under that credit or financing agreement 
accordingly  any material default arising under one of our credit or financing agreements could result in many of our other major credit and financing arrangements being in default 
in addition  our principal credit agreements and debt instruments include various financial covenants and other restrictions  including i fixed charge coverage requirements  typically measured on a trailing four quarter basis and which generally increase over the term of the applicable credit agreement  ii maximum leverage ratios which limit our aggregate senior indebtedness to total capitalization  iii various minimum net worth or tangible net worth requirements  iv in certain cases  property specific debt service coverage requirements and similar financial covenants of the type referenced above applicable to individual properties or to the pool of residences financed by the applicable lender  and v the maintenance of operating and other reserves for the benefit of the residences serving as collateral for the applicable lender 
in addition  under certain of our credit and sale leaseback facilities we are required to secure lender or lessor consent prior to engaging in certain mergers  business combinations or change in control transactions 
as noted below  as a result of the non recurring charges taken in the fourth quarter of and reductions in our expected future earnings resulting from our decision to reduce development and utilization of off balance sheet joint venture structures  we would have been in violation of net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants imposed by several of our lenders had we not secured modifications or waivers of these covenants 
our operations and remaining construction activity will require significant additional capital resources in the future in order to fund i our remaining construction of assisted living and alzheimer s care residences  ii our purchase from the third party joint venture partners of minority and majority equity interests in assisted living residences operated by us  iii our ongoing debt service obligations  including maturities of our long term debt and refinancing of short term debt  and iv our obligation to finance the operations of third party development partners 
each of these principal uses of capital resources are summarized below development activities 
the development and construction of new  purpose built assisted living and alzheimer s care residences has historically been the principal use of the company s capital resources 
although we elected to discontinue a significant portion of our pending development projects  we are continuing to construct and complete approximately residences currently in construction and development 
we estimate that between million and million will be required to fund our ongoing construction during the twelve month period ending december  and that other entities for whom we are constructing residences will need to fund between million and million during that same time period 
purchase of joint venture interests 
we are obligated under many of our joint venture arrangements to purchase the equity interests of our joint venture partners at fair market value upon the election of our partners 
during the next twelve months  we will be subject to contingent purchase obligations with respect to equity interests held by joint venture partners  exercisable at their election  related to approximately of our residences 
at designated times or earlier  as contingent purchase obligations are exercisable  we may also elect to exercise our rights to purchase these interests 
based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions as to the number of residences to be operated with joint venture partners  the timing of completion of development  the time at which these options may be exercised and the fair market value of these residences at the date these options are exercised  we estimate that we may need approximately million to million to satisfy these purchase obligations during the twelve month period ending december  debt service 
in addition to ongoing debt service and lease payment obligations  including interest payments due on our convertible debentures  we will be required to fund or refinance approximately million of short term indebtedness and million of long term indebtedness that will mature during the twelve month period ending december  as of december   we had outstanding approximately million of debt currently held by two lenders which includes provisions requiring us to repay a portion of the debt if the operating cash flow from the residences financed by such debt falls below specified levels  which we expect to occur 
the repayment of a portion of this debt was scheduled to occur in march and august of we have preliminary understandings with the two lenders holding the debt that the terms of such debt will be modified during to eliminate any required repayment in exchange for shortening the maturity date of such debt to approximately two years and converting the pricing on such debt to a floating rate structure 
if these modifications had been effected as of march   the floating rate would be approximately 
prior to these anticipated modifications  this debt would mature in approximately years and would bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining the modifications described above of this debt 
advances to development partners 
we have committed to provide up to million in financing to development partners under third party arrangements 
we have advanced million pursuant to these arrangements as of december  subject to resolving any pending loan covenant issues  we intend to finance or refinance these projects under existing or future bank credit facilities 
we expect to fund a portion of our capital and liquidity requirements from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  financing under existing debt and lease commitments and  to a limited extent  equity from our joint venture development partners 
our ability to utilize previously secured non binding financing commitments from reits and other lenders has become substantially limited due in part to our request and receipt of modifications of some of the lenders financial covenants  the volatility in the capital markets and factors affecting the assisted living industry generally 
in particular  one of our construction loan facilities has delayed advances due on ongoing construction pending the resolution of a number of loan facility capacity and residence construction issues 
in addition  many healthcare reits and lenders are currently not extending new financing and the property level underwriting requirements of certain of our lenders are being more strictly applied 
accordingly  our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms has become increasingly difficult 
we currently expect to have access to no more than to million of additional mortgage financing from existing construction loan facilities during the twelve month period ending december  we do not expect to have access to any significant sale leaseback financing during the twelve month period ending december  we are seeking to address our anticipated shortfall of our capital resources to fund anticipated capital needs through the sale of at least million of additional equity or equity linked securities of the company 
we have retained investment bankers to assist us in identifying possible sources of equity capital and to structure and negotiate an appropriate transaction 
although we have had and are continuing to have discussions with a number of potential investors  we are currently engaged in detailed negotiations with two investor groups  both of which include existing shareholders of the company 
we believe these investor groups have access to substantial financial resources and have a history of making investments in the senior housing and assisted living industries 
while the transactions proposed by these two groups vary  we expect that these transactions may involve either the issuance of convertible preferred stock or convertible debentures of the company  each convertible into our common stock 
in the case of convertible debentures  these debt securities would rank senior to our million of subordinated convertible debentures and would accrue interest payable by the issuance of additional convertible debentures of the company 
in the case of convertible preferred stock  these equity securities would rank senior to all other classes of our capital stock and would be entitled to quarterly dividends payable by the issuance of additional shares of convertible preferred stock 
accordingly  we expect this transaction would be dilutive to the current common stockholders of the company 
any equity transaction likely would be subject to various conditions  including i modification of certain financial covenants or other structural amendments in some of our credit agreements to provide the company more flexibility in executing our business plan  ii the commitment of certain of our lenders to extend maturities as well as to resume funding of their credit facilities in the ordinary course  and iii various contractual consents and approvals 
given that we have not committed to a specific equity transaction with any of our prospective investors  there is a risk that we will not complete an equity transaction 
however  given the high level of interest of our prospective investors  the advanced stage of these negotiations and the familiarity and understanding that these prospective investors have with respect to our company and business  our management team believes that the company has the ability to complete an equity investment transaction in the second quarter of we have taken several steps to maintain sufficient operational liquidity pending finalizing and funding an equity transaction 
these steps have included i stopping and or slowing construction in progress in order to reduce construction related spending  ii borrowing million pursuant to bridge loan financing  and iii allowing construction related payables to build up over normal levels 
notwithstanding these measures  one of our principal construction lenders has delayed making further advances on five residences currently in construction 
as a result  liens have been filed on these construction projects resulting in defaults under the operative construction loan credit agreements 
although the company has obtained waivers through june  of these defaults  payment of these suppliers and contractors will need to be effected in in order to permanently resolve these defaults 
in addition  additional liens or lawsuits may be filed by contractors and subcontractors unless the advances under the credit facility are resumed  which additional liens or lawsuits will in turn result in further defaults under the operative credit agreements 
moreover  although the stopping or slowing of construction in progress has helped to preserve operating liquidity  upon resuming construction we may incur increased costs in order to complete construction 
due to the fourth quarter non recurring charges and the anticipated reduction in our projected earnings due to planned reduction in development activity and reduced utilization of off balance sheet joint venture structures  we would have been in violation of some of the financial covenants in our major credit facilities 
however  we have obtained from these lenders either suspensions  amendments or waivers of net worth or fixed charge coverage covenants in order to avoid any actual default under these agreements and provide relief to the company through june  these suspensions  amendments and waivers impose various conditions on the company  including the requirement to secure equity or equity linked funding of at least million on or before june  and  in the case of one lender group  to have secured a written commitment with respect to an equity transaction during the second quarter 
to secure these accommodations from our lenders  we have i agreed to pay various fees both in form of cash and other consideration as well as established additional cash reserves  ii increased the pricing on some of our financing  some of which increases are permanent and others of which are temporary pending the completion of our contemplated equity transaction  iii shortened the maturity dates on some of our financing  iv delayed or waived our receipt of management fees and reimbursement of operating costs of residences serving as collateral  and v consented to the reduction of existing financing commitments of some of our lenders 
if we are unable to finalize negotiations with an investor with respect to an equity transaction or if we are unable to satisfy the conditions to a proposed equity investment  the company will need to seek to address its significant short and long term liquidity shortfall through various measures  which may include further debt restructuring  sale of assets on an expedited basis  the surrender of collateral to certain of our lenders and further reduction of overhead generally 
however  we are not able to provide any assurance that  without a significant equity transaction  the company will be able to satisfy its short term or long term liquidity needs 
in addition  as we are seeking to finalize and complete an equity transaction  we will need access to further advances under our construction lines  further extensions of terms by construction related creditors and access to further bridge financing 
we believe that upon executing and announcing a definitive agreement with respect to an equity transaction that we will be able to work with various of our lenders and lessors pending the closing and funding of the equity transaction 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to reach an accommodation with all of our lenders and lessors to accomplish this objective 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on us 
inflation could  however  affect our results of operations due to our dependence on our senior resident population who rely on liquid assets and relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
as a result  we may not be able to increase residence service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring our fees  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures 
in addition  given the significant amount of construction and development activity which we anticipate  inflationary pressures could affect our cost of new product deployment and financing 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we performed a sensitivity analysis which presents the hypothetical change in fair value of those financial instruments held by us at december  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from an immediate hypothetical one percentage point parallel shift in the yield curve 
the fair value of the debt included in the analysis is million 
although not expected  a one percentage point change in the interest rates would have caused our annual interest expense to change by approximately million 
accordingly  a significant increase in london inter bank offered rate libor could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
although a majority of the debt and lease payment obligations we have as of  or during the twelve months ended  december  are not subject to floating interest rates  indebtedness that we may incur in the future may bear interest at a floating rate 
debt and annual operating lease payment obligations will continue to increase significantly as we complete our pending development and construction activity 
we expect to refinance million of our fixed rate debt in and  as a result  convert this into variable rate debt 
we do not presently use financial derivative instruments to manage our interest costs 
we do not use foreign currency exchange rate forward contracts or commodity contracts and do not have foreign currency exposure as of december
