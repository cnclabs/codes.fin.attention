fic s primary sources of capital consists of cash flow from operations of its subsidiaries and the proceeds from bank and institutional borrowings 
the principal source of liquidity for fic s subsidiaries consists of the periodic payment of principal and interest by family life pursuant to the terms of a surplus debenture 
the terms of the surplus debenture were previously approved by the washington insurance commissioner 
under the provisions of the surplus debenture and current law  no prior approval of the washington insurance department is required for family life to pay interest or principal on the surplus debenture  provided that  after giving effect to such payments  the statutory surplus of family life is in excess of of assets the surplus floor 
however  family life has voluntarily agreed with the washington insurance commissioner that it will provide at least five days advance notice of payments which it will make under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the statutory capital and surplus of family life was million  an amount substantially in excess of the surplus floor 
during  family life made principal payments of million and interest payments of million to family life corporation under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the principal balance of the surplus debenture was million 
the funds required by family life to meet its obligations under the terms of the surplus debenture are generated primarily from premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
washington s insurance code includes the greater of standard for dividends but has requirements that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
family life does not presently have earned surplus as defined by the regulations adopted by the washington insurance commissioner and  therefore  is not permitted to pay cash dividends 
however  since the new law applies only to dividend payments  the ability of family life to make principal and interest payments under the surplus debenture is not affected 
the company does not anticipate that family life will have any difficulty in making principal and interest payments on the surplus debenture in the amounts necessary to enable family life corporation to service its indebtedness for the foreseeable future 
the sources of funds for family life consist of premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
these funds are applied primarily to provide for the payment of claims under insurance and annuity policies  operating expenses  taxes  investments in portfolio securities  shareholder dividends and payments under the provisions of the surplus debenture 
fic s net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year  as compared to million in and million in net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in the guaranty commitments of fic under the loans incurred in connection with the acquisition of family life after taking into account the repayments and new loans which occurred in july  relate to i the million note issued by family life corporation to investors life insurance company of north america and ii the million loaned by investors na to two subsidiaries of fic 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet the needs of its business and to satisfy debt service 
investments as of december   the company s investment assets totaled million  as compared to million as of december  the level of short term investments at the end of was million  as compared to million as of december  the fixed maturities available for sale portion represents million of investment assets as of december   as compared to million at the end of the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale as of december  was million representing a net unrealized loss of million 
this unrealized loss principally reflects changes in interest rates from the date the respective investments were purchased 
to reduce the exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so that diversity  maturity and liquidity factors approximate the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the assets held by family life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
the fixed maturities portfolio of family life  as of december   consisted solely of fixed maturities investments which  in the annual statements of the companies  as filed with state insurance departments  were designated under the national association of insurance commissioners naic rating system as a highest quality 
prior to december   fic owned several parcels of real estate in jackson  mississippi  adjacent to an office building known as the standard life building  which building was owned by investors na 
this building is years old and contains approximately  square feet  net rentable square feet of office space 
on december   investors na donated the standard life building to the jackson redevelopment authority jra 
contemporaneously with the donation of the standard life building  investors na and fic sold all of the adjacent parcels they owned to the jra for a total sale price of  which has been allocated according to the respective ownership interests of investors na approximately and fic approximately 
the donation and sale was made pursuant to the terms of the donation  purchase and sale agreement dated july  investors na intends to claim an income tax deduction on its upcoming tax return for the donation of the standard life building  which has an appraised value at december  of approximately 
the donation and sale transaction referenced above resulted in a net gain gaap basis of million for ilco and million for fic or a combined total of million 
management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiary enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders 
year compliance the company and its subsidiaries utilize a centralized computer system to process policyholder records and financial information 
in addition  the company uses non centralized computer terminals in connection with its operations 
in response to the potential operations and policy administration problems caused by the calendar change on january   the company evaluated its centralized computer systems and developed a plan to reach yk compliance the year plan 
a central feature of the plan was to convert certain of the centralized systems to a common system which is already in compliance with yk requirements 
the year plan called for an upgrade of the family life s administrative systems by changing individual lines of computer code in order to modify current operating software such that it would become yk compliant 
this process included approximately sub systems which provide data input to the main systems 
the administrative systems which were not modified were converted onto the company s ck system  a system designed to be yk compliant according to the representations of the vendor 
the company completed this systems conversion and testing prior to january  for the year ended december   the company incurred an after tax expense of approximately  in connection with the year plan  as compared to an after tax expense of approximately  for the year and  for the year with respect to non centralized systems ie  desktop computers  the company obtained updated software releases and new hardware designed to be yk compliant according to the representations of the vendors 
the installation of such new pc hardware and software was commenced in early and was completed during the fourth quarter of the company also faced the risk that one or more of its external suppliers of goods or services third party providers would not be in a position to properly interact with the company due to the inability of such third party provider to resolve its own yk issues 
during  the company completed an inventory of its third party provider relationships 
in order to assess the yk readiness of such third party providers  the company developed and forwarded a detailed questionnaire to such providers 
as the responses to the questionnaires were received  the company evaluated the overall yk readiness of its third party provider relationships 
the company did not experience any material problems with its third party vendors which were related to the year date change
