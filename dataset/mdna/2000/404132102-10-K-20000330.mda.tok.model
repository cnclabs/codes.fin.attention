general the company s primary sources of revenue are earned premium and investment income derived from its insurance company operations  management fees generated from its underwriting agency operations  commission income produced by its intermediary operations and other operating income 
the company s core underwriting activities involve providing accident and health reinsurance  aviation  marine  offshore energy  property  workers compensation  group health and medical stop loss insurance  marketed directly by the company and produced by independent agents 
the company has substantially increased its shareholders equity through the issuance of equity securities and earnings  thereby enabling it to increase the underwriting capacity of its insurance company subsidiaries 
the company has utilized this additional equity by increasing underwriting activity across many of its core lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in time 
in each line of business  as an insurer  the company also cedes premium through the purchase of reinsurance in types and amounts appropriate to the line of business  market conditions and the company s desired net risk retention profile 
the company s underwriting agency operations underwrite aviation  medical stop loss  occupational accident and workers compensation insurance and and a variety of accident and health related reinsurance products 
the company s intermediary operations also place insurance and reinsurance for the company s insurance company and underwriting agency operations and other non affiliated insurance companies and risk taking entities  as well as on behalf of medium to large corporate clients 
since  the company has focused its acquisition activities on expanding its underwriting agency and intermediary operations for three principal reasons 
the first reason is an attempt to increase the management fees and commission income components of the company s total revenue  which management believes has been a more predictable and stable source of revenue than the potential underwriting profits from insurance company operations 
the second reason is an effort to insulate the company from a decline in its revenue growth rate as insurance premium rates become more competitive in the lines of business in which the company specializes and the company becomes more selective in its underwriting approach  resulting in reduced earned premium 
the third reason is to provide a future source of premium revenue to the company s insurance company subsidiaries and more control of its distribution channels 
operations whose revenue are included in other operating income consist of insurance related service operations which may support the company s operations as well as service unaffiliated customers 
additionally  this revenue includes revenue from strategic operational investments and gains and losses from their disposition 
the company may make such strategic investments from time to time  generally in businesses that complement the company s operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain premium revenue information for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands direct    reinsurance assumed    gross written premium    reinsurance ceded    net written premium    change in unearned premium    net earned premium    the following table sets forth the relationships of certain income statement items as a percent of total revenue for the three years ended december  net earned premium management fees commission income net investment income net realized investment gain loss other operating income total revenue loss and lae net operating expense interest expense earnings before income tax provision income tax provision net earnings includes restructuring expense  provision for reinsurance and merger expense 
year end december  versus year end december  total revenue increased to million in  from million in the revenue increase was principally a result of increases in non risk bearing management fees and commission income 
this growth is from new business and acquisitions 
it is anticipated that revenue from the insurance company subsidiaries will begin to grow in as earned premium and investment income begin to rise as a result of higher retentions and cash flow from increased gross written premium 
net investment income increased to million in from million in  reflecting a slightly higher level of investment assets and increased interest rates earned on short term investments 
during  the company will utilize its available cash flow to reduce its debt but  nevertheless  it is anticipated that net investment income will continue to grow 
net realized investment losses from sales or write downs of equity securities were million in  compared to losses of  in in  the company recognized a million realized loss from the write down of one equity investment to its estimated fair market value based upon market quotations and a sale expectation 
net realized investment losses from disposition of fixed income securities were  in  compared to gains of million in the losses in resulted from the sale of bonds by hc in connection with the funding of the centris acquisition 
compensation expense increased to million in  from million in this increase reflects a normal progressional increase due to business growth as well as the effect of acquisitions 
other operating expenses increased million to million during the same period for similar reasons 
currency conversion gains amounted to  in  compared to gains of  in interest expense was million for  an increase of million from the increase is a result of increased debt outstanding as a result of fundings for acquisitions 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was due to the reduction in earnings before income tax 
the effective tax rates for both years were approximately the same 
the effective tax rate is expected to increase in as a result of increased goodwill amortization which is not deductible for tax purposes  higher state income taxes and foreign taxes for which credit against united states taxes may be limited 
the increased state income taxes result from expected increased income from intermediaries and brokers subject to state income taxes as well as an expected increase in income in states with higher income tax rates 
net earnings in decreased to million from million in  due to the provision for reinsurance  which equated to million after income taxes  or per diluted share  the higher net loss ratio and the restructuring expense  which  after income taxes  amounted to per diluted share 
diluted earnings per share decreased to per share from per share during the same period 
the company s book value per share was as of december   up from as of december  segments insurance companies gwp increased to million in  from million in accident and health reinsurance  medical stop loss and workers compensation premium showed strong growth  as the insurance company subsidiaries continue to participate in more of the business written by underwriting agency subsidiaries 
this growth was partially offset by reductions in property and offshore energy premium as a result of the continuing extremely soft conditions in these markets 
nwp in increased to million from million in  as a result of increases in retained aviation and medical stop loss premium 
net earned premium in decreased slightly to million from million in as changes in earned premium lag behind changes in written premium 
it is anticipated that nwp will rise during  as the insurance company subsidiaries begin to increase retentions as rates start to improve 
loss and lae increased to million in  from million in  and the gaap net loss ratio increased to in  from in the gaap gross loss ratio was in compared to in the deterioration is primarily from poor results in the aviation  property and medical stop loss lines of business 
the company has taken steps to reduce these gross loss ratios  primarily by increasing premium rates and more selective risk selection 
the statutory net combined ratio was excluding the effects of the provision for reinsurance in compared to in during  the company had net loss and lae deficiency of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in during  the company had gross loss and lae deficiency of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency results from the development of large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or reserves were increased as subsequent information became available 
however  as these policies were substantially reinsured  there is no material effect to the company s net earnings 
the deficiencies and redundancies in the net reserves result from the company s and its actuaries continued review of its loss reserves and the increase or reduction of such reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
the company continues to believe it has materially provided for all material net incurred losses 
in  the insurance company subsidiaries recorded a million provision for reinsurance to reflect an estimated million pre tax loss for the insolvency of one of the subsidiaries reinsurers and an estimated million pre tax loss  the majority of which represents the discount on ceded reserves  related to the commutation of all liabilities with another reinsurer 
this commutation  made at the company s request  was finalized and settled in february  in connection with the commutation  the subsidiaries received cash and other amounts totaling million 
additionally  as of december  the company has a reserve of million which management believes is sufficient to absorb any potential losses related to its reinsurance recoverables 
however  the adverse economic environment in the worldwide insurance industry has placed great pressure on reinsurers and the results of their operations and these conditions could  ultimately  affect reinsurers solvency 
historically  there have been insolvencies following a period of competitive pricing in the industry  such as the marketplace has experienced for the last several years 
therefore  while management believes that the reserve is adequate based upon current available information  conditions may change or additional information might be obtained that would affect management s estimate of the adequacy of the level of the reserve and which may result in a future increase or decrease in the reserve 
management continually reviews the company s financial exposure to the reinsurance market and will continue to take actions to protect shareholders equity 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of ceding commissions on reinsurance ceded  decreased million to million in  from million in  reflecting a greater amount of gross premium ceded and  therefore  a higher level of ceding commissions 
net earnings of the insurance companies decreased to a loss of million in  from a profit of million in  as a result of the provision for reinsurance  the effect of restructuring and the higher net loss ratio 
generally  underwriting profitability has deteriorated as the extremely competitive market conditions continue to affect current results 
these results will probably continue to deteriorate even as there is a transition to a harder market but  eventually  should become profitable as rates increase and underwriting becomes more selective 
underwriting agencies management fees increased to million in  from million in premium underwritten on behalf of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies increased to million in  an increase of from million in both increases resulted from acquisitions and internal growth of existing operations 
management fees and premium underwritten are expected to continue to increase in as a result of the centris acquisition and increased premium 
net earnings of the underwriting agencies decreased to million in  from million in recent acquisitions have not yet had a positive impact on net earnings due to licensing and other regulatory requirements  which are in process 
in addition  the underwriting agency segment incurred a million  net of income tax  restructuring expense in growth in underwriting agency premium has a positive impact on both the insurance company segment and the intermediary segment 
intermediaries commission income increased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of rml  effective january  net earnings of the intermediaries decreased to million in from million in the increase in net earnings generated by rml was offset by fewer large brokerage transactions in and other reductions  including a  net of income tax restructuring expense in other operations other operating revenue increased to million in  from million in there was a general increase in revenue of the service operations  net of the decrease in revenue related to operations disposed of in late other operating net earnings increased to million in  from million in due principally to the higher earnings of the service operations 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on activity in the purchase or disposition of strategic investments 
acquisitions in connection with the centris acquisition  a plan was formulated  approved and implemented prior to december  to eliminate centris corporate staff  combine the centris medical stop loss operations with those of hccb and combine certain centris and hccb production and underwriting facilities 
in accordance with the plan  certain centris employees were terminated with severance benefits to be paid in accordance with centris employment contracts for executives or the hcc severance plan for centris employees who did not have employment contracts 
these severance obligations were accrued as of the acquisition date  included in the purchase price allocation and will not be included in expense in the company s statements of earnings 
additionally  accruals of  were made at that date for future lease costs of office space made redundant by the plan 
the following table provides a detailed analysis of the accruals accrued at accrued at purchase december  date paid in contractual executive severance accruals    other severance accruals   lease obligation accruals   total    it is expected that the significant portion of the severance accruals will be paid prior to april   in accordance with the contractual terms of the severance agreements 
management is still evaluating what additional actions  if any  are necessary to finalize the integration of the centris operations 
any additional accruals will be recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation 
restructuring the company recorded a restructuring charge and associated expenses of million during the fourth quarter of since its initial public offering in  the company has completed more than fifteen acquisitions for a total value exceeding million 
during that time  total employees have grown from less than to more than  as a result of this rapid growth  management believes certain operating inefficiencies occurred 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  management made a review of its operations and determined that they could be made more efficient  principally by reducing the employee count in certain of its operations 
management believes that this restructuring will strengthen the company s corporate and management structure and enhance future earnings by improving operating efficiency and therefore profitability 
the savings  principally in compensation expense  from the restructuring is estimated to be approximately million to million in the year and annually thereafter 
the terminations that generated the compensation savings took place in the fourth quarter 
a total of employees were terminated in the fourth quarter as a result of the company s restructuring which affected all segments 
the company accrued severance payments for of these terminated employees at december   substantially all of which was paid in january  the restructuring charge also includes accruals of  related to future lease costs of office space made redundant as a result of the restructuring plan and a write down of  principally of leasehold improvements and other assets related to the redundant space 
the following table provides a detailed analysis of the charge paid in accrued expensed at in severance    other    write down of assets  total restructuring expense  year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue growth resulted from increases in non risk bearing management fees  commission income  and other operating income as a result of internal growth and acquisitions 
the decrease in insurance company net earned premium offsets these increases 
net investment income increased to million in from million in reflecting a slightly higher level of investment assets 
in  the company also utilized a substantial amount of its non insurance company subsidiary cash flow to reduce debt and therefore interest expense  limiting the amount of cash subject to short term investment 
net realized investment losses from sales of equity securities were  in  compared to losses of  in net realized investment gains from disposition of fixed income securities were million in  compared to losses of  in the gains in resulted principally from the sale of bonds upon the liquidation of a subsidiary 
compensation expense increased million or in to million due to the increase in personnel resulting from acquisitions completed during  along with an increase in management personnel hired to oversee the integration of the company s many acquisitions 
other operating expense increased to million in these expenses reflect increased expenditures required to meet the overall growth in business and from acquisitions 
currency conversion gains amounted to  in  compared to losses of  in merger expense represents non recurring items incurred to consummate the acquisitions and mergers which are accounted for as pooling of interests 
income tax expense was million in  compared to million in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in as net income from the underwriting agency and intermediary operations grow  the company s effective tax rate increases due to state income taxes and the mitigation of the effect of tax exempt municipal bond income on the combined effective tax rate 
net earnings increased to million in  from million in diluted earnings per share increased to in from in segments insurance companies gwp increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased aviation  property  medical stop loss and accident and health reinsurance premium 
nwp for decreased to million from million in  due to an increase in the amount of ceded reinsurance 
net earned premium decreased to million in compared to million in reflecting the reduction in nwp and the reduced retentions of the company 
operating earnings for were impacted by hurricanes georges and mitch 
the gross loss from these hurricanes amounted to more than million before reinsurance  with georges being the largest catastrophe loss ever incurred by the company 
the net retained loss after reinsurance and taxes was million  or per share 
this catastrophe further demonstrates how the company s conservative reinsurance philosophy protects shareholders equity and limits the impact of a major catastrophe loss 
aic  acquired in june   recorded a million increase in loss and lae reserves during december   predominantly relating to and claims incurred prior to the company s acquisition of aic 
this increase in reserves was made to bring aic s reserving practices consistent with the more conservative method used by the company s other insurance company operations 
management expects the increase in aic s loss reserves to be adequate to cover any subsequent adverse development of aic s prior losses 
loss and lae decreased million in  to million  reflecting the increased use of reinsurance  despite the catastrophe loss in from the hurricanes georges and mitch 
excluding the effect of the catastrophe loss in and aic s reserve strengthening in  loss and lae decreased  and the company s gaap loss ratio increased to in from in including these effects  the company s gaap loss ratio increased to for from in both increases reflect the higher incurred losses and lae on substantially lower earned premium in when compared to additionally  the increased loss ratios reflect a general deterioration in pricing in coupled with a higher frequency of attritional losses 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries statutory combined ratio was for compared to for during  the company had net loss and lae redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in during  the company had gross loss and lae deficiency of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency results from the development of several large claims on individual policies which were either reported late or reserves were increased as subsequent information became available 
however  as these policies were substantially reinsured  there is no material effect to the company s net earnings 
the redundancies in the net reserves result from the company s and its actuaries continued review of its loss reserves and the reduction of such reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of ceding commissions on reinsurance ceded  decreased million to million in  from million in  reflecting a greater amount of gross premium ceded and  therefore  a higher level of ceding commissions 
net earnings of the insurance companies decreased to million in from million in  as a result of a general deterioration in underwriting results 
underwriting agencies management fees in increased to million from million in premium underwritten on behalf of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies increased to million in  an increase of from million in both increases resulted from acquisitions and internal growth 
net earnings of the underwriting agencies increased to million in from million in due to acquisitions and internal growth 
intermediaries commission income increased to million in from million in an increase of 
net earnings of the intermediaries increased to million in from million in the increases result from internal growth and a number of large brokerage transactions 
other operations other operating income increased to million in  from million in  principally as a result of a million pre tax gain on the sale of one of the company s subsidiaries whose operations were not material to those of the company 
additionally  revenue of a service company subsidiary increased million in net earnings from other operations increased for the same reasons 
liquidity and capital resources the company receives substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  and management fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investment assets 
the principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and lae  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service  policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
as of december   several of the company s subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through december  advances under the lines of credit are primarily used to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  
at december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries  with total securities collateralizing the line of million 
on december   the company entered into a loan agreement the facility with a group of banks 
the facility includes a million revolving loan facility 
borrowing under the facility may be made from time to time by the company for general corporate purposes until the facility s expiration on december  outstanding advances under the facility bear interest at agreed upon rates 
the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of the stock of hc  hccl  aic and ussic and by the pledge of stock and guarantees entered into by the company s principal underwriting agency and intermediary subsidiaries 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  including  without limitation  minimum net worth requirements for the company and certain subsidiaries  restrictions on certain extraordinary corporate actions  notice requirements for certain material occurrences  and required maintenance of specified financial ratios 
management believes that the restrictive covenants and other obligations of the company which are contained in the facility agreement are typical for financing arrangements comparable to the facility 
the initial funding available under the facility was used  among other things  to refinance existing indebtedness of the company including all outstanding indebtedness under the company s million revolving credit facility and million short term revolving loan facility entered into as of march  which has been terminated  and to partially fund the centris acquisition 
as of december   total debt outstanding under the facility was million 
unrelated to the facility  in december   the company entered into an million bridge loan with a bank in connection with the centris acquisition 
the full amount of the bridge loan was repaid prior to december   immediately following the centris acquisition 
the company maintains a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
as of december   the company had cash and short term investments of approximately million 
the company s consolidated investment portfolio of million as of december   of which million is short term investments  is available to provide additional liquidity 
property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any month period  without the prior written consent of the commissioner of insurance  to the greater of statutory net income or of statutory policyholders surplus 
hc and ussic paid no dividends in during  hc and ussic s ordinary dividend capacity is approximately million and million  respectively 
under the laws of the state of maryland  aic may only pay dividends out of statutory earned surplus 
the maximum amount of dividends that aic may pay without prior regulatory approval in any month period is the greater of its statutory net income under certain conditions or of its statutory policyholders surplus 
because aic paid an extraordinary dividend of million during december   any dividends paid by aic during will need prior regulatory approval 
no dividends from aic are anticipated during hccl is limited by the state of indiana in the amount of dividends it may pay in any twelve month period  without prior regulatory approval  to the greater of net gain from operations for the prior calendar year or ten percent of statutory capital and surplus as of the prior year end 
during  hccl s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  short term investments and the facility will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to meet its anticipated needs for the foreseeable future 
the value of the company s portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some of the company s fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject the company to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and the company reinvests the proceeds at lower interest rates 
the company mitigates this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
as of december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million compared to million as of december  due to the company s history of consistent earnings and expectations for the future  it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset 
the overall increase in activities at the insurance company subsidiaries and the acquisition of centris in late december  resulted in increases in gross loss reserves  life and annuity policy benefits  gross unearned premiums and deferred policy acquisition costs since related amounts of reinsurance recoverables  ceded life and policy benefits  ceded unearned premium and deferred ceding commissions also increased 
the company continues to collect its receivables and recoverables generally in the ordinary course of business and has not incurred and does not expect to incur any significant liquidity difficulties as a result of the substantial growth in gross amounts due 
the company limits its liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit or other security such that net balances due to it are significantly less than the gross balances shown in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   each of the domestic insurance company subsidiaries total adjusted capital is significantly in excess of the naic authorized control level risk based capital 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gwp should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and nwp should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
the company s property and casualty insurance company subsidiaries maintain a premium to surplus ratio significantly lower than such guidelines  generally well below industry norms and for the year ended december   their annual statutory gwp was of their statutory policyholders surplus and their nwp was of their statutory policyholders surplus 
impact of inflation the company s operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and lae are known 
although management considers the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not adequately compensate the company for the effects of inflation 
however  as the majority of the company s business is comprised of lines which have short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to the company and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products which are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of medical costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
no express provision for inflation is made  although trends are considered when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves 
claim reserves are subject to a continuing review process to assess their adequacy and are adjusted as deemed appropriate 
in addition  the market value of the investments held by the company varies depending on economic and market conditions and interest rates  which are highly sensitive to the policies of governmental and regulatory authorities 
any significant increase in interest rates could therefore have a material adverse effect on the market value of the company s investments 
in addition  the company s million facility s interest rate floats with that of the market 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on earnings 
exchange rate fluctuations the company underwrites risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
it establishes and maintains loss reserves with respect to these policies in their respective currencies 
these reserves are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which can have an effect on the company s net earnings 
the company s principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the major european currencies and the united states dollar 
for the years ended december   and  the gain loss from currency conversion was   and  respectively 
on a very limited basis in the past  the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
rml  purchased by the company during january   has a revenue stream in us dollars but incurs expenses in gbp 
to mitigate the foreign exchange risk  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times through december as of december   the company had forward contracts to sell us million for gbp at an average rate of gbp equals us 
the foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount which approximates average monthly expenses 
thus  the effect of these transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly expenses 
in the future  the company may continue to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than a form of speculative or trading investment 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued in june  and is now effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company has utilized derivatives or hedging strategies only infrequently in the past and in immaterial amounts  although it is currently using derivatives and hedging strategies to a greater extent as it expands its foreign operations 
the effects of sfas no 
 as well as the timing of its adoption  are currently being reviewed by management 
during december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
entitled revenue recognition in financial statements which becomes effective for the company during the second quarter of the company does not expect the adoption of sab no 
to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or shareholders equity 
year the year issue is the result of date coding within computer programs that were written using just two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  these date codes could cause computers to fail to calculate dates beyond and  as a result  computer applications could fail or create erroneous information as a result of the year date change 
the company s expenditures in connection with the year issues associated with its own systems did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
no additional costs are anticipated 
although the company experienced no material system failures attributed to the year changeover  the company may have exposure in the property and casualty operations of its insurance company subsidiaries to claims asserted under certain insurance policies for damages caused by an insured s failure to address its own year computer problems 
as with other companies in the insurance industry  the company has evaluated and continues to evaluate the potential year insurance exposures 
the company s insurance company subsidiaries did not generally offer policies of insurance marketed as year liability coverage 
however  due to the nature of certain of the policies  such as policies of property insurance  insureds may submit purported claims for coverage under such policies which may result from year related causes 
in this regard  the company continues to assess appropriate responses to such attempted claims in light of year coverage issues under the insurance coverages offered by such subsidiaries 
the nature of the company s response to such attempted claims are generally dependent on the particular facts and circumstances of the underlying claims and coverage 
management does not believe that year coverage issues associated with the insurance coverages offered by the company s insurance company subsidiaries will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became their common legal currency on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies will continue to serve as legal tender and denominations of the euro between january  and january  the conversion to the euro is scheduled to be completed on july   when the national currencies will cease to exist 
the company does not expect the introduction of the euro to have a material effect on the company s business  software plans  financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable equity securities  credit risk on its reinsurance recoverables and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage its exposures of investment risks  the company generally invests in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of its insurance liabilities 
the company has not used derivatives to manage any of its investment related market risks 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  not all factors and balances are taken into account  and assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate 
interest rate risk the value of the company s portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of the company s fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject the company to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and the company reinvests the proceeds at lower interest rates 
the company mitigates this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of the company s fixed income securities as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to change  the fair value of the company s fixed income securities would change approximately million as of december  this compares to change in value of million as of december  for the same change in interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
the facility entered into by the company is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  the company s interest expense is directly correlated to market interest rates 
as of december   the company had million in debt outstanding under the facility 
at this debt level  a change in market interest rates would change the company s annual interest expense by million 
as of december   the company had million in debt outstanding under its previous facility 
at that debt level  the change in market interest rates would have changed interest expense by million 
equity risk the company s portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price risk due to market changes 
the fair value of the company s marketable equity securities including those designated as strategic operational investments  if any as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  if the market price of all marketable equity securities were to change by as of these dates  the fair value of the company s equity portfolio would have changed million as of december  and million as of december  credit risk see reinsurance ceded section contained in item  business  and footnote in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk the company underwrites risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
it establishes and maintains loss reserves with respect to these policies in their respective currencies  as well as having varying receivable and payable balances at any point in time 
these amounts are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which can have an effect on the company s net earnings 
the company s principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the major european currencies and the united states dollar 
the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times hypothetical hypothetical us dollar change in us dollar change in equivalent fair value equivalent fair value british pound sterling     euro and national currencies     on a historical basis  the eleven national currencies which are now in the process of being converted to the euro have not always had their relative exchange rates change together 
however  with the fixing of exchange rates on january  relative to the new euro  these currencies will now behave as one currency 
on a very limited basis in the past  the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
rml  purchased by the company during january   has a revenue stream in us dollars but incurs expenses in gbp 
to mitigate the foreign exchange risk  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times through december  as of december   the company had forward contracts to sell us million for gbp at an average rate of gbp equals us 
the foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount which approximates average monthly expenses 
thus  the effect of these transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly expenses 
in the future  the company may continue to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the company utilizes these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than as a form of speculative or trading investment
