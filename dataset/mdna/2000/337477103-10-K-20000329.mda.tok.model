excluding these items  recurring earnings per share rose in to per diluted share  compared to in  and represented a return on average assets and a return on average equity 
first virginia maintained its position as one of the strongest and most well capitalized banks in the country 
at the end of  the corporation s equity to asset ratio had improved further to compared to at the end of this strong capital position permitted the corporation to increase its dividend twice during the year to its current annualized rate of per share 
in addition  the corporation purchased  shares during since the end of  the corporation has returned million to shareholders in dividends and million through share repurchases and has still increased its total capital by million 
the corporation s philosophy of safety  profitability and growth  in that order  places a high importance on maintaining a strong capital position and excellent asset quality 
asset quality continued to improve during from figures that were already much better than industry averages 
net loan charge offs were half the rate of the prior year and equaled 
of average loans compared to 
in and 
in nonperforming assets declined to million  representing a record low 
of outstanding loans 
this compares to the million and 
of loans at december  and 
of loans at december  loans past due days or more also declined significantly to million  a drop compared to the prior year s million 
as a result of the sale of the credit card portfolio  which had the highest charge off rate of any of the corporation s loan portfolios  and the improvement in asset quality and net charge offs generally  the allowance for loan losses was reduced and represented of total loans as compared to at the end of and average loans grew during to billion  following another gain in the growth in was more impressive  however  considering the sale of the credit card loan portfolio in late and early and the intentional slowdown in loan growth at the end of as the corporation bolstered its liquidity in preparation for any potential yk related deposit withdrawals by customers 
the corporation s premier automobile finance operations set a record for new loan production  and average outstanding loans rose in this area in  following a increase in and in two new offices and state of the art delivery systems all contributed to increased sales in this area  and even more significantly  the corporation ranked at the top of the jd powers dealer satisfaction survey  which asked automobile dealers about their financial services providers 
deposit growth was slower in than in prior years  reflecting a long term gradual shift in consumer preferences for their savings 
during  average deposits increased to billion compared to a growth rate in to billion from billion in most of the growth that did occur in was in the low cost transaction account categories  with both demand deposits and interest checking deposits rising 
this growth is primarily attributable to the corporation s community focus  high quality service and extensive branch network 
for the nd consecutive year  the net interest margin once again exceeded  placing first virginia third highest among the largest banks in the country

statement of income net interest income the table on pages through details the increase in earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and demand deposits for the last three years  along with the related levels of fully taxable equivalent interest income and expense 
the variance in interest income and expense caused by differences in average balances and rates is shown on pages and the prosperous national economy continued to surge at s year end  setting a record as the longest period of economic expansion in the nation s history 
also marked a recovery in the international markets 
they all showed sustained growth following the asian and russian crises  which precipitated a worldwide crisis 
as a result  the federal reserve moved in late to stabilize the monetary markets and lowered interest rates in three successive drops 
however  with the surging national and international economies in  the federal reserve moved to a more restrictive stance and increased rates three times in similar increments 
the threat of higher rates and possible federal reserve actions had the impact of increasing interest rates throughout  raising bond yields over and effectively eliminating the real estate loan refinance market 
first virginia maintains a very liquid portfolio of both assets and liabilities and attempts to mitigate the risk inherent in changing rates in this manner 
due to the nature of its deposit base  however  first virginia will generally perform better in periods of higher interest rates than lower rates 
during  the net interest margin declined five basis points to compared to in and in however  most of this drop in the margin occurred early in the year when rates were still low from the interest rate declines in with the rising interest rates  first virginia saw a steady expansion in its net interest margin as lower yielding assets were replaced with higher yielding loans 
first virginia relies almost entirely on its branch network to supply it with a relatively low cost source of funds  and it has no purchased funds and does not need to hedge its position with derivative securities of any kind 
this has produced one of the highest net interest margins among the country s largest banks on a consistent basis 
was the nd consecutive year that first virginia had a net interest margin of at least 
net interest margin the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group southern regionals banking companies with assets over billion in national peer group banking companies with assets of between and billion in source keefe  bruyette woods the yield on earning assets declined basis points in  primarily the result of a decrease in the yield on loans of basis points to 
in  deposits grew at a faster rate than they could be employed in loans  resulting in an unwanted short term buildup in liquidity  particularly in lower yielding money market investments and securities 
in  however  loan demand was strong  most notably for automobile loans  while deposit growth was weaker 
this resulted in a shift of earning assets out of short term money market investments and into loans and investment securities 
the demand for high quality  automobile loans was strong in  and yields in this category were only slightly less than historic spreads  thus contributing to the decline in the net interest margin 
the spreads on commercial loans and real estate loans also declined more than interest rates in general as banks and other financial services providers attempted to sustain the volumes of the past several years 
in the last half of the year  the corporation allowed all of its maturing investment securities to be reallocated to either loans or general liquidity to have sufficient funds for potential yk related customer withdrawals 
this had a negative impact on the net interest margin in the fourth quarter 
after remaining unchanged for three years  the cost of funds declined at an even greater pace in  dropping basis points to 
interest checking rates dropped basis points to 
and continued to drop at year end  despite the overall increase in interest rates 
in contrast  certificates of deposit rates dropped only basis points to and were accelerating rapidly at year end  pointing to increased rate competition in early average money market accounts increased in  following a increase in when the corporation initiated a program to increase the proportion of deposit dollars coming from this relatively lower cost source of funds 
an increase in the interest rate in this category  relative to other deposit categories  was responsible for a basis point increase in the cost of these accounts in  although they declined in cost by basis points in consumers still prefer shorter term categories of deposits  preferring the flexibility that these instruments provide in contrast to the higher yields they can receive by extending the term of their savings instruments 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses declined in  despite a increase in outstanding loans 
the total provision in was million compared to million in and million in the decline in can be directly related to a decline in net charge offs of million as asset quality improved in all lines of the corporation s business 
during the first quarter of  the corporation sold the remaining portion of its credit card loan portfolio  which accounted for the single largest dollar amount and percentage of loan charge offs in and virtually all other categories of loans had reductions in net charge offs in  reflecting the overall improvement in asset quality and the strength of the economy 
in  the net charge off ratio was cut in half to 
of average loans compared to 
in and 
in it has averaged 
over the past five years 
the corporation has a lower risk exposure to charge offs than many banks because most of its loans are made in small amounts to consumers and are generally well secured by assets such as automobiles or real estate 
these loans also have regular monthly repayment schedules  and their average duration is substantially less than their stated lives 
the balance of the corporation s loans are made primarily to small and medium sized businesses in the corporation s trade area and are well secured 
the corporation does not have any international  national or highly leveraged credits  nor does it have any concentration of credit in any one industry that exposes the loan portfolio to adverse risk 
while approximately of the corporation s loan portfolio is comprised of automobile sector loans  the loans are for relatively small amounts to consumers and have regular monthly payment schedules and are of the highest quality so that the risk of exposure is very limited 
the corporation has avoided the subprime segment of both the automobile and home equity loan markets 
noninterest income noninterest income increased in to million compared to a increase in to million 
first virginia increased the proportion of income received from noninterest sources to in and to in compared to a more historic range of 
this is in line with the corporation s objective of increasing the share of income from noninterest sources to reduce its traditional dependence on the net interest margin 
income from service charges on deposits is the single largest component of noninterest income  and it increased in following an increase in the increase in service charge income was primarily attributable to a increase in transaction accounts 
the increase  in contrast  was more the result of a change in assessing service charges on deposit accounts  the result of the corporation s move to value based pricing late in in addition  the corporation has been actively pursuing multi location national accounts such as food stores  convenience stores and fast food operators in its marketplace 
income from electronic banking services  primarily atm and debit card fees  slowed during  following several years of significant growth 
fees from this category declined in after rising in  in and in this rapid growth occurred when the corporation took advantage of its atm network and assessed noncustomers a fee for the convenience of using the corporation s machines 
this activity slowed in  as consumers began to modify their behavior  making fewer but larger transactions from atms and utilizing their own service provider s machines first 
it is not anticipated that this category will show significant growth in  although debit card activity is expected to increase dramatically in mid as the corporation introduces its own debit card 
insurance income also slowed during with income increasing following an increase of in with high interest rates causing a decline in home sales  commissions for title insurance declined slightly following several years of double digit growth 
also  in response to national concerns over privacy issues  the corporation slowed down its direct mail marketing to customers of its banking and nonbank subsidiaries 
sales of annuity products more than tripled as the corporation s insurance company increased the number of agents selling insurance and brokerage services 
credit life insurance sales continued their slow decline as lower rates and lower loan volumes made their impact 
income from trust services continued its strong growth record  rising in following increases of in  in and in with more emphasis on new sales  larger account balances and more commercial trust services  the margin in this line has improved significantly over the last several years 
the corporation determined that its credit card activities no longer met its strategic objectives and desired returns 
as a result  it sold the remainder of its credit card loan portfolio and merchant processing business to companies with national concerns that can provide a better value for its customers and greater income to first virginia 
in the fourth quarter of  a portion of the credit card portfolio was sold at a gain of million  and the balance of the portfolio and the merchant business was sold in at a gain of million 
ongoing income from credit card activities was almost eliminated by the end of the second quarter of  and gross income from this area declined to million in and will virtually disappear in other income in included a gain of million from the sale of seven offices in maryland 
in  other income included a gain of million from the sale of three branches in southwest virginia that were required to be divested as part of the acquisition of premier bankshares corporation 
in prior years  the corporation regularly made a sale of mortgage servicing rights and realized gains of million in both and in late  the servicing activities of the corporation s mortgage loan subsidiary were largely eliminated and mortgage loans are now originated and sold with servicing released so that no significant gains have been recorded in or the corporation recognized gains of 
million in and million in from the sale of equity securities 
the corporation s policy is to hold virtually all of its fixed income securities to maturity and  accordingly  there were no security sales producing gains or losses in  with the exception of some bonds called by the issuer prior to the maturity date 
noninterest expense the growth in noninterest expenses slowed dramatically in to under following increases of in and in the growth in noninterest expenses in was related to the acquisition of branches on maryland s eastern shore and in to the acquisition of premier bankshares  accounted for as a purchase 
however  excluding the impact of the acquisition related expenses  noninterest expense in and would have been up less than in each year 
the efficiency ratio improved slightly in  dropping to from in and in efficiency ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group salaries and employee benefits increased in due to lower health care costs and to a reduction in stock related compensation benefits to 
million after peaking in at million 
in  salaries and employee benefits rose  and in they rose  due in part to the additional branch offices purchased in and the premier acquisition in pension plan expense decreased in as the investment yield on the fund s assets have substantially outperformed underlying assumptions for several years 
in  pension expense increased after falling in  a result of required changes in the discount rate assumption used to calculate future benefit liabilities 
equipment expense rose in following increases of in and in the corporation has updated many of its systems over the past several years in preparation for the yk turnover  significantly increasing its capabilities in customer delivery and service 
as of december   million has been incurred since the inception of year projects  future expenditures are expected to be nominal 
the changeover to year was successfully completed with no significant customer service issues 
we will continue to monitor all business processes throughout to address any issues that might arise and ensure that all processes continue to operate successfully 
we will also monitor customers  vendors and other third parties for year related issues 
the growth in amortization of intangibles expense slowed during to 
million for a total of million following increases of million in and million in the increases in and were due primarily to the acquisition of branch offices from competitors and the payment of a deposit intangible 
in addition  the premier acquisition caused intangibles amortization expense to increase in and since  first virginia has accounted for all of its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all other noninterest expenses declined in following increases of in and in  a result of the inclusion of premier in both years 
advertising expenses declined to a more normal level  following a increase in the prior year when the corporation increased advertising expenditures to capitalize on the consolidations and mergers in its markets and attract new customers 
legal and professional fees increased million following a million increase in due to the use of outside consultants for some year conversion work and fees related to the corporation s new approach to service charges on deposit accounts 
this expense should decline significantly in with the completion of these projects 
credit card expenses declined million in with the sale of the credit card portfolio and should drop an additional million in telecommunication expenses declined as the corporation achieved certain efficiencies in its telephone network  following a rise in when capabilities were increased substantially 
provision for income taxes income tax expense in increased million to million  primarily as a consequence of an increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate declined in to after remaining steady at in both and the decline in the effective tax rate was caused by an increase in the proportion of the corporation s investment portfolio held in tax exempt securities 
prior to  the corporation had steadily decreased its investment in tax exempt securities because of changes in tax laws enacted in the s that made them a relatively less attractive form of investment than other securities 
in late  an international crisis in the securities markets placed a greater value on safety over yield  causing municipal securities to become slightly more attractive to the corporation than us treasury securities 
as a consequence  the corporation almost doubled the amount of funds invested in tax exempt securities in  which resulted in the reduction in the corporation s effective tax rate 
with the return of the bond markets to a more traditional yield relationship  it is anticipated that the corporation will return to its long term trend of gradually reducing tax exempt securities as a percentage of its investment portfolio and that the effective tax rate will gradually rise 
balance sheet first virginia s lending portfolio is its primary earning asset  generating approximately of the corporation s gross income 
nearly all earning assets are funded from deposits originated through the corporation s network of branch offices or from capital 
other sources of funding include customer repurchase agreements and commercial paper originated from business customers who utilize the corporation s cash management products  which are functionally equivalent to deposits 
the corporation does not fund any of its earning assets from purchased deposits or other nondeposit funding sources  nor does it sell or securitize any of its earning assets 
the corporation s objective is to invest of its total deposits and short term borrowings in loans 
in  the loan to funding liabilities rate was  an increase from the funding rate achieved in this increase was due to a rate of growth for loans compared to a increase in funding liabilities 
the table below shows the average balances of the various categories of earning assets as a percentage of total earning assets for the years indicated 
loans securities money market investments 
loans held for sale 




other earning assets 




total loans even though average loans increased by during both and  internal loan growth was much stronger in the corporation made the strategic decision to exit the credit card lending business  and in late and again in the first quarter of  it sold portions of its credit card loan portfolio 
by the end of the first quarter of  the corporation had sold its entire portfolio of credit card loans  which reduced average loans by million in excluding the impact of this sale  average loans would have been up in the growth in loans was also impacted by the acquisition of premier bankshares in  which was accounted for as a purchase 
excluding the impact of this acquisition  average loans would have increased only in the largest component of first virginia s loan portfolio is automobile related loans  particularly loans originated through automobile dealerships 
the corporation is a full service provider to the automobile dealership community and makes loans to consumers to finance their purchase of automobiles  loans to dealers to finance their inventory of automobiles and  to a lesser extent  their facilities 
as the corporation has exploited this expertise over the past five years  the percentage of loans that are automobile related increased from of the loan portfolio at the end of  to at the end of outstanding automobile loans to consumers originated through dealers increased at the end of compared to and were up in compared to over the past several years  the corporation consolidated all of its dealer automobile origination activities into a separate company  which will enhance its service capabilities and take advantage of new technology 
as a consequence  new loan production increased in and in compared to a increase in the corporation opened two new sales offices in in pittsburgh and atlanta as part of its strategy to gradually expand its market  primarily in the southeastern and mid atlantic regions 
first virginia concentrates on the highest quality automobile loans  primarily a and b credits 
most of these loans are made to consumers and are secured by new cars with a maximum term of five years 
the loan portfolio s high quality means net charge offs are significantly below industry averages and servicing and funding costs are among the lowest in the industry  giving the corporation a competitive advantage over less efficient producers 
first virginia uses an experienced loan reviewer in underwriting each loan in these local loan production offices and does not rely on credit scoring models 
this allows the corporation to give highly personal service and quick approval to the dealer originating the loan 
once made  the loans are serviced centrally to insure consistency and quality of collection at the lowest cost 
the corporation also makes loans directly to dealers to finance their sales inventory floor plan loans  which are fully secured by specific automobiles 
average floor plan loans rose in as dealers increased inventories to take advantage of one of the strongest new car sales years in recent history 
this followed several years of declining floor plan loan balances as dealers aggressively managed their inventories to reduce the inventories on their lots 
the corporation also offers dealers a leasing product and subprime loan alternatives through unaffiliated partners who bear the entire risk for these transactions 
the corporation acts as an agent for these partners and receives a fee in return for its origination activity 
income from these sources was immaterial in and but is part of the corporation s total service approach to the dealer community 
first virginia is committed to being a full financial service provider to the automobile market  regardless of swings in the economic cycle  and it devotes its primary lending resources to this area 
home equity loans are the second largest component of the corporation s lending portfolio  comprising approximately of outstanding loans at the end of these loans have declined steadily over the last several years with the exception of when the premier bankshares acquisition caused a increase 
in  they declined an average of  as strong home sales and refinance activity in and early induced consumers to pay off and consolidate both their existing higher cost home equity loans and other consumer credit debts into new first mortgage loans at cheaper rates 
by mid  however  this refinance activity had slowed considerably as interest rates began to increase  making refinancing a less desirable alternative 
first virginia pursues the highest quality home equity loans with low loan to value ratios that enable the corporation to show a nominal net charge off rate 
these loans are originated through the corporation s branch network 
residential real estate loans are the next largest component of the loan portfolio and comprise approximately of total loans 
this category rose a modest in after a increase in the increase in was a result of the corporation s decision to increase its year  fixed rate real estate loans that have many of the characteristics of a home equity loan 
the corporation s real estate loan portfolio has not been as subject to early prepayment as some banks portfolios because it limits itself primarily to year  fixed rate loans 
these loans do not contain the same prepayment risk as adjustable rate mortgages or mortgages with longer contractual lives that are likely to be refinanced when interest rates decline 
average commercial loans increased in and after advancing in although loan activity was strong in this area  paydowns on existing loans were also heavy both years as a healthy economy and strong earnings reduced the financing requirements of the corporation s commercial customers 
with the strong demand for high quality credits  some borrowers refinanced their commercial loans with competitors 
the increase in outstanding loans in was a direct result of the acquisition of premier bankshares  which had a greater percentage of its loan portfolio in this area 
the corporation makes its loans to small and medium sized businesses in the communities served by its affiliate banks  including loans to government contractors  high tech companies  hospitals  churches and country clubs 
these loans are typically in amounts between to million  generally with a maximum amount of million 
with the significant increase in commercial property construction in recent years  average construction and land development loans increased in following a nominal rise in the corporation makes construction loans primarily for residential development projects or commercial office space that is built for use  and it does not lend for speculative unleased properties 
this type of loan comprised only of outstanding loans at the end of average commercial real estate loans increased in  following a increase in and increase in the corporation s commercial real estate loans are mostly made for owner use properties  generally carrying floating or adjustable interest rates 
loans december in thousands consumer automobile      home equity  fixed and variable rate      revolving credit loans  including credit cards      other      real estate construction and land development      commercial mortgage 
     residential mortgage  excluding loans held for sale      other      commercial      loans  net of unearned income      investment securities the corporation has classified virtually all of its investment portfolio as held to maturity because it has both the ability and the intention to hold these securities to their stated maturity 
approximately of the portfolio is classified as available for sale  either to provide additional liquidity in certain circumstances or because the special nature of the securities requires that they be classified as available for sale 
the corporation has constructed its portfolio in a laddered approach so an approximately equal amount matures each month 
this supplies liquidity to fund loan growth and provides for a natural hedge against changes in interest rates 
the corporation generally does not invest in mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  structured notes or other types of derivative securities 
average outstanding investment securities increased in following a increase in most of this growth occurred in and early when deposit growth was stronger than the growth in loans 
during the second quarter of  loan growth accelerated  and from june forward only minimal reinvestment occurred in the portfolio as maturing securities were used to fund loan growth and to provide liquidity for potential yk related deposit withdrawals 
in  average securities declined as a result of the need to fund loan growth and the acquisition of premier bankshares 
the corporation places primary importance on safety and liquidity in its investment portfolio 
accordingly  the majority of the portfolio is invested in us government and agency securities with maximum lives of approximately five years 
at the end of  the month average term of these securities was unchanged from the end of because of the callable nature of some of these securities  the actual duration of the portfolio may be slightly less than months 
at december   us government and agency securities comprised of the securities portfolio compared to at the end of in the last two years  a greater percentage of new securities has been placed in tax exempt municipal securities  reversing a trend begun in when changes in federal income tax laws reduced the tax benefits derived by banks for investing in them 
in  the collapse of russian and some asian bond markets precipitated a flight to high quality us treasury securities  which decreased the relative yield of these securities compared to municipal securities 
as a result  the corporation was able to purchase more high quality municipal securities at a spread over us treasury securities that met the corporation s investment criteria 
money market investments money market investments  consisting primarily of federal funds sold and securities repurchase agreements  are generally governed by the size of normally anticipated deposit swings and loan demand 
in  average money market investments declined to million as these funds were employed to fund strong loan growth 
in and  these investments increased and  respectively  as a decline in interest rates and a flat to inverted yield curve made these investments relatively more attractive 
deposits average deposits rose million or in with the majority of growth occurring in the relatively lower cost transaction account categories 
interest rates rose slightly throughout the year as the federal reserve reversed the three rate decreases in the second half of and increased rates by a comparable amount in despite the rising interest rate background  the cost of funds declined steadily throughout the year as maturing savings instruments were renewed at lower rates than paid on the original instruments 
by year end  however  the cost of funds began to increase  particularly for certificates of deposit 
the corporation offers a variety of accounts that appeal to different target groups 
the firstvantage plus account  which offers an attractive array of features to the high balance customer  was enhanced in and grew substantially in both and other accounts  appealing more to the typical mid balance customer  provide relationship linkages that avoid service charges 
the corporation s extensive branch office network creates a strong retail focus  resulting in a higher percentage of customers maintaining balances in transaction accounts compared to other banks 
in  of the corporation s average deposits were comprised of demand and interest checking accounts  up slightly from the these accounts comprised of total deposits 
average deposits millions of dollars noninterest bearing    interest checking    money market savings    consumer cds    large denomination cds average demand deposits and interest checking accounts rose  an increase that may be attributable to the convenience and service afforded by the corporation s many branch locations 
average money market accounts rose to million in  after rising in as a result of the corporation s successful efforts to increase this category with premium rates slightly higher than competing banks 
after remaining basically unchanged in  consumer savings accounts declined slightly by during  and have been stable to slightly declining for the past five years 
competition for certificates of deposit increased steadily in as interest rates increased and  as a consequence  average outstanding certificates declined to billion following the increase in as a result of the acquisition of branches in maryland s and virginia s eastern shore area 
by year end  as rising interest rates for consumer certificates of deposit made them more attractive to consumers  the corporation witnessed some growth in this deposit category late in the fourth quarter 
prior to that  the strength of the stock market and the growth in mutual funds had reduced some of the attractiveness of certificates of deposit as investment vehicles 
large denomination certificates of deposit increased during after rising in most of these funds come from the corporation s core consumer customers and pay interest at the same rate as other consumer certificates of deposit 
state and political  and negotiated rate jumbo certificates  which are traditionally considered to be a more volatile and costly source of funds  were relatively unchanged over the last three years and comprise only of total average deposits 
most of the purchasers of these certificates maintain other deposit or lending relationships with the corporation

these short term obligations are issued principally as a convenience to commercial customers in connection with the corporation s cash management services 
average short term borrowings from these sources increased in  in and in  reflecting the increase in the number of commercial customers taking advantage of the corporation s sophisticated cash management services

in  the capital to assets ratio had declined basis points to as a result of greater growth in assets  increased dividends to shareholders  and an active share repurchase program 
these ratios are significantly higher than the capital to assets ratio maintained by banks in the corporation s peer group of to billion asset sized banks 
total capital increased in to billion  however  book value per share increased at a slightly faster rate of to aided by the corporation s share repurchase program that reduced the total number of shares outstanding by

since  several plans to repurchase the corporation s common stock have been approved  and the corporation has purchased an average of million shares per year 
the corporation has repurchased approximately of its shares at a total cost of million  and over the same period  it still increased capital by million 
in the course of its repurchase programs  the corporation has employed the use of equity put warrants and accelerated share repurchase contracts 
first virginia and its affiliate banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
because of the high level of capital and the conservative nature of its assets  the corporation exceeded the additional regulatory risk based capital requirements by wide margins 
the tier risk based capital ratio increased basis points to while the total risk based capital ratio rose basis points to 
the increases followed two years of declines in the ratios caused by growth in total assets  a slight decline in capital and a shift in assets out of the investment portfolio and into higher risk rated loans 
the leverage ratio increased basis points to compared to at the end of each of the corporation s individual banks maintains capital ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and all qualify as well capitalized banks  allowing them the lowest fdic premium rate and freedom to operate without restrictions from regulatory bodies 
asset quality the corporation has a number of policies  reviewed regularly by senior management  to ensure that the risk in lending and investment activities is minimal  while the profit is consistent with the exposure to risk 
each affiliate bank s internal loan monitoring system also provides a detailed monthly report of production  delinquencies  and nonperforming and potential problem loans 
this careful monitoring has resulted in a consistent record of low delinquencies and charge offs  as well as few nonperforming loans in relation to the entire loan portfolio 
the corporation has no foreign or highly leveraged transaction loans  and loans are only made within the trade areas of the affiliated banks or in adjacent states where the corporation maintains loan production offices generating high quality consumer installment loans 
loans are generally not participated with nor purchased from banks outside of the first virginia affiliated group 
in addition  participations between banks within the first virginia group must first be shared with the corporation s lead bank  where a second comprehensive loan review process is performed 
approximately of the corporation s loans are made to consumers and are normally secured by personal or real property 
first virginia has no significant concentrations of credit to a single industry or borrower  and its loans are spread throughout its market area 
the corporation s legal lending limit to any one borrower is approximately million  however  it generally limits its loans to any one borrower and related interests to million 
in special cases  the corporation may exceed its internal guideline 
one of the corporation s specialty loan areas is the automobile finance area  and loans are made to consumers  both directly through the corporation s branch network and indirectly through automobile dealerships 
roughly of the total loan portfolio is comprised of consumer automobile loans  but because loan amounts are relatively small and spread across many individual borrowers  the risk of any major charge offs is minimized 
the corporation s automobile loans consist primarily of the highest quality loans  commonly referred to in the industry as a and b quality loans 
these loans contain substantially fewer risk characteristics than lower quality c and d subprime loans and have lower delinquencies  charge offs and collection costs 
during periods of economic weakness  subprime loan categories generate very high delinquencies and charge offs  while the high quality loans the corporation specializes in experience only modestly higher delinquencies and charge offs 
the corporation also makes loans directly to high quality automobile dealers to finance their inventories 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets continued to decline in by million to million as compared to million at the end of as a percentage of total loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure  nonperforming assets declined five basis points to  a record low for the corporation 
the ratio of nonperforming assets has been steadily declining since and has consistently been much lower than the average for similar sized banks in the corporation s national and regional peer groups 
there were no concentrations of foreclosed real estate or nonaccruing loans in any specific geographic location or type of property  and the majority of nonperforming assets were comprised of smaller balance loans to consumers

loans past due days or more also declined at the end of by million to million or

of total loans at the end of the corporation s delinquency ratio is significantly below industry averages and reflects the high overall quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans are classified as nonaccrual when full collectibility of principal or interest is in doubt  when repossession  foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings are initiated  or when other legal actions are taken 
installment loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when payments are delinquent days 
all other loans are generally placed in nonaccrual status when they are days delinquent 
loans may be classified as nonaccrual sooner if specific conditions indicate impairment is probable 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to an accruing status when principal and interest are no longer past due and future collection of principal and interest are not in doubt 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
at the end of  loans of this type that are not included in the above table of nonperforming and past due loans amounted to approximately million 
the majority of these loans represent commercial or property related loans 
depending on changes in the economy and other future events  these loans and others not presently identified as problem loans could be reclassified as nonperforming or impaired loans in the future 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 
due to the homogeneous nature of a large percentage of the corporation s outstanding loans  a significant portion of the allowance is not determined by individual loan reviews 
rather  the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for loan losses are evaluated by management based on the value of underlying collateral  economic conditions and unique marketplace factors that might affect the collectibility of the loans 
as a result  these judgments involve an inherently higher degree of uncertainty 
historical results and loss experience may not reflect this risk to the extent it might currently exist 
for other portions of the corporation s loan portfolio  management assesses the adequacy of the allowance based on a review of individual loans and commitments where internal credit evaluations result in ratings that are below standards adopted and periodically updated by the corporation 
other risk factors taken into account include recent loss experience in specific loan categories  underwriting standards and changes in credit quality  and changes in volumes or concentrations of credit risk 
reserve coverage ratio the higher  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group net charge off ratio the lower  the better national first southern peer virginia regionals group in the case of construction  commercial and commercial real estate loans  each loan is reviewed and rated at least annually  and trends in the total portfolio are examined for potential deterioration in overall quality

this component of the overall allowance is relatively small and totaled million at the end of  including 
million for loans classified as impaired 
loans specifically reviewed comprise of the total loan portfolio  and the allocated allowance for these loans represented approximately of the total allowance for loan losses 
the remainder of the allowance is unallocated and provides for general economic conditions and the of the loan portfolio that is comprised of small  homogeneous loans to consumers 
no specific allocation of the allowance is made for individual loans in this category 
instead  these loans are divided into various groups with similar characteristics and evaluated collectively 
these loans tend to be for relatively short durations of three to seven years and are generally secured by automobiles or residential real estate and have fairly consistent charge off experience 
net charge offs declined significantly in to

allowance for loan losses to year end loans liquidity and sensitivity to interest rates the primary functions of asset liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time period 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of the corporation s loan and deposit customers 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation does not hedge its position with swaps  options or futures but instead maintains a highly liquid and short term position in substantially all of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
one of the primary ways the corporation meets its liquidity needs is by scheduling the maturity of its investment securities so that approximately an equal amount will mature each month 
the weighted average life of the securities portfolio at the end of was months  unchanged from the end of because the corporation views its securities portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity and safety  it does not necessarily react to changes in the yield curve in an attempt to enhance its yield 
accordingly  the average life of the portfolio remains relatively stable as the corporation maintains a constant approach to its portfolio and invests primarily in us government and agency securities with a life generally no greater than five years 
municipal securities are also generally limited to lives of no more than five years  but availability and other factors mean they are occasionally purchased in serial issues with longer lives 
a cash reserve consisting primarily of overnight investments is also maintained by the parent company to meet any contingencies and to provide additional capital  if needed  to the affiliate banks 
most of the corporation s loans are fixed rate installment loans to consumers and mortgage loans with maturities longer than the deposits by which they are funded 
a degree of interest rate risk is incurred if the interest rate on deposits should rise before the loans mature 
however  the substantial liquidity provided by the monthly repayments on these loans can be reinvested at higher rates that largely reduce the interest rate risk 
home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates that are tied to the prime rate 
many of the loans not in the installment or mortgage categories have maturities of less than one year or have floating rates that may be adjusted periodically to reflect current market rates 
these loans are summarized in the following table between year and after or less years years total in thousands commercial  financial agricultural and other     construction and land development     total     floating rate loans included above commercial  financial  agricultural and other    construction and land development    total    first virginia s asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing the corporation s liquidity requirements and maximizing the corporation s net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
liquidity requirements are reviewed in detail for each of the corporation s affiliate banks  however  overall asset liability management is performed on a consolidated basis to achieve a consistent and coordinated approach 
one of the tools the corporation uses to determine its interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to examine the volume of interest rate sensitive assets minus interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the difference between the two is the interest sensitivity gap  and it indicates how future changes in interest rates may affect net interest income 
regardless of whether interest rates are expected to increase or decrease  the objective is to maintain a gap position that will minimize any changes in net interest income 
a negative gap exists when the corporation has more interest sensitive liabilities maturing within a certain time period than interest sensitive assets 
under this scenario  if interest rates were to increase it would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   the corporation was liability sensitive in the short term under six months by approximately of earning assets  which declines to in months 
technically  the corporation may reprice interest checking  savings and insured money markets at any time and  accordingly  they have been classified in the day sensitivity category in the following table 
however  the degree and frequency of movement is more limited in practice  and they are much less sensitive than contractually possible

x x x first virginia also uses simulation analysis to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  changes in interest rates and volumes are used to test the sensitivity of first virginia s net interest income 
simulation analysis uses a more dynamic version of the information shown in the preceding table that includes adjustments for the expected timing and magnitude of changes in assets and liabilities 
these adjustments take into account that interest rates on individual asset and liability categories may change at a different pace from their contractual rate 
a large part of first virginia s loans and deposits come from its retail base  and they do not automatically reprice on a contractual basis in reaction to changes in interest rates 
while first virginia s liability sensitivity in the short term indicates that an increase in interest rates may negatively affect short term net interest income  management would likely take actions to minimize its exposure to negative results and within a relatively short period of time would make adjustments so that net interest income would not be materially impacted 
for example  despite wide changes in rates since  first virginia has maintained a net interest margin above every year and has been able to maintain adequate liquidity to provide for changes in loan and deposit demands 
using shock analysis of a hypothetical  immediate increase in all interest rates of basis points and comparing that to the anticipated interest rate environment over the next months also indicates that net interest income would decrease by  while an immediate and hypothetical decrease in rates of basis points would increase net interest income by 
such an immediate change in all rates would be highly unlikely in management s opinion 
the corporation s dynamic simulation modeling takes into account the effects such changes may have on overall economic activity  the reaction of individual categories of assets and liabilities  and the impact that different management actions may have on net interest income 
accordingly  first virginia has not experienced the volatility its interest sensitive gap position or shock analysis may indicate 
over time  or under stable interest rate conditions  net interest income will tend to be greater at higher interest rate levels 
this is due to the large proportion of low cost core deposits such as demand  interest checking  savings and money market accounts comprising the corporation s funding sources  which can be invested in relatively higher yielding loans and investments

quarterly results the results of operations for the first three quarters of have been analyzed in quarterly reports to shareholders

the results of operations for the fourth quarter are highlighted below 
earnings per share of 
in the fourth quarter of represented a improvement compared to the 
earned in the fourth quarter of net income increased nominally by to million compared to million in a lower number of outstanding shares  a direct result of the corporation s share repurchase program  caused diluted earnings per share to increase at the faster pace 
the return on assets during the fourth quarter was compared to the earned in the prior year  while the return on equity was compared to in the prior year s fourth quarter 
first virginia s cash basis earnings  excluding both the effect of intangible assets and related amortization expense associated with acquisitions and nonrecurring gains in  equaled million in and million in this resulted in a return on average tangible assets in the fourth quarter of of  a return on average tangible equity of and an efficiency ratio of  compared to  and  respectively  in the fourth quarter 
total assets at the end of were billion  a decrease of compared to the billion at the end of average loans increased to billion  a annualized pace compared to the third quarter 
to increase liquidity for potential yk related deposit withdrawals  lending and investing activities were deliberately restricted during the fourth quarter  resulting in an intentional buildup in nonearning cash 
this increase in liquidity contributed to a slight reduction in the net interest margin of three basis points in the fourth quarter to compared to the third quarter s but was more than the achieved in the fourth quarter of the corporation successfully converted all of its systems to year usage  as did most other business and government organizations  and the anticipated yk cash demand did not materialize 
these funds will be reinvested in earning assets in the first quarter of noninterest income declined to million in the fourth quarter of compared to the million earned in s fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter included a gain of million from the sale of a portion of the corporation s credit card portfolio 
the balance of the credit card portfolio was sold in the first quarter of  and  as a consequence  no income from credit card operations was received in the fourth quarter compared to million in s fourth quarter 
excluding these items  noninterest income declined only in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of service charge income on deposit accounts increased compared to the fourth quarter of  which  in turn  had risen compared to the fourth quarter of also during the fourth quarter of  the newly implemented customer value based approach to service charges  which resulted in a significant increase in service charges on deposits  was mature by the fourth quarter of  resulting in little comparative gain 
income from trust services rose compared to the fourth quarter  fueled by rising stock values and an increase in the number of accounts under management 
electronic banking service fees declined slightly  following several years of sharp increases as consumers adjusted their pattern of atm usage to avoid charges for transactions at machines not owned by their bank of account 
noninterest expense declined slightly compared to both the prior year s fourth quarter and the third quarter of equipment charges rose compared to the third quarter as final changes were implemented to ensure yk compliance for all of the corporation s systems 
total shareholders equity increased to billion at december   compared to 
billion at the end of during the fourth quarter of   shares were purchased under the company s share repurchase program
