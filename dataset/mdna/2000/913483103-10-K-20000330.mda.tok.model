there were no sales from the discontinued north american retail business line during and none are expected in the future 
gross margins for the year ended december  were compared to for the same period last year 
this increase can be attributed to the sale by the company of substantially all of its remaining inventory in the discontinued north american retail business at average selling prices that approximated book value during the first half of in the company s continuing businesses  gross margins increased to in compared to in this increase can be attributed to higher margins in the company s technology businesses due to the introduction of new products in  and cost reductions in certain component parts in late and throughout selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses was in compared to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in payroll and bonus related costs  increased bad debt expense  and increased depreciation and amortization expense  offset by lower telephone costs

depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in depreciation expense increased as a result of the million increase in fixed assets with a shorter useful life during the increase in amortization expense can be attributed to a full year of amortization expense in on goodwill from acquisitions and non compete agreements entered into in compared to a partial year of amortization expense in on such intangibles as well as additional amortization expense on the goodwill associated with the acquisition of a spanish distributor in telephone costs decreased by 
million in compared to due primarily to rate reductions in europe as a result of increased provider competition  and cost efficiencies from the elimination of unused toll free lines and the implementation of more efficient telephone systems and consumer support programs

net sales in the company s technology businesses subscription broadcasting  oem and private label were approximately of net sales in compared to in net sales in the company s technology businesses for increased by million or  from million in to million in sales to subscription broadcasting providers and oems increased by million or  from million in to million in driven primarily by continued strong demand in new remote control business with the providers of cable and satellite broadcast services

net sales of eversafe products decreased by million or  from million in to million in primarily due to weaker demand 
the direct import business line began during the first quarter of  with royalty income and significant initial chip sales of million for net sales in from the discontinued north american retail business one for all us and canada were approximately of overall net sales compared to in net sales in of the company s discontinued north american retail product line decreased from million to million as the company sold off its remaining inventory for this business line at an amount just below its carrying value 
the company s overall gross margin in was compared to a gross margin of in in the company s continuing businesses  the gross margin increased to in compared to in this increase can be attributed to improved margins in the company s subscription broadcasting and one for all international businesses due primarily to reduced product costs 
in the company s discontinued north american retail business  the gross margin decreased from million or in to a negative gross margin of  in as the company sold the remaining product in this line at average selling prices just below its carrying value 
in  the north american retail product inventories were written down by million to a carrying value of approximately million from a carrying value prior to the write down of approximately million 
the purpose of this write down was to carry this inventory at what management believed its estimated net realizable value was as a result of the discontinuation of this business 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in in dollars  the company s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased during to million from million in advertising and payroll expenses decreased during by approximately and million  respectively  which were partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of 
million 
the reductions in advertising costs were attributable to the elimination of retail related advertising programs for the company s discontinued north american retail product line 
the payroll decreases were a result of headcount reductions associated with the discontinuation of the north american retail product line 
the increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of additional goodwill from businesses acquired and non compete covenants entered into in in connection with the discontinuation of the north american retail product line  the company increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million in the fourth quarter of this increase primarily related to certain customer accounts of the company that were deemed at risk due to the company s exit from this business 
in december  the company announced its decision to discontinue its north american one for all retail business 
as part of that announcement  the company advised its employees  stockholders and the investment community generally that it would recognize a pre tax charge of million during the fourth quarter of the table below depicts the costs associated with this action type of cost amount severance and related employee benefit costs  prepaid advertising for retail products  fixed assets  intangible assets trademarks  consumer support and service  prepaid assets  other retail business exit costs  severance and related employee benefits were determined by adding such estimated amounts for each of the employees of the company that were terminated in the restructuring 
prepaid advertising amounts represent trade credits for various types of advertising that were obtained by the company in and in exchange for remote control product 
these prepaid advertising credits were recorded by the company at the carrying value of the inventory exchanged 
the advertising obtained in these arrangements was exclusively geared toward retail products 
therefore  these credits were written off as part of the discontinuation of the company s north american one for all retail business 
fixed asset charges consisted primarily of the company s twinsburg facility  tooling associated with the company s north american one for all retail product  and equipment dedicated to the company s north american one for all retail line 
the book value of the plant and leasehold improvements for the company s twinsburg facility was compared to the estimated market value of the building pursuant to an existing purchase offer received from a non affiliated third party to determine the necessary charge 
the company s twinsburg facility was sold in august at a value approximating the book value after the write down with no material gain or loss 
charges for all other fixed assets and prepaid assets were determined by comparing net book values to estimated fair market values 
the fair market values used in these comparisons represent the company s estimates based on an assessment of the usefulness of each item within the other business lines of the company 
gains or losses resulting from the dispositions of these adjusted fixed assets in were not material 
the unamortized value of the trademarks used solely on products that were discontinued and determined by the company to not be usable in its on going businesses were written off in their entirety 
consumer support and service costs relate to on going contractual obligations of the company to provide telephonic support for certain of its products that were discontinued as part of this restructuring 
under the company s plan  the company anticipated that the discontinuation would i reduce its annual overhead by approximately million as a result of significantly reducing the advertising associated with the retail business  eliminating the costs associated with owning and operating the twinsburg facility  terminating employees during the first half of  reducing the company s amortization expense as a result of writing off certain of the company s trademarks used solely on products that were discontinued and determined by the company to not be usable in its on going businesses  and eliminating costs associated with obtaining and holding an inventory of products for sale to its retail customers  and ii create a profitable new marketing and distribution channel for certain of its technology and trademarks by licensing them to third party distributors and manufacturers for their use in the domestic retail markets 
as the company anticipated when it made its december announcement  the discontinuation occurred primarily during the first half of and was completed during the third quarter 
during this transition  the company continued to support its retail customers by selling through its remaining inventory of north american retail remote control products 
thereafter  in accordance with the company s plan  the company licensed certain of its proprietary technology and its one for all trademark to a third party overseas manufacturer  to enable them to supply several of these customers with a limited number of remote control products on a direct import basis 
during the first half of  the company relocated its headquarters from its twinsburg  ohio facility to its technology center in cypress  california 
in connection with this move  all of the company s operations and administrative functions were moved to its new headquarters  with the exception of its customer service phone center  which remained in the company s twinsburg facility 
in the third quarter of  the company sold its twinsburg facility to a third party at a price of million and leased back a portion of it to house its customer service phone center on terms which the company believed to be competitive 
the carrying value of the building at the time of the sale was approximately million and the company recognized a loss on the sale of the building of approximately  a reserve for expected cash expenditures of million was established as part of the company s fourth quarter restructuring 
during  the company completed this restructuring and used the reserve in its entirety 
the restructuring proceeded according to the company s plan and was completed without any significant changes to the plan 
the following table details the type and amount of costs charged against the reserve during type of cost amount severance and related employee benefit costs  consumer support and service  other retail business exit costs  interest expense decreased by  in to  from  in due to reduced borrowing under the company s revolving letter agreement and lower average borrowing costs 
other expense increased to  in from  in this occurred as a result of higher net currency exchange losses from the company s international operations 
the company had an effective income tax rate for of as compared to in the difference in the rate as compared to the rate was primarily due to differences in nol carryforward limitations in california versus ohio due to the relocation of the company s headquarters from ohio to california 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds are its operations and bank credit facilities 
cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities during of million and cash used for operating activities during of  the improvement in cash flow from operating activities is principally due to the significant increase in income before taxes  depreciation and amortization in and the effect of cash payments incurred during to complete the discontinuation of the north american retail product line and restructuring announced in late on october   the company paid off its outstanding credit line with the provident bank and entered into a million revolving credit agreement with bank of america national trust and savings association b of a 
under the revolving credit agreement with b of a  the company can choose from several interest rate options at its discretion 
the interest rate in effect as of december  using the fixed rate option as defined in the agreement  which is intended to approximate b of a s cost of funds  plus an applicable margin was 
the applicable margin varies with a range from to per annum depending on the company s net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at december   the applicable margin was percent 
the revolving credit facility  which expires october   is secured by a first priority security interest in the company s cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and general intangibles of the company 
the company pays a commitment fee of a maximum rate of of per year on the unused portion of the credit line 
under the terms of this revolving credit agreement  the company s ability to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted and the company is subject to certain financial covenants and other restrictions that are standard for these types of agreements 
however  the company has authority under this credit facility to acquire up to  shares of its common stock in market purchases and  since the date of this agreement  the company has acquired approximately  shares of stock  at a cost of approximately  which it holds as treasury shares and are available for reissue by the company 
amounts available for borrowing under this credit facility are reduced by the outstanding balance of the company s import letters of credit 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility 
the company had no outstanding import letters of credit as of december  open market purchases of the company s common stock under a program announced in amounted to zero in  approximately million during and  in the company holds all of these shares as treasury stock and they are available for reissue by the company 
presently  except for using a small number of these treasury shares to compensate its outside board members  the company has no plans to distribute these shares although the company may change these plans if necessary to fulfill its on going business objectives 
in addition  during  the company received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options granted to the company s current and former employees  as compared to approximately million in and  in the primary reason for the significant increase in stock option exercises during and was that the company s stock began to trade at relatively high levels towards the second half of and into and many employees  as well as former employees who were terminated during as part of the company s restructuring principally the company s former chairman of the board  elected to exercise their options 
capital expenditures in  and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these expenditures related primarily to acquiring product tooling in each year and relocating the company s headquarters from twinsburg  ohio to cypress  california during the company has currently budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in primarily for acquiring product tooling 
effective july   the company completed its acquisition of a remote control distributor in spain for  in cash 
during the third quarter of  the company acquired a remote control company in the united states for million  for which  shares of newly issued company common stock valued at  were issued and million was paid in cash 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired a remote control distributor in the united kingdom for million in cash  of which million was paid in and the remaining million was paid in historically  the company s working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
however  due to the discontinuation of the company s north american retail line and the increasing significance of the company s other lines of business including subscription broadcasting and oem  the company expects that this seasonality will be lessened 
at december   the company had million of working capital compared to million at december  the increase in working capital is principally due to increases in accumulated cash and cash equivalents and higher accounts receivable balances due from customers at december  it is the company s policy to carefully monitor the state of its business  cash requirements and capital structure 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and available from its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth at least through the end of  however  there can be no assurances that this will occur 
year readiness disclosures as previously reported  over the past several years the company developed and implemented a plan to address the anticipated impacts of the so called year problem on its information technology it systems and non it systems 
the company also surveyed selected third parties to determine the status of their year compliance programs 
in addition  contingency plans were developed specifying what the company would do if it or important third parties experienced disruptions to critical business activities as a result of the year problem 
the company s year plan was completed in all material respects prior to the anticipated year failure dates 
as of march   the company has not experienced any materially important business disruptions or system failures as a result of year issues  nor is it aware of any year issues that have impacted its customers  suppliers or other significant third parties to an extent significant to the company 
however  year compliance has many elements and potential consequences  some of which may not be foreseeable or may be realized in future periods 
consequently  there can be no assurance that unforeseen circumstances may not arise  or that the company will not in the future identify equipment or systems which are not year compliant 
as of december   the company s total incremental costs of addressing year issues were approximately  this amount has been incurred and was funded through operating cash flow 
in addition  the company has performed a full internal evaluation of its non information technology systems and products 
based upon that evaluation and certain ongoing tests that the company performs from time to time  it believes that its non information technology systems and products are year compliant 
because of these ongoing evaluations  the company sells its products with year compliance warranties 
although the company strongly believes that its products are year compliant and provides year compliance warranties with its products  there can be no assurance that the company has identified all possible year product issues and that any such issues would not have an adverse financial impact on the company 
risk factors forward looking statements the company cautions that the following important factors  among others including but not limited to factors discussed below  in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report of the form k  and as mentioned from time to time in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  could affect the company s actual results and could cause or contribute to the company s actual consolidated results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
the factors included here are not exhaustive 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors  nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
therefore  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future results 
while management believes that the forward looking statements made in this report are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual outcome of such statements is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including continued acceptance of the company s technology and products  the impact of competitive pressures  including products and pricing  locating and finalizing acceptable acquisition targets and or strategic partners  the availability of financing for acquisitions on terms acceptable to the company  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the consolidation of and new competition experienced by members in the cable industry  principally from satellite and other similar broadcast providers  general economic and stock market conditions and other risks which are otherwise set forth in this annual report on form k and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
dependence upon key suppliers most of the components used in the company s products are available from multiple sources  however  the company has elected to purchase integrated circuit components used in the company s products  principally its wireless control products  and certain other components used in the company s products  from two main sources  each of which provide in excess of ten percent of the company s microprocessors for use in its products 
the company has developed alternative sources of supply for these integrated circuit components 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to obtain these components on a timely basis 
the company generally maintains inventories of its integrated chips  which could be used in part to mitigate  but not eliminate  delays resulting from supply interruptions 
an extended interruption  shortage or termination in the supply of any of the components used in the company s products  or a reduction in their quality or reliability  or a significant increase in prices of components  would have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on foreign manufacturing third party manufacturers located in foreign countries manufacture all of the company s wireless controls 
the company s arrangements with its foreign manufacturers are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  political instability and other factors which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company believes that the loss of any one or more of its manufacturers would not have a long term material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations because numerous other manufacturers are available to fulfill the company s requirements  however  the loss of any of the company s major manufacturers could adversely effect the company s business until alternative manufacturing arrangements are secured 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly financial results may vary significantly depending primarily upon factors such as the timing of significant orders  the timing of new product offerings by the company and its competitors and product presentations and the loss or acquisition of any significant customers 
in addition  historically the company s business has been seasonal  with the largest proportion of sales occurring in september  october and november of each calendar year 
factors such as quarterly variations in financial results could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and cause it to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company i may from time to time increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  increase its sales and marketing activities  develop new distribution channels  improve its operational and financial systems and broaden its customer support capabilities and ii may incur significant operating expenses associated with any new acquisitions 
to the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely effected 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors  including demand for the company s products  introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  the loss or acquisition of any significant customers  market acceptance of new products  price reductions by the company or its competitors  mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  level of product returns  mix of customers and products sold  component pricing  mix of international and domestic revenues  and general economic conditions 
in addition  as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment  the company may from time to time make certain pricing or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely effected 
dependence on consumer preference the company is susceptible to fluctuations in its business based upon consumer demand for its products 
the company believes that its success depends in substantial part on its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to such fluctuations in consumer demand 
however  it is impossible to predict with complete accuracy the occurrence and effect of any such event that will cause such fluctuations in consumer demand for the company s products 
moreover  the company cautions that any increases in sales or growth in revenue that it achieves may be transitory and should by no means be construed to mean that such increases or growth will continue 
dependence upon timely product introduction the company s ability to remain competitive in the wireless control products market will depend in part upon its ability to successfully identify new product opportunities and to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or in enhancing its existing products  or that such new or enhanced products will achieve consumer acceptance  and if acquired  will sustain that acceptance  that products developed by others will not render the company s products non competitive or obsolete or that the company will be able to obtain or maintain the rights to use proprietary technologies developed by others which are incorporated in the company s products 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the introduction of new products which the company may introduce in the future may require the expenditure of a significant amount of funds for research and development  tooling  manufacturing processes  inventory and marketing 
in order to achieve high volume production of any new product  the company may have to make substantial investments in inventory and expand its production capabilities 
dependence on major customers the company s performance is affected by the economic strength and weakness of its worldwide customers 
the company sells its wireless control products and proprietary technologies to private label customers  original equipment manufacturers oems  and companies involved in the subscription broadcasting industry 
the company also supplies its products to its wholly owned  non us subsidiaries and to independent foreign distributors  who in turn distribute the company s products worldwide  with europe  australia  new zealand  mexico and selected countries in asia and latin america currently representing the company s principal foreign markets 
in  the company lost a significant customer in its subscription broadcasting business due to that customer being acquired by a third party 
during  the company had two customers that acquired more than ten percent of the company s products and the loss of either of these customers or any of the company s other key customers either in the united states or abroad due to the financial weakness or bankruptcy of any such customer or the inability of the company to obtain orders or maintain its order volume with its major customers may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
competition the wireless control industry is characterized by intense competition based primarily on product availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and depth of product lines 
the company s competition is fragmented across its product lines  and accordingly  the company does not compete with any one company across all product lines 
the company competes with a variety of entities  some of which have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company s ability to remain competitive in this industry depends in part on its ability to successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis as well as its ability to identify and enter into strategic alliances with entities doing business within the industries the company serves 
there can be no assurances that the company and its product offerings will be and or remain competitive or that any strategic alliances  if any  which the company enters into will achieve the type  extent and amount of success or business that the company expects or hopes to achieve 
potential for litigation as is typical in the company s industry and the nature and kind of business in which the company is engaged  from time to time  various claims  charges and litigation are asserted or commenced by third parties against the company or by the company against third parties arising from or related to product liability  infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights  breach of warranty  contractual relations  or employee relations 
the amounts claimed may be substantial but may not bear any reasonable relationship to the merits of the claims or the extent of any real risk of court awards 
while it is the opinion of management that the company s products do not infringe any third parties patent or other intellectual property rights  the costs associated with defending or pursuing any such claims or litigation could be substantial and amounts awarded as final judgments  if any  in any such potential or pending litigation  could have a significant and material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
general economic conditions general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  have an impact on the company s business and financial results 
from time to time the markets in which the company sells its products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect the sales of the company s products 
to the extent that general economic conditions affect the demand for products sold by the company  such conditions could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
restructuring efforts the company believes that the discontinuation of its north american retail business and its subsequent restructuring favorably impacted the company s ongoing operations due to i reductions in the company s annual overhead which were a result of closing the company s twinsburg  ohio facility  ii eliminating employee and other costs associated with operating this business  and iii generating revenues from licensing certain of its technology and trademarks 
there can be no assurance that any such cost savings or revenues will continue to occur and if they do  that they will be significant or maintained 
effects on the company due to international operations by operating its business in countries outside of the united states  the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  exchange ratios  nationalization or expropriation of assets  import export controls  political instability  variations in the protection of intellectual property rights  limitations on foreign investments and restrictions on the ability to convert currency 
these risks are inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  with customers speaking different languages and having different cultural approaches to the conduct of business  any one of which alone or collectively  may have an adverse affect on the company s international operations  and consequently on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
while the company will continue to work toward minimizing any adverse affects of conducting its business abroad  no assurance can be made that the company will be successful in minimizing any such affects 
outlook the company s focus in is to continue to seek ways to increase its customer base worldwide  particularly in the areas of subscription broadcasting  oem  and its one for all international retail business 
in addition  the company will increase its focus on creating new applications for its proprietary and or patented technologies in the consumer electronics oem market  and computer internet control markets 
the company will also continue in to control its overall cost of doing business 
management believes that through product design changes and its purchasing efforts  improvements in the company s gross margins and efficiencies in its selling  general and administrative expenses can be accomplished  although there can be no assurances that there will be any improvements to the company s gross margin or that the company will achieve any cost savings through these efforts and if obtained  that any such improvements or savings will be significant or maintained 
in addition  during  management will continue to pursue its overall strategy of seeking out ways to operate all aspects of the company more profitably 
this strategy will include looking at acceptable acquisition targets and strategic partnership opportunities 
the company cautions  however  that no assurances can be made that any suitable acquisition targets or partnership opportunities will be identified and  if identified  that a transaction can be consummated 
moreover  if consummated  no assurances can be made that any such acquisition or partnership will profitably add to the company s operations 
while management believes that the forward looking statements made in this report are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual outcome of such statements is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including continued acceptance of the company s technology and products  the impact of competitive pressures  including products and pricing  locating and finalizing acceptable acquisition targets and or strategic partners  the availability of financing for acquisitions on terms acceptable to the company  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the consolidation of and new competition experienced by members in the cable industry  principally from satellite and other similar broadcast providers  general economic and stock market conditions and other risks which are otherwise set forth in this annual report on form k and the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the interest payable under the company s revolving credit agreement with its bank is variable and generally based on either the bank s cost of funds  or the ibor rate  and is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   the company had no borrowings on its credit line 
the interest rate in effect on the credit line using the bank s cost of funds rate as the base as of december  was 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in the netherlands  united kingdom  germany and spain 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in local currencies including euros  british pounds  german marks  and spanish pesetas thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the local currencies us dollars exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company  from time to time  enters into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions  primarily foreign currency forward contracts for inventory purchases 
the company had a number of forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  with an aggregate notional value of approximately million 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to the company s assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currencies 
based on the company s overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   the company believes that movements in foreign currency rates should not materially affect the financial position of the company  although no assurance can be made that any such foreign currency rate movements in the future will not have a material affect
