impact of year issue year readiness disclosure made pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  pub 
l 
no 
the year presented potential concerns and issues for the company as well as other companies in the software industry 
in general  year readiness issues typically arise in computer software and hardware systems that use two digit date formats  instead of four digit dates  to represent a particular year 
users must test their unique combination of hardware  system software including databases  transaction processors  and operating systems and application software in order to achieve year readiness 
this issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on financial and other transactions worldwide 
failure of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company established a year steering committee to evaluate  plan and implement policies and practices  including contingency planning  and to address the impact of the year on the company and its products 
the company s year readiness preparations fell into three categories product readiness  addressing product functionality  internal readiness  addressing the year operability of internal information technology it systems and mission critical non it systems  and third party readiness  addressing the preparedness of relevant third parties and the year operability of products furnished for internal use and resale 
the expenses incurred to date have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
at this time  the company does not believe that it will have additional year expenses  but will fund any unanticipated expenses through cash flows from operations 
part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued status of investigation product readiness the company completed testing of its current software products in and believed the most current versions conform to these standards and are year ready 
despite the company s testing  there can be no assurance that the company s products do not contain undetected errors or defects related to year operability that may result in material costs to the company or that the company s products contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  end users and distributors to be year ready 
the company believes a substantial number of the company s customers are running product versions which have not been tested and may experience year date related operability issues 
the company encouraged these to upgrade to current versions of the products 
the company does not believe that the cost of potential upgrades or modifications will have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
while the company believes that most of its current releases of products are year ready  other factors may result in an application created using the company s products not being year ready 
some of these factors include improper programming techniques used by third parties in creating the application  customization  or non compliance of hardware  software or firmware not provided by the company with which the products operate 
the company does not believe that it would be liable in such an event 
however  due to the unprecedented nature of the potential litigation related to year readiness as discussed in the industry and popular press  the most likely worst case scenario is that the company would be subject to litigation 
it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by such litigation 
as of the date of this report the company has not received any year related complaints on its products 
status of investigation internal readiness the company engaged in conducting a year readiness audit of its internal it and non it systems including telecommunication  facilities management  safety and security systems 
bitstream completed its evaluation of these systems and it s business application software 
as a result of this evaluation  bitstream implemented the necessary changes and tested its internal systems to achieve year compliance in this area 
as of the date of this report  bitstream has experienced no material issues or problems relating to year readiness of its internal systems 
status of investigation third party readiness the company s assessment of the year readiness of material third parties  such as public utilities and key clients or suppliers  who provide external services to the company was completed during december of the company has certain key relationships with suppliers which furnish components and software used by the company in its products 
if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they supply to the company  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  reputation  and financial results 
certain of the company s products contain third party components and software that are integral to their operation for which the cost and time to integrate alternative components or software into these products would be material 
the company had received assurances from these parties that they are yk ready 
as of the date of this report  bitstream has experienced no material issues or problems relating to year readiness of its external agents 
part ii  continued item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial intruments  and derivative commodity intruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are short term  investment grade commercial paper  and money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are almost exclusively conducted in their respective local currencies 
international subsidiary operating results are translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for the year ended december  currently the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
