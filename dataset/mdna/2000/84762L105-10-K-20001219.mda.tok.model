item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in the financial statements section of this report 
introduction our operating performance depends upon a number of factors 
the most important of these factors are general retailing trends  especially in the mass merchandiser segment of the retail market our overall product mix among various specialty and general household batteries and battery powered lighting devices  which sell at different price points and profit margins our overall competitive position  which is affected by both our and our competitors introduction of new products and promotions and our relative pricing and battery performance changes in operating expenses we manage our business according to the following geographic areas north america  which includes the united states and canada latin america  which includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean and europe rest of world europe row  which includes the united kingdom  europe  and all other countries in which we do business 
set forth below are specific developments that have affected and may continue to affect our performance 
investment in future growth opportunities 
since our recapitalization  we have undertaken significant measures to pursue growth opportunities and increase market share for our products worldwide 
these measures include acquiring the consumer battery operations of rov limited in latin america and the rayovac brand rights for battery products worldwide  with the exception of brazil  developing new markets for our hearing aid battery products through the acquisitions of brisco and the battery distribution business of best labs in  expanding distribution by gaining new customers and increasing products sold to existing customers 
restructuring operations and other cost rationalization initiatives 
in september  we announced a series of operational initiatives to take advantage of global marketing opportunities afforded by our latin america acquisition 
these initiatives included the restructuring of the organization to streamline and better serve global markets and improve our overall operating efficiencies  the restructuring of manufacturing operations to position us for future growth and the termination of certain non performing foreign distributors 
expansion of production capacity 
in fiscal we installed a new high speed manufacturing line to increase our capacity for alkaline aa size batteries by up to at a cost of approximately million 
we also completed a  square foot expansion of our portage  wisconsin facility and consolidated our appleton  wisconsin manufacturing operations into it 
we continue to compare our global production requirements against our global manufacturing capacity to improve the efficiency of our operations 
competitive position 
in june  ralston purina company announced that it was spinning off its battery company segment 
according to the form b a filed in april  the new company energizer holdings  inc started trading on the new york stock exchange in april we do not believe this spin off a will create any more favorable market conditions for energizer than before the spin off or b will have a significant adverse impact on our financial performance 
in  duracell introduced duracell ultra in the aa and aaa size categories and this line was expanded in to include d  c  and volt sizes 
duracell has attempted to segment the alkaline battery market by positioning this brand as a premium product priced at a significant premium to their competitors as well as the duracell regular battery brand 
in  energizer followed this strategy by launching energizer e it is premature to determine if this will provide incremental volume to the total energizer franchise 
energizer also increased efforts to obtain distribution behind a price brand eveready alkaline 
the product has minimal advertising support and competes primarily on price 
this initiative has been in place in canada for a number of years with limited success and the current effort to expand in the us has gained only limited distribution

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to mitigate the risk from such exposures 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in note significant accounting policies and practices in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we have bank lines of credit at variable interest rates 
the general level of us interest rates  libor  ibor  and to a lesser extent european base rates  primarily affects interest expense 
we use interest rate swaps to manage such risk 
the net amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change  and are recognized over the life of the swap agreements  as an adjustment to interest expense from the underlying debt to which the swap is designated 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accrued liabilities or accounts receivable 
foreign exchange risk we are subject to risk from sales and loans to our subsidiaries as well as sales to  purchases from and bank lines of credit with  third party customers  suppliers and creditors  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency sales are made primarily in pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euro  german marks  french francs  italian lira  spanish pesetas  dutch guilders  mexican pesos  guatemalan quetzals  dominican pesos  venezuelan bolivars  argentine pesos  chilean pesos and honduran lempira 
foreign currency purchases are made primarily in pounds sterling  german marks  french francs  mexican pesos  dominican pesos  guatemalan quetzals and honduran lempira 
we manage our foreign exchange exposure from anticipated sales  accounts receivable  intercompany loans  firm purchase commitments and credit obligations through the use of naturally occurring offsetting positions borrowing in local currency  forward foreign exchange contracts  foreign exchange rate swaps and foreign exchange options 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the contract counter parties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuation in market prices for purchases of zinc used in the manufacturing process 
we use commodity swaps  calls and puts to manage such risk 
the maturity of  and the quantities covered by  the contracts are closely correlated to our anticipated purchases of the commodities 
the cost of calls  and the premiums received from the puts  are amortized over the life of the contracts and are recorded in cost of goods sold  along with the effects of the swap  put and call contracts 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in accounts payable or accounts receivable 
sensitivity analysis the analysis below is hypothetical and should not be considered a projection of future risks 
earnings projections are before tax 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding interest rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable shift in the underlying interest rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in one year s interest expense on the related debt due to the same shift in interest rates  would be a net gain of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding foreign exchange rate derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying foreign exchange rates would be a loss of million 
the net impact on future cash flows  after also including the gain in value on the related accounts receivable and contractual payment obligations outstanding at september  due to the same change in exchange rates  would be a net gain of million 
as of september   the potential change in fair value of outstanding commodity price derivative instruments  assuming a unfavorable change in the underlying commodity prices would be a loss of million 
the net impact on reported earnings  after also including the reduction in cost of one year s purchases of the related commodities due to the same change in commodity prices  would be a net gain of million
