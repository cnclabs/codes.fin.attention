item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the company for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
general the performance of a radio station group is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the two components of broadcast cash flow are net revenues gross revenues net of agency commissions and operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and corporate general and administrative expense 
the primary source of revenues is the sale of broadcasting time for advertising 
the most significant operating expenses for purposes of the computation of broadcast cash flow are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  and advertising and promotion expenses 
management of the company strives to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
the company s revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  the first calendar quarter generally produces the lowest revenues 
the second and third quarters generally produce the highest revenues 
another measure of operating performance is ebitda 
ebitda consists of operating income or loss excluding depreciation and amortization 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
broadcast cash flow and ebitda do not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other commitments and  accordingly  broadcast cash flow and ebitda are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for dividends  reinvestment in the company s business or other discretionary uses

we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our services  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
however  the company considers the possibility that latent matters could arise to be remote and does not anticipate any significant problems due to year issues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on both the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest paid on borrowings under the credit facility 
a change of in the interest rate earned on short term investments and interest paid under the credit facility would not have had a significant impact on our historical financial statements
