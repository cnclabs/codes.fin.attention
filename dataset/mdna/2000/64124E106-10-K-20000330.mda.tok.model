item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in september  we have been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
we have not derived any revenue from product sales and we expect to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues 
revenues to date have come from three collaborative research agreements and one technology transfer agreement with pfizer  one collaboration with schering plough  one license agreement with american home products and from interest income 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future strategic alliances  technology transfer agreements  joint ventures or financings  if any  the progress of our research and development and technology transfer projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products 
we expect research and development costs to increase significantly over the next several years as our drug development programs progress 
in addition  we expect our general and administrative expenses necessary to support our expanded research and development activities to increase for the foreseeable future 
years ended december   and our fiscal operating revenues decreased percent to million from operating revenues of million  which were significantly lower than fiscal operating revenues of million 
the decrease in was due primarily to the scheduled conclusion in june of the research phase of the schering plough agreement as described below 
the decrease in was also due partly to the conclusion of the schering plough research program together with a reduction in reimbursement revenues from pfizer for human clinical trials conducted in under our npy obesity collaboration and a reduction in license fees as described below 
operating revenues in future periods may fluctuate significantly due to many factors  including those described throughout this section 
our license fees of million in  and million in represent non recurring  nonrefundable fees which relate to the granting of certain commercial licenses and rights to collaborative partners as described below 
license fees in represent recognition of part of a million up front fee paid by pfizer for a non exclusive license to certain aidd intellectual property and the right to employ this technology in its own drug development programs 
license fees in represented a million library access fee from schering plough for access to a portion of our combinatorial chemistry libraries 
research and development costs increased percent to million in as compared to research and development costs increased percent to million in compared to million in these increases are due primarily to an increase in research and development personnel as well as the further expansion of our aidd tm accelerated intelligent drug discovery program for the discovery of new drug candidates 
research and development expenses represented percent  percent and percent of total operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in and percent in from million in these increases are attributed to additional administrative and technical services to support our expanding product pipeline 
other income  consisting primarily of interest income and gains and losses from invested cash and marketable securities  was million in  million in and million in  respectively 
the decrease in compared to and was due primarily to a lower level of invested funds 
we recognized a net loss of million for the year ended december   a net loss of million for the year ended december  and a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increases in net losses are primarily due to a decrease in operating revenues and an increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses due to the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were in the aggregate million and million  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to our use of cash to fund our operating activities together with capital expenditures for plant and equipment 
our aggregate level of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities has fluctuated significantly in the past and is expected to do so in the future as a result of the factors described below 
our cash requirements to date have been met by the proceeds of our financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
our financing activities include three private placement offerings of common stock prior to our initial public offering  underwritten public offerings of our common stock in  and  and the private sale of common stock to pfizer in connection with entering into the pfizer agreements and to american home products in the american home products agreement 
total funding received from these financing activities was approximately million 
our expenditures have been primarily to fund research and development and general and administrative expenses and to construct and equip our research and development facilities 
pfizer in the first quarter of  we entered into the pfizer agreement pursuant to which pfizer made a million equity investment in neurogen and agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for up to five years later extended as described below for our research programs for the discovery of gaba based drugs for the treatment of anxiety and cognitive disorders 
as of december   pfizer has provided million of research funding to the company pursuant to the pfizer agreement  as extended  and million for the achievement of a clinical development milestone 
we are eligible to receive additional milestone payments of up to million if certain development and regulatory objectives are achieved regarding our products subject to the collaboration 
in return  pfizer received the exclusive rights to manufacture and market collaboration anxiolytics and cognition enhancers that act through the family of receptors which interact with the neuro transmitter gaba 
pfizer will pay us royalties based upon net sales levels  if any  for such products 
we and pfizer entered into our second collaborative agreement  the pfizer agreement  in july  pursuant to which pfizer made an additional million equity investment in neurogen and agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for up to four years later extended as described below for our research program for the development of gaba based drugs for the treatment of sleep disorders 
as of december   pfizer had provided million of research funding to the company pursuant to the pfizer agreement  as extended  and million for the achievement of a clinical development milestone 
we could also receive additional milestone payments of up to million if certain development and regulatory objectives are achieved regarding our products subject to the collaboration 
in return  pfizer received the exclusive rights to manufacture and market gaba based sleep disorder products for which it will pay us royalties based upon net sales levels  if any 
in december and again in december  we and pfizer extended and combined our research efforts under the and agreements 
pursuant to the extension agreements  we received million in which amount is included in the above described cumulative totals received for the and agreements and under the extension we expect to receive an additional million during for research and development funding of the company s gaba based anxiety  cognitive enhancer and sleep disorders projects 
under both the pfizer agreement and the pfizer agreement  in addition to making the equity investments and the research and milestone payments noted above  pfizer is responsible for funding the cost of all clinical development and the manufacturing and marketing  if any  of drugs developed from the collaborations 
we and pfizer entered into our third collaborative agreement  the pfizer agreement  in november under this agreement pfizer made an additional million equity investment in neurogen bringing pfizer s ownership of our common stock up to approximately percent 
pfizer also paid us a million license fee 
pfizer also agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for up to five years for our research program for the discovery of drugs which work through the neuropeptide y npy mechanism for the treatment of obesity and other disorders 
as of december   pfizer had provided million in research funding pursuant to the pfizer agreement 
in  pfizer exercised its option under the pfizer agreement to extend the npy research program and also agreed to fund increased neurogen staffing on the program and thereby pay us million to fund a fourth year of research  through october in  pfizer elected to further extend the research program through october and to fund neurogen s research for this fifth year at staffing levels to be determined by us and pfizer 
we could also receive milestone payments of up to approximately million if certain development and regulatory objectives are achieved regarding our products subject to the collaboration 
as part of this third collaboration  pfizer received the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture and market npy based collaboration compounds  subject to certain rights retained by us 
under the pfizer agreement  we will fund a minority share of early stage clinical development costs and have retained the right to manufacture any collaboration products in nafta countries 
we have also retained a profit sharing option with respect to product sales in nafta countries 
if we exercise the profit sharing option  we will fund a portion of the cost of late stage clinical trials and marketing costs and in return will receive a specified percentage of any profit generated by sales of collaboration products in nafta countries 
if we choose not to exercise our profit sharing option  pfizer would pay us royalties on drugs marketed in nafta countries and will fund a majority of early stage and all late stage development and marketing expenses 
in either case we would be entitled to royalties on drugs marketed in non nafta countries 
in june  we and pfizer entered into a technology transfer agreement  the pfizer technology transfer agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  pfizer has agreed to pay us up to a total of million over a three year period for the licensing and transfer to pfizer of certain of our aidd tm technologies for the discovery of new drugs  along with the installation of an aidd system 
additional payments are also possible upon pfizer s successful utilization of this technology 
pfizer has received a non exclusive license to certain aidd intellectual property  and the right to employ this technology in its own drug development programs 
as of december   the company had received million in license fees pursuant to the pfizer aidd agreement of which million has been recognized in remaining revenues associated with amounts received under the pfizer technology transfer agreement will be recognized in future periods and may fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and completion of our transfer of technology and systems 
schering plough in june  we and schering plough entered into the schering plough agreement to collaborate in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of schizophenia and other disorders which act through the dopamine family of receptors 
under the schering plough agreement  we received one time license fees of million for rights relating to neurogen s dopamine program and million in and again in for the right to test certain of our combinatorial chemistry libraries in selected non cns assays 
we received scheduled funding totaling approximately million during the three year period from june through june  for research and development funding of our dopamine program 
in july  we announced that the company and schering plough had concluded the research phase of the collaboration 
therefore  the funding of million per year formerly received from schering plough came to its scheduled conclusion on july  although we currently believe it unlikely that they would do so  should schering plough elect to continue the development of drug candidates subject to the collaboration  we could also receive milestone payments of up to approximately million if certain development and regulatory objectives are achieved 
in return  schering plough received the exclusive worldwide license to market dopamine based products subject to the collaboration 
we retained the rights to receive royalties based on net sales levels  if any  and an option to manufacture products for the united states market 
in addition to the payments described above  schering plough is responsible for funding the cost of all clinical development and marketing  if any  of drugs subject to the collaboration 
we plan to use our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for our research and development activities  working capital and general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that our current cash balance  as supplemented by research funding pursuant to the pfizer agreements will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through however  our funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to  the progress of the our research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our proposed products  the status of competitive products and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  manufacturing and marketing products 
we anticipate that we may augment our cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities and further corporate alliances 
no assurances can be given that adequate levels of additional funding can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits  respectively  available for federal income tax purposes which expire from the years through we also had approximately million and million of connecticut state tax net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits  respectively  which expire in the years through because of change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  our utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
neurogen is required to adopt sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 in fiscal sfas no 
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
the company has not entered into any derivative financial instrumentsor hedging activities 
as a result  management believes adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on the financial statements 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued its staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
a  provides guidance on the measurement and timing of revenue recognition in financial statements of public companies 
changes in accounting policies to apply the guidance of sab no 
must be adopted by recording the cumulative effect of the change in the fiscal quarter ending june  management has not yet determined the effect sab no 
will have  if any  on its accounting policies or the amount of the cumulative effect to be recorded from adopting sab no 
discussion of the year issue our program to address the year issue consisted of assessment  remediation  testing and contingency planning 
our program was initiated and executed to prevent major interruptions in the business due to year problems 
as of december   all phases were completed 
we did not experience any significant disruption as a result of the year issue 
the total cost of the year program was approximately  primarily for the cost of replacing upgrading noncompliant software 
we completed our assessment of our year risks related to significant relationships with our critical third party suppliers and customers 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that all supplier and customer year compliance plans were successfully completed in a timely manner  although we are not currently aware of any problems which would significantly impact our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  funds available from investment activities are dependent upon available investment rates 
these funds may be higher or lower than anticipated due to interest rate volatility 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner is dependent upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
