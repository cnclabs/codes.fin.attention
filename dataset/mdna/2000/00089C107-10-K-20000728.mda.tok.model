item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ade was founded in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device and data storage manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group  ade phase shift and ade technologies 
the semiconductor systems group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
ade phase shift manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ade technologies manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gaging systems primarily for the data storage industry 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon shipment  provided evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods the services are provided 
we do not provide the right to return products 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue from software consulting services provided on a time and reimbursable expense basis is recognized as the services are provided 
on june   ade merged with phase shift technology  inc  an arizona corporation 
each outstanding share of phase shift s common stock was exchanged for two shares of the ade s common stock 
a total of  shares of our common stock were issued in this transaction 
this transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all prior period financial statements have been restated to reflect the inclusion of phase shift operations 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development purchased in process research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations other income  net net income loss restructuring in january  we began the consolidation of our charlotte  north carolina operations and certain of our milpitas  california operations into our massachusetts facilities to better align our cost structure with prevailing semiconductor and data storage market conditions and to position ourselves with more efficient operations for expected industry recoveries 
anticipated savings upon the completion of the consolidation efforts include reduced cost of sales due to reduced capacity related expense  reduced payroll and related costs and reduced travel costs 
expenses associated with these consolidations incurred in fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
the fiscal consolidation expenses included a restructuring charge of million and million in other non recurring expenses 
the restructuring charges include severance costs of million related to the termination of employees in general and administrative  marketing and sales  manufacturing  and engineering functions   in lease termination penalties and  in non cash fixed asset impairments related to furniture  fixtures and building improvements on the terminated leased facilities 
other non recurring expenses include travel  consulting  and employee retention bonuses and have been included in general and administrative expenses 
retention bonus expense related to payments to employees who had been notified of their termination dates  but whose services were required through specified dates during the consolidation process 
this expense has been recorded ratably over the respective estimated service periods 
during fiscal we have incurred recruiting costs and labor redundancy costs associated with replacing certain personnel in charlotte who elected not to relocate to massachusetts 
moving and related costs have been incurred through the end of january and have been included in general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charge activity during fiscal and fiscal and the related accrual as of april  is as follows balance at may  restructuring provision  non cash fixed asset impairments lease termination payments balance at april   severance payments balance at april  realizability of deferred tax assets during the year ended april   we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million  as the full value of our net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences may not be realized 
this increase was based upon weighing all evidence available to management  including fiscal pre tax losses of million  current estimates of future taxable income  the cyclicality of the semiconductor and data storage industries and the current uncertainty within those markets 
net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal and begin to expire in fiscal for state income tax purposes and in fiscal for federal income tax purposes 
we will need to generate approximately million of future taxable income to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets as of april  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could materially change in the near term if estimates of future taxable income change or do not materialize 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales our products 
increased sales of the company s products were primarily due to an increase in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries as well as the computer hard disk industry 
capital equipment utilization at wafer and device manufacturers has improved  resulting in some capital equipment purchases to adjust capacity on existing lines 
advanced industry requirements driven by shrinking device dimensions and larger silicon wafers have resulted in technology purchases to evaluate the company s next generation of products 
revenue from sales to japan ade ltd  our owned affiliate and a distributor of our products  by the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies are reflected in segment revenue during the period they are shipped by the respective segment  which can differ from the period the revenue is recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on sales to japan ade ltd is recognized when the related product or software is shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
consolidated revenue in fiscal was million more than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue that was recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but recognized in a prior period on a segment basis 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in the gross margin resulted primarily from the effect of increased sales volume and a reduction in material costs due to decreased excess and obsolete inventory expense during fiscal compared to fiscal in order to increase our capacity utilization  ade has completed the consolidation of the semiconductor systems group manufacturing operations from charlotte  north carolina into the westwood  massachusetts facility 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the decrease in expense resulted from cost control measures implemented during fiscal compared to fiscal the company has continued its development efforts to enhance its existing mm and advanced mm wafer systems as its semiconductor industry customers seek to improve their yields on mm wafers as well as efforts to develop and enhance bridge tools  which can be used with either mm or mm wafers 
the company also continues to develop new products for the computer disk industry  including those which measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the company is committed to continuing its investment in research and development to maintain its position as a technological leader  which may necessitate continued research and development spending at or above current levels 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increased expense resulted primarily from increased commissions expense due to increased sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal also contributing to the increase was an increase in marketing expense due to an investment by the company to enhance device marketing 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
expenses increased primarily as a result of expenses related to the final consolidation of the charlotte operations into the westwood  massachusetts facility 
other income 
other income was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest and other income of million was partially offset by interest expense of  associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and semiconductor systems group manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ade technologies in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the ade phase shift manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in versus a benefit of million in fiscal the fiscal provision for income taxes consisted of state and foreign income taxes 
the increase in deferred tax assets during fiscal was offset entirely by an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was and differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of a million increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of april   partially offset by alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal decreased sales of our products were primarily due to reduced demand for capital equipment 
semiconductor systems group revenue decreased  reflecting the excess capacity for mm wafer production and continued delays in implementing production of mm wafers 
our capital equipment systems are sold primarily at the beginning of the semiconductor production process  with percent of consolidated revenue coming from semiconductor wafer manufacturers 
within the semiconductor device market  which accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue  there have been positive statements of an industry recovery by leading device manufacturers 
most of our wafer making customers  however  have not been profitable for more than a year 
consequently  these customers continue to implement strict controls on capital expenditures  which has adversely impacted sales of our equipment 
ade phase shift and ade technologies revenue decreased and  respectively 
decreased sales of these segments were primarily due to excess capacity and the ongoing consolidation occurring in the data storage industry creating reduced demand for capital equipment 
ade phase shift also experienced decreased sales of its products to the optics and other industries 
while recognition of the importance of a production metrology strategy within the data storage industry is increasing  which would create increased demand for metrology products  we remain cautious as to when capacity driven purchases of our equipment will return 
revenue from sales to japan ade ltd  our owned affiliate and a distributor of our products  by the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies are reflected in segment revenue during the period they are shipped by the respective segment  which can differ from the period the revenue is recognized for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
consolidated revenue on sales to japan ade ltd is recognized when the related product or software is shipped to and accepted by the end user of the product or software 
consolidated revenue in fiscal was million more than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue that was recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but recognized in a prior period on a segment basis 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal semiconductor systems group gross margins decreased primarily due to excess manufacturing capacity and incremental increases in excess and obsolete inventory expense combined with relatively fixed costs associated with its customer service organization 
ade phase shift gross margins remained consistent in fiscal with fiscal  while ade technologies gross margins decreased due to excess manufacturing capacity and significant increases in excess and obsolete inventory expense compared to that incurred in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the increase as a percentage of revenue despite the decrease in absolute expense occurred due to the decrease in revenue in the current year 
semiconductor systems group expense decreased primarily due to significantly reduced consulting expense 
ade phase shift expense decreased primarily due to strict cost control measures implemented as a result of the adverse impact on its revenue from the data storage industry downturn 
ade technologies expense increased due to payroll and project materials increase related to the development of next generation magnetics characterization systems for the data storage industry 
we expect research and development expense to continue to be significant as a percentage of revenue 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the decrease in expense results from decreased sales commissions expense to external sales representatives  primarily in asia  for the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies due to significantly reduced revenue during the period 
the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold may have a significant impact on our marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of expense in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
expense decreased at each of our reportable segments primarily due to our aggressive cost reduction strategy implemented throughout fiscal  which included strict controls over discretionary spending at each of our segments and reductions in workforce at the semiconductor systems group and ade technologies 
these decreases were partially offset by million in non recurring expenses associated with the restructuring discussed above 
other income 
other income was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest income of million was partially offset by interest expense of  associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and semiconductor systems group manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts and the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ade technologies in newton  massachusetts 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the fiscal rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of a million increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of april   partially offset by alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the fiscal rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because of the benefits from ade s foreign sales corporation  state income taxes and various tax credits 
the fiscal rate was higher than the fiscal rate due primarily to the benefit from increased federal and state research and development tax credits primarily realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the impact of increase in the valuation allowance discussed above 
selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which are priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
significant levels of our expenses are fixed in advance and based in part on our expectations as to future revenue 
as a consequence  any material shortfall in revenue in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our earnings

customers may cancel or reschedule shipments 
product shipments could be delayed by production difficulties or critical component inventory shortages 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

marketing and sales expenses can vary from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors  including mix of sales channels  geographic mix and the timing of marketing events 
there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in any future period 
fourth quarter adjustments at april   we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million  as the full value of our net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences may not be realized 
this increase was based upon weighing all evidence available to management 
recording this increase to the valuation allowance decreased our annual effective tax rate to  compared to the estimated annual effective tax rate of utilized during the first three quarters of fiscal also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory by million for ade technologies and million for the semiconductor systems group 
we recorded a million credit to the provision for income taxes during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included a million credit resulting from the difference between our actual effective tax rate for fiscal of and the estimated effective tax rate of utilized during the first three quarters of fiscal also in the fourth quarter of  we reversed accrued bonus expense of million  which had been recorded in the first two quarters of fiscal the difference between our actual effective tax rate and the estimated effective tax rate used in the first three quarters of fiscal resulted primarily from the effect of a million pre tax loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to pre tax income of million for the first three quarters of fiscal also contributing to the difference in the estimated and actual effective tax rates were larger than anticipated federal and state research and development tax credits due in part to expenditures in the fourth quarter the reversal of the accrued bonus expense reflects our cost reduction measures initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal pro forma net income for the nine months ended january   including the reversal of the bonus accrual and utilizing the actual effective tax rate of  is  compared to reported net income for the nine months ended january  of  liquidity and capital resources at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
in addition  we had million in restricted cash used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bond issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency in december we may substitute a letter of credit in an amount equal to approximately of the outstanding principal balance as collateral for our obligations under this bond  assuming we have the ability to borrow under a credit facility 
this substitution would allow the restricted cash balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
we also had an unsecured revolving line of credit facility with a bank  with a maximum borrowing amount of million or a specified percentage of accounts receivable  whichever is less 
the credit facility provided us the option of borrowing at either the bank s prime rate or the bank s libor rate plus 
the credit facility expired and all outstanding amounts thereunder were due december  there were no borrowings outstanding on the date that the credit facility expired 
the company does not intend to renew the credit facility or enter into a new credit facility with another institution at this time 
at april   ade was in violation of certain financial covenants related to the standby letter of credit agreements used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bonds issued through the industrial development authority of the county of pima  arizona in april and the massachusetts industrial finance agency in june we received a waiver of this default as of april  cash used in operating activities for the year ended april  was million 
this amount resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for net non cash charges of million and a million net increase in working capital accounts 
non cash items consisted of million of depreciation and amortization and million as our share of the net loss of affiliated companies  net of cash dividends received from the affiliates  partially offset by a  increase in deferred tax assets 
the net increase in working capital total of million was comprised of increased accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses of million  million and  respectively  and a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred income on sales to japan ade ltd 
jal  our owned japanese affiliate  of million and  million respectively 
these amounts were partially offset by increased accounts payable of million and a decrease in the income tax refund receivable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the significantly increased billings and revenue during the last two quarters of fiscal the increase in inventory resulted primarily from inventory purchases related to a ramp up in production to meet the increase in customer orders 
the increase in prepaid expenses results primarily from the timing of payments 
the decrease in accrued liabilities and other current liabilities resulted from the timing of payments on vendor supplier invoices related to the construction of our tucson  arizona facility 
the decrease in deferred income on sales to japan ade ltd 
is due to the timing of shipments to jal 
the increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from increased inventory purchases related to the ramp up in production as well as the timing of the payables cycle 
the decrease in income tax receivable resulted from receipt of an income tax refund generated by fiscal operating losses 
cash used in investing activities was million  and consisted of million for purchases of fixed assets  million in advances to affiliated companies and an aggregate increase in other assets and restricted cash of million 
cash provided by financing activities was  and consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
this amount was partially offset by  in repayments of long term debt 
we expect to meet our near term working capital needs and capital expenditures primarily through our available cash and cash equivalents 
year impact we have not experienced any problems with our computer systems relating to distinguishing twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates  which generally are referred to as year problems 
we are also not aware of any material year problems with our customers or vendors 
accordingly  we do not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems 
the company previously incurred total costs of approximately  to address year readiness  which included programming  testing and implementing software for year modifications 
these costs were funded through operations
