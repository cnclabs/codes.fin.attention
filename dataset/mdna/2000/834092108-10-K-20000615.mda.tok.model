the decline in net sales was primarily attributable to the north american and rest of world regions 
the sales decline in the north american region primarily the united states resulted from reduced net sales to laboratory customers that were acquired in fiscal by essilor laboratories of america  as well as changes in product mix in fiscal also contributing to the net sales shortfall was softness of the asian  australian and south american economies  although these regions only accounted for approximately of net sales in the aggregate 
south american sales declined by approximately in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal significantly contributing to this decline was the devaluation of the brazilian real in january and the sale of the company s brazilian frame and equipment business during april  which had contributed approximately million of net sales in fiscal higher priced products accounted for approximately of net lens sales in fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal net sales performances by region were as follows north america declined by  europe increased by and rest of world declined by

net interest expense net interest expense totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company repurchased its senior subordinated notes  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company issued senior notes 
the net effect of the above two changes was to reduce fiscal interest rates 
this reduction in interest rates and therefore interest expense was more than offset by an increase in interest expense due to increased borrowing levels in fiscal provision for income taxes the company s combined state  federal and foreign tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal if the special charges are excluded from income before provision for income taxes  and the tax benefit associated with the special charges are excluded from the provision for income taxes  the resulting effective combined state  federal and foreign tax rate would have been

the change in cash flows from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the reduced net income and an increased investment in working capital 
during fiscal  inventories as a percentage of net sales grew to from in the prior year 
as noted in operating expenses above  the company is attempting to reduce inventory levels by transferring high volume production to low cost manufacturing locations  consolidating certain manufacturing expertise into fewer production facilities  and implementing worldwide product standardization 
during fiscal inventories as a percentage of net sales grew to from in the prior year 
the increase in inventories as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of reduced net sales 
net accounts receivable as a percentage of net sales in fiscal remained flat with the prior year at 
net accounts receivable as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the slow down in world economies  particularly in asia and south america contributed to the increase in accounts receivable as a percentage of net sales 
during fiscal net cash expended on investing activities amounted to million 
of this amount  million represented capital expenditures  million related to investment in a joint venture in india and other trade investments  and million was for the acquisition of a wholesale laboratory in portugal in december the most significant capital expenditures in fiscal were made in the united states and europe  primarily related to capacity increases 
subsequent to march  the company acquired the remaining ownership interest in a wholesale laboratory group located in australia and new zealand for million 
during fiscal  net cash expended on investing activities amounted to million 
of this amount million represented capital expenditures and million represented investment in acquisitions 
the most significant capital expenditures  primarily on additional production capacity and computer system upgrades  were made in the united states  mexico  brazil  italy and australia 
management anticipates capital expenditures of million to million annually over the next several years  of which approximately million annually is viewed as discretionary 
financing activities generated million in cash in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily from borrowings on revolving credit facilities 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company repurchased all of its remaining senior subordinated notes due the notes repurchase was funded by borrowings under the company s credit facility 
in conjunction with the repurchase of its senior subordinated notes the company amended its bank credit agreement with the bank of america national trust and savings association  for itself and as agent for a syndicate of other financial institutions amended agreement 
the amended agreement increased the company s multicurrency revolving facility from million to million 
borrowings are divided into two tranches 
tranche a permits borrowings up to million in either us dollars or foreign currencies  to be used for working capital and consummating certain permitted acquisitions 
tranche b permits borrowings of up to million and can be used for working capital purposes  outstanding letters of credit and consummating certain permitted acquisitions 
the tranche a facility matures on october  and the tranche b facility matures on may  among other things the amended agreement changed certain financial covenants  removed the requirement for foreign subsidiary guarantees under the tranche a facility  increased the basket for incurring other unsecured indebtedness to million  and deleted the term facility portion 
borrowings under the tranche a and tranche b revolvers other than swing line loans  which may only be base rate loans may be made as base rate loans or libo rate loans 
base rate loans bear interest at rates per annum equal to the higher of a per annum above the latest federal funds rate  or b the bank of america reference rate 
libo rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the libo rate and a margin varying from to based on the company s leverage ratio 
fixed rate borrowings in foreign currencies bear interest at rates per annum equal to the referenced currency s local ibor plus a margin varying from to based on the company s leverage ratio 
local currency base rate loans are also available at a spread similar to us base rate loans described above 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company issued senior notes notes due  for which the company received approximately million net proceeds  after discounts and issuance expenses 
net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under the amended agreement 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations of the company  limited to million aggregate principal amount at maturity  and will mature on march  the notes will be redeemable  as a whole or from time to time in part  at the option of the company on any date at a redemption price equal to the aggregate principal amount plus a make whole premium 
subsequent to march  the company purchased million of its senior notes due as a result  during the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax of million resulting from the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the purchase price 
the purchase was funded by the company s credit facility and resulted in a decline in net borrowings 
the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain local credit facilities to provide credit for overdraft  working capital and some fixed asset investment purposes 
as of march   the company s total credit available under such facilities was approximately million  of which million had been utilized 
the company continues to have significant liquidity requirements 
in addition to working capital needs and capital expenditures  the company has substantial cash requirements for debt service 
the company expects that the amended agreement and other overseas credit facilities  together with cash on hand and internally generated funds  if available as anticipated  will provide sufficient capital resources to finance the company s operations  fund anticipated capital expenditures  and meet interest requirements on its debt  including the notes  for the foreseeable future 
as the company s debt matures  the company may need to refinance such debt 
the company has the intention  and believes it has the ability  to refinance such debt 
however  there can be no assurance that such debt can be refinanced on terms acceptable to the company 
from time to time  the company may acquire up to million shares of its common stock in open market transactions 
such purchases will be facilitated using a combination of existing cash reserves and cash flow from operations 
any such purchases  and the actual number of shares purchased  will depend upon the availability of shares at acceptable market prices 
any shares of common stock acquired will be held as treasury shares to be issued from time to time under the company s employee stock option program 
currency exchange rates as a result of the company s worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the two principal effects of currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations and financial position are i translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency and ii translation adjustments for subsidiaries in hyper inflationary countries 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have been made to shareholders equity 
for the fiscal years ended march   and such translation adjustments were approximately million  million  and million  respectively  primarily as a result of the strength of the us dollar 
for translation adjustments of the company s subsidiaries operating in hyper inflationary countries  until recently primarily brazil  the functional currency is determined to be the us dollar  and therefore all translation adjustments are reflected in the company s statements of operations 
during january the brazilian real devalued against the us dollar 
by march  the real had deteriorated to against the us dollar  compared to against the us dollar as of december   although it had reached higher than against the us dollar in february at march  the real was compared to the us dollar 
as a result of this devaluation  the company incurred an exchange loss of approximately million fiscal and million in fiscal which were included in the special charges in the statement of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in hyper inflationary environments  the company generally protects margins by methods which include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
because a majority of the company s debt is us dollar denominated  the company may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps however certain currencies  such as the brazilian real  cannot be hedged economically  although no such swaps had been entered into as of march  as of march  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries had entered into forward contracts for intercompany purchase commitments in amounts other than their home currency 
the carrying amount of the forward contracts approximates fair value  which has been estimated based on current exchange rates 
for further financial data of the company s performance by region  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters as a result of lower sales during the holiday season  and fourth quarter results generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect the cost of the goods and services used by the company 
the competitive environment in many markets limits the company s ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and the company is subject to price erosion in many of its standard product lines 
the company seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
for a description of the effects of inflation on the company s reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by the company in response to inflationary conditions see currency exchange rates 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
subsequently the fasb issued sfas no 
which defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the application of the new rules on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance for revenue recognition under certain circumstances 
the accounting and disclosures prescribed by sab will be effective for the first quarter of fiscal year the company believes there will be no material impact resulting from the application of sab in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb this interpretation clarified a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion  b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  to the extent that this interpretation covers events occurring during the period after december   or january  but before the effective date of july   the effects of applying this interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis from july  the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this interpretation 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures 
the company is exposed to market risks inherent in its operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
interest rate risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its existing long term debt and any future financing requirements 
fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on senior notes  and variable rate debt relates primarily to borrowings under the company s bank credit agreement 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates expected on the company s existing long term debt instruments 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of march  expected maturity date as of march  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate debt      weighted average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt    weighted average interest rate currency rate risk 
the company s subsidiaries primarily operate in foreign markets  and predominantly have their local currencies as their functional currencies 
these subsidiaries do not have third party borrowings in currencies other than their local currencies  and therefore there are no appropriate quantitative disclosures 
qualitative disclosures 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 
interest rate risk on variable long term borrowings  
the ability of the company to pay or refinance long term borrowings at maturity at market rates  
the impact of interest rate movements on the company s ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants and 
the impact of interest rate movements on the company s ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations or business acquisitions 
the company manages interest rate risk on its outstanding long term borrowings through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while the company cannot predict its ability to refinance existing debt  or the impact interest rate movements might have on existing debt  management evaluates the company s financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
the company s primary currency rate risk exposures relate to 
the company s decentralized operations  whereby approximately of the company s revenues are derived from operations outside the united states  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  
the ability of the company s us operations to satisfy cash flow requirements of predominantly us dollar denominated long term debt without the need to repatriate into the united states foreign earnings and profits  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries being primarily directly from the us parent  resulting in us dollar investments in foreign currency functional companies and 
the location of the company s operating subsidiaries in a number of countries that have seen significant exchange rate changes against the us dollar  primarily downwards in recent years  such as brazil  mexico  china  venezuela and other asian countries 
the company manages its currency rate risks through a variety of measures 
the company operates on a decentralized regional basis with manufacturing operations located in most major markets 
as a result  individual markets are not necessarily impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
in addition  the company negotiated as part of its bank credit agreement a multicurrency facility so that local borrowings could be made in the currency of the local entity  while still obtaining the benefits of central borrowing capability 
in addition  in certain limited instances  subsidiaries  after obtaining approval from the company s head office  will enter into forward exchange contracts in connection with inter company purchases and sales of products 
these contracts do not extend longer than one year  and are immaterial to the overall operations of the group 
subsidiaries operating in high or hyper inflationary environments protect margins by methods which include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
the company discloses constant exchange rate net sales performances in the aggregate  as well as by region  in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see currency exchange rates

the company has not completed the evaluation of the possible effect of the changes to the euro on foreign currency loans  or the impact if any  on the marketplace implications of a common currency 
preliminary assessments indicate that the financial impact of conversion to a euro based currency will not be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
