total expenses remained relatively unchanged at million of total revenue for year ended december  from million of total revenue for the comparable period in the decrease as a percent of revenue was due to higher revenues in compared to research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of personnel  equipment  and facilities 
research and development expenses increased to million of total revenues for the year ended december  from million of total revenues for the comparable period in the increase in spending was primarily due to the cost associated with the hiring and retaining of engineering personnel

under sfas no 
 the company cannot recognize a deferred tax asset for the future benefit of its tax loss carryforward unless it concludes that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax asset would be realized 
accordingly  the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax asset to the extent that it cannot demonstrate that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
in determining the amount of valuation allowance required  the company considers numerous factors  including historical profitability  estimated future taxable income  the volatility of its historical earnings and of the industry in which it operates  and its assessment of the likelihood that the deferred tax asset derived from its net operating losses will be realized in the carryforward period

international revenues accounted for and of total revenue in and  respectively 
product 
product revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in product revenues reflects  in large part  decreased demand for the company s products in the asia pacific region and in the petrochemical industry where low oil prices have resulted in tighter budgets and delayed purchase decisions 
the company has historically derived a significant percentage of its revenue from the petrochemical industry 
also contributing to decreased revenue was the decision made by some customers and prospective customers to address yk issues  resources that might otherwise have been used to develop and deploy g based solutions 
service 
service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in  an increase of 
the increase in service revenues was primarily due to an increase in application consulting revenues and  to a lesser extent  increased maintenance fees derived from an increased customer base  partially offset by a decrease in educational services 
maintenance revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in  an increase of 
consulting fees increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in  an increase of 
fees for educational services decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in  a decrease of 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in consulting labor costs 
gross margin on revenues increased to for the year ended december  from in the same period in the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from improved utilization of consulting personnel coupled with higher consulting revenues and lower product distribution costs 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in  a decrease of  due principally to cost reduction measures that were implemented in such reductions included a reduction in staff as well as reduced facilities and related costs 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expenses decreased to million of total revenues from million of total revenues for the comparable period in the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing personnel and the closing and consolidation of several field sales offices 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million of total revenues for the year ended december  from million of total revenues for the comparable period in the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction in personnel  the consolidation of headquarter facilities  and other actions taken in connection with the company s restructuring implemented in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million of total revenues for the year ended december  from million of total revenues for the comparable period in the decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to a reduction in personnel  the consolidation of headquarters facilities  and other actions taken in connections with the company s restructuring plan implemented in restructuring charge 
in june  the company implemented a plan of restructuring intended to lower operating expenses in subsequent periods by reducing its workforce by approximately  closing and consolidating several field sales offices  and consolidating office space in its corporate headquarters 
accordingly  the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the quarter ended june  in  no provision for a restructuring charge was made 
as of june   the company had taken actions in all intended areas consistent with its restructuring plan of june and had substantially completed that plan 
other income for the year ended december   other income decreased to  from  for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to the company s recording of a one time benefit in relating to the recovery of its interest in a joint venture 
the reduction was partially offset by an increase in investment income from  in to  in income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision in both years represents income taxes on income generated in foreign jurisdictions 
the company generated a significant tax loss carryforward during the years ended december  and selected quarterly operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
because the company ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders for software products 
accordingly  revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders for software products booked in the quarter 
the revenues for a quarter typically include a number of large orders 
if the timing of any of these orders is delayed  it could result in a substantial reduction in revenues for that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has come from license contracts that have been effected in the final weeks of that quarter 
since the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any revenue shortfalls would likely have a disproportionate adverse effect on net income 
the following tables present unaudited financial information for the company s eight most recent quarters 
the following selected quarterly information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation 
the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

the company s lease commitments consist of operating leases primarily for the company s facilities and computer equipment 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
the company regularly invests excess funds in highly rated money market funds  government securities  and commercial paper 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at december  to million at december  cash used for operations in was million million was used for the funding of the company s operating loss  million was used to fund accounts receivables  million was provided by depreciation and amortization expense  and million was provided by an increase in accrued liabilities 
cash used for investing activities in was million million was used to purchase short term investments and  was used to purchase equipment and other assets 
cash used in financing activities was   was used to purchase treasury stock  partially offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
cash decreased  in due to the effect of currency fluctuation 
the company believes that its available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s business requirements at least through december  stock repurchase program in the third quarter of  the company began a program to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock on the open market 
as of december    shares had been repurchased at a cost of  there has been no repurchase of shares since march  year disclosure many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with these year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
to date  the company has not experienced any material year problems in its computer systems or operations 
however  other companies  including gensym  could experience latent year problems 
the company developed a phased year readiness plan for the current versions of its products 
the plan included development of corporate awareness  assessment  implementation including remediation  upgrading and replacement of certain product versions  validation testing  and contingency planning 
to date  the company has experienced no problems related to year compliance 
the company has defined year compliant as the ability to i correctly handle date information needed for the december  to january  date change  ii function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the advent of a new century  assuming correct configuration  iii where appropriate  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined  and predetermined manner  iv if the date elements in interfaces and data storage specify the century  store and provide output of date information in ways that are unambiguous as to century  and v recognize year as a leap year 
the company has not tested its products on all platforms or all versions of operating systems that it currently supports and has advised its customers to verify that their platforms and operating systems support the transition to the year the company completed a review and assessment of its products and  with the exception of the products discussed below  the company believes that its current products are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s products contain and will contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  including isvs  end users and distributors  to be year compliant 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company 
while the company believes that current versions of its products are year compliant  other factors may result in an application created using the company s products not being year compliant 
some of these factors include improper programming techniques used by customers or third parties in creating the application or non compliance of the underlying hardware  operating system  or software on which the application runs 
known or unknown errors or defects in the company s products could result in delay or loss of revenue  diversion of development resources  damage to the company s reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
some commentators have predicted significant litigation regarding year compliance issues  and the company is aware of such lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
testing has revealed that in versions of g prior to rev 
 a specific g system procedure and the use of two digit years in the built in displays are not year compliant 
these problems were fixed in g rev 
released in june to date  the company has not incurred any material expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
most of its expenses have related to  and are expected to continue to relate to  the operating costs associated with time spent by employees in the evaluation process and year compliance matters generally 
at this time  the company does not possess the information necessary to estimate the potential costs of revisions to its proprietary software should any revisions be required or the replacement of third party software  hardware or services that are determined not to be year compliant 
although the company does not anticipate that these expenses will be material  such expenses  if higher than anticipated  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  the company has not experienced  and is not currently aware of any year compliance problems relating to its proprietary software or its it or non it systems that would have a material adverse effect on the company without taking into account its efforts to avoid or fix such problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not discover year compliance problems in its proprietary software that will require substantial revisions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third party software  hardware or services incorporated into its material it and non it systems will not need to be revised or replaced  all of which could be time consuming and expensive 
in the event of any year problems  the company s contingency plan included the following components 
deploying all necessary internal resources to tackle the issues as swiftly as possible  
calling upon the company s relationships with its commercial partners  to enable suitable escalation of issues with any third party  and 
calling upon technical assistance from the company s technology partners 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will not be the subject of lawsuits regarding the failure of the company s products former or present in the event they are not year compliant 
despite the testing and remediation efforts undertaken by the company  the company s products may contain errors or defects associated with the year known or unknown errors or defects in the company s products could result in delay or loss of revenue  diversion of development resources  damage to the company s reputation or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  because the computer system in which the company s products are used involve different hardware  software and firmware components from different manufacturers  it may be difficult to determine which component in a system caused a year issue 
as a result  the company may be subjected to year related lawsuits independent of whether its products are year compliant 
any year related suits  if adversely determined  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the aicpa issued statement of position  modification of sop software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop requires use of the residual method of recognition of revenues when vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but does not exists for delivered elements of a software arrangement 
the company will be required to comply with the provisions of sop for applicable transactions entered into beginning january  the company does not expect the adoption of sop will have a material effect on its financial position or operating results 
certain factors that may affect future results a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s operating results  including  without limitation  the following emerging market for intelligent operations management systems 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from the licensing and support of software products that enable organizations to implement intelligent operations management systems for decision support and control 
although many organizations have begun to deploy  or have announced plans to deploy  intelligent operations management systems  these systems are different from the basic monitoring and control systems that are traditionally employed by these organizations 
there can be no assurance that these organizations will be able to introduce intelligent operations management systems successfully  nor that such systems will gain widespread acceptance 
in addition  the timing of the implementation of intelligent operations management systems by organizations may be affected by economic factors  government regulations  and other factors 
delays in the introduction of intelligent operations management systems or the failure of these systems to gain widespread market acceptance would materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in addition  the company believes that end users in its markets are increasingly seeking application specific products and components as well as complete solutions  rather than general software tools with which to develop application specific functionality and solutions 
meeting this demand has required the company to modify its sales approach 
the company is also increasingly reliant on value added resellers and systems integrators to satisfy market requirements 
the modified sales approach may also lengthen the company s average sales cycle 
failure by the company to respond appropriately to shifts in market demand could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
dependence upon development of sales and marketing force 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon the productivity of its sales and marketing personnel and the ability of the company to continue to attract  integrate  train  motivate and retain new sales and marketing personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company s investment in sales and marketing will ultimately prove to be successful 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s sales and marketing personnel will be able to compete successfully against the significantly more extensive and better funded sales and marketing operations of many of the company s current and potential competitors 
the company s inability to manage its sales and marketing personnel effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
variability of quarterly operating results 
the company has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
the company has  on occasion  recorded quarterly losses  and there can be no assurance that revenue growth or profitable operations can be attained on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s sales cycle typically ranges from six to months  and the cost of acquiring the company s software  building and deploying applications  and training users represents a significant expenditure for customers 
the company s relatively long sales cycle and high license fees  together with fixed short term expenses  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  based on a relatively small variation in the timing of major orders 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades and the timing of significant orders could contribute to this quarterly variability 
in addition  the company ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order and typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
therefore  revenues from software licenses in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
historically  a majority of each quarter s revenues from software licenses has come from license contracts that have been effected in the final weeks of that quarter 
the revenues for a quarter typically include a number of large orders 
if the timing of any of these orders is delayed  it could result in a substantial reduction in revenues for that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels 
a shortfall in expected revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
the company s financial performance has generally been somewhat weaker in the first quarter than in the other fiscal quarters  due to customer purchasing patterns 
economic factors 
because capital expenditures are often viewed as discretionary by organizations  sales of the company s products for capital budget projects are subject to general economic conditions 
future recessionary conditions in the industries which use the company s products may adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
product concentration 
the company s main product offerings are g  an object oriented development and deployment environment for building intelligent operations management systems  and software application products which operate in conjunction with g accordingly  the company s business and financial results are substantially dependent upon the continued customer acceptance and deployment of g and related products 
the timing of major g releases may affect the timing of purchases of the company s products 
the company has introduced several g based products for building applications and is developing others 
the company believes that market acceptance of these products will be important to the company s future growth 
there can be no assurance that such products will achieve market acceptance or that new products will be successfully developed 
in addition  the company relies on many of its marketing partners to develop g based products for specialized markets 
accordingly  the company s business and financial results are also linked to the continued successful product development by its marketing partners and market acceptance of such g based products 
any decline in the demand for g and related products  whether as a result of competitive products  price competition  the lack of success of the company s marketing partners  technological change  the shift in customer demand toward complete solutions  or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
new products and rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is relatively new and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products and features to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards  and to manage transitions from one product release to the next 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in introducing new products and product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and product enhancements 
there also can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products  that the company will successfully manage the transition to future versions of g  or to successor technology  or that the company s future products will achieve market acceptance 
in addition  the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products and products currently under development obsolete and unmarketable 
from time to time  new products  capabilities  or technologies may be announced that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
there can be no assurance that announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings will not cause customers to defer purchasing existing company products 
see emerging market for intelligent operations management systems 
migration to microsoft windows and object exchange standards 
the company believes that client user interfaces compliant with microsoft windows and motif are increasingly the preferred choice of its customers 
in order to gain wider customer penetration  the company must respond to this market choice 
accordingly  the company has developed and achieved initial commercial release of a client access product that is microsoft windows and motif compliant 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in further developing and marketing this new product 
any delay or failure to meet market expectations with this product could affect the company s competitive position or limit its growth opportunities 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and risks associated with strategic partner relationships 
the company sells its products in part through value added resellers  systems integrators  oems and distributors  which are not under the control of the company 
sales of the company s products by value added resellers and systems integrators represented   and of the company s product revenues in the first nine months of   and  respectively 
the loss of major oems or resellers of the company s products  a significant decline in their sales  or difficulty on the part of such third party developers or resellers in developing successful g based products and applications could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain additional qualified third party resellers  or that third party resellers will be able to effectively sell and implement the company s products 
in addition  the company relies on third party resellers to provide post sales service and support to its customers  and any deficiencies in such service and support could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
concentration of credit risk 
for the fiscal year ended december   sales to one customer  bmc software  accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue 
as a result  the loss of bmc as a customer could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
no single customer accounted for greater than of total revenues or represented a significant credit risk to the company in or no single customer accounted for greater than of accounts receivable at december  or risks associated with international operations 
the company s international revenues represented   and  of total revenues in   and  respectively 
revenues are categorized by the company according to product shipment destination and therefore do not necessarily reflect the ultimate country of installation 
the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including difficulties in building and managing international operations  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into local languages  fluctuations in the value of international currencies including the euro  fluctuating import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
in particular  the continuing economic problems in asia pose challenges to the company s sales and marketing operations in that region 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
competition 
although the company believes that there are no other commercially available products that offer the full range of high level capabilities embodied in the company s products  a number of companies offer products that perform certain functions of g for specific applications 
in all of the company s markets  there is competition from point solutions  real time and expert system products  and internally developed software 
at the fundamental level  there are commercially available software development tools that software application developers or potential customers could use to build software having functionality similar to the company s products 
certain companies such as objective systems integrators  inc  micromuse  and systems management arts smarts  sell point solutions that compete with the company s products with respect to specific applications or uses 
several companies  including ilog sa and system management arts  offer products with limited real time  expert system  or fault isolation capabilities at lower price points than those provided by the company 
these products often require extensive programming with languages such as c or c for complete implementation 
although the company believes that these products offer a less productive development environment than g and that they lack the comprehensive capabilities of g based products  certain competitors in this category have greater financial and other resources than the company and might introduce new or improved products to compete with g  possibly at lower prices 
the company s software is also integrated into industry specific solutions by value added resellers 
a number of software companies offer products that compete in specific application areas addressed by these value added resellers  such as cement kiln control and refinery scheduling  and they could be successful in supplying alternatives to products based on the company s software 
many of the company s customers have significant investments in their existing solutions and have the resources necessary to enhance existing products and to develop future products 
these customers may develop and incorporate competing technologies into their systems or may outsource responsibility for such systems to others who do not use the company s products 
there is no assurance that the company can successfully persuade development personnel within these customers organizations to use g based products that can cost effectively compete with their internally developed products 
this would reduce the need for the company s products and services and limit future opportunities for the company 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development and sales and marketing will be required to maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop products or provide services that are superior to the company s products or services or achieve greater market acceptance 
competitive pressures faced by the company could force the company to reduce its prices  which could result in reduced profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
potential for undetected errors 
complex software products such as those offered by the company may contain unintended errors or failures commonly referred to as bugs 
there can be no assurance that  despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any such errors or defects to date  there can be no assurance that errors or defects will not be discovered in the future that could cause delays in product introduction and shipments or require design modifications that could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
dependence upon proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  contract  copyright  patent  and trademark law to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology 
the company enters into confidentiality and or license agreements with its employees  third party resellers  and end users and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
in addition  the company has placed technical inhibitors in its software that prevent such software from running on unauthorized computers 
however  effective patent  copyright  and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which the company s products are distributed 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties  or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future or that such claims will not be successful 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part upon certain key employees  including its executive officers  the loss of any of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s key employees are not bound by employment agreements that require them to remain with the company 
the company s success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  technical  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  or that new key personnel will integrate successfully into the senior management team 
the loss of certain key employees or the company s inability to attract and retain other qualified employees or to adequately replace key personnel who depart the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
year compliance
