the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
revenues have historically increased at higher rates in the fourth quarter of the year and at lower rates in the next succeeding quarter  except for the fourth quarter of discussed below 
the company believes such seasonality is due to a number of factors  including the company s quota based compensation arrangements  typical of those used in software companies  and year end budgetary pressures on the company s customers 
the company believes revenues for the fourth quarter of were not consistent with the historical trend previously discussed principally as a result of a delay in closing year end license business due to companies unique focus on their year issues 
excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of  the company believes that the seasonal trend that the company has experienced in the past may continue in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the ipo  the company historically funded operations primarily through the sale of private equity securities and  to a lesser extent  equipment financing and borrowing arrangements 
in june  the company completed the ipo which resulted in net proceeds to the company totaling million 
as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  reflecting a net decrease of million since december  working capital as of december  was million as compared to a working capital of million as of december  the consistent balance of working capital at december  relative to the prior year includes a decrease in cash and cash equivalents principally to fund operations and an increase in accounts receivable at december  primarily resulting from the timing of sales generated during the fourth calendar quarter 
net cash used in operating activities was million for as compared to million for the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to improved operating results and an increase in accounts receivable collections 
net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million for the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to certain leasehold improvements made to the company s new headquarters  the lease for which commenced in july  and additional equipment purchases 
in addition  the company financed less new equipment in as compared to the prior year 
net cash used by financing activities was million for as compared to net cash provided by financing of million for the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the ipo in june partially offset by principal payments made under the line of credit agreements 
financing activities in primarily relate to capital lease obligations partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises 
the company has a working capital revolving line of credit the credit facility with a bank  which is secured by the company s accounts receivable and bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus per annum 
the amount available under the credit facility is limited to the lesser of of the company s eligible accounts receivable  as defined  or million 
the credit facility will expire on december  at december   there was no amount outstanding under the credit facility 
the net proceeds from the ipo  after deducting million in underwriting discounts  commissions and other costs associated with the offering  were million 
a portion of the net proceeds from the ipo in the amount of million was used to pay down the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
the balance of the credit facility was paid with cash generated from operations in june the balance of the remaining net proceeds from the ipo in the amount of million as of december  is available for future working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the company may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
although the company may periodically review potential acquisition opportunities  there are no current agreements with respect to any such transactions 
the company believes that cash and cash equivalents  remaining net proceeds from the ipo  cash generated from operations  and available borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next months 
seasonality the company has experienced  and may experience in the future  significant seasonality in its business 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be affected by such trends in the future 
revenues have historically increased at higher rates in the fourth quarter of the year and at lower rates in the next succeeding quarter  except for the fourth quarter of discussed below 
the company believes such seasonality is due to a number of factors  including the company s quota based compensation arrangements  typical of those used in software companies  and year end budgetary pressures on the company s customers 
the company believes revenues for the fourth quarter of were not consistent with the historical trend previously discussed principally as a result of a delay in closing year end license business due to companies unique focus on their year issues 
excluding the impact of the fourth quarter of  the company believes that the seasonal trend that the company has experienced in the past may continue in the foreseeable future 
quarterly fluctuations the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  increased expenses especially as they relate to product development and sales and marketing  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of revenues  announcements of new products by the company or its competitors and capital spending patterns of the company s customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels based upon its expectations as to future revenues  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
a drop in near term demand for the company s products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
the company achieved net profitability for however  as a result of the factors described above  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
the company believes that  due to the underlying factors for quarterly fluctuations  period to period comparisons of its operations are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the year issue overview like other businesses dependent upon computerized information processing  the company has dealt with and must continue to deal with the year issues  which stem from using two digits to reflect the year in many computer programs and data 
because certain computers and computer applications define dates by the last two digits of the year  or other two digit dates after the year may not be properly identified as the year or the appropriate later year  but rather the year or a year between and as the case may be 
this error could result in the inaccurate processing of certain date based information  which could cause a variety of operational problems for businesses 
impact of year issue the company believes it has addressed the year issues in its proprietary software products and  to its knowledge  has not encountered any material business interruptions associated with these applications  including third party software currently embedded in the company s proprietary software  for its existing clients 
as the year progresses  the company will continually monitor the impact  if any  of the year issues and address them accordingly 
the company did not experience any material year computer problems with respect to its internal technology systems and non information technology systems  principally as a result of successful verification testing of the systems and remediation work completed during the company s internal technology systems include telecommunications  computer hardware and software 
non information technology systems typically include embedded technology such as security systems  elevators and other systems which contain an embedded computer or computer like device used to control the operation of plant  machinery and equipment 
the company estimates the total costs associated with the year issue principally in connection with the use of outside consultants to be negligible during with the majority of remediation costs  aside from new equipment purchases  attributable to internal costs 
new equipment purchases were deemed to be in the normal course of business 
historically  the company has not separately tracked the internal costs related to year compliance 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs for the company s information systems employees 
the company s current software products have received recognition as being developed using best practices for addressing year issues by the information technology association of america 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s software products contain all necessary date code changes 
the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its operations as a result of year issues of its major suppliers or customers as of this report date 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its customers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unique nature of such potential litigation  it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
recent accounting statements sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 
sfas were issued in june and june respectively 
they are effective for the company s fiscal year ending december  these pronouncements establish accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
the company believes that the adoption of sfas and sfas will not have a material impact on its financial statements as it has not entered into derivative contracts or hedging activities and has no current plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants acsec issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop establishes criteria for determining which costs of developing or obtaining internal use computer software should be charged to expense and which should be capitalized 
the company adopted sop effective january  the company s adoption of sop did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

uncertainties that are either non financial or non quantifiable  such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of the company s market risks 
interest rates 
cash equivalents consist of money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months 
interest on the credit facility is based on libor plus per annum

changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on cash equivalents 
as of december  and the date of this form k  there was no amount outstanding under the credit facility  therefore  changes in interest rates are not applicable for either interest expense or fair market value of the debt instrument
