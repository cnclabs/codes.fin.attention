item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s three basic businesses white paper  brown paper and building materials are affected by changes in general economic conditions 
white and brown paper sales and earnings tend to follow the general economy 
the sales and earnings of the building materials business are closely related to new housing starts  remodeling activity and the availability and terms of financing for construction 
all industry segments are influenced by global economic factors of supply and demand 
in addition  the costs of wood and recycled fiber  basic raw materials for the company s three segments  are sensitive to various supply and demand factors including environmental issues 
results of operations vs 
consolidated net sales increased and operating earnings increased in compared to improved performances from all three segments contributed to the increase over the prior year 
also contributing to the improvement in earnings was a change in estimate for the depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
the change was based on a study performed by the company s engineering department  comparisons to typical industry practices and the effect of the company s extensive capital investments which have resulted in a mix of assets with longer productive lives due to technological advances 
the change in estimate increased operating earnings by million and net income by million  or per diluted share 
white paper struggled in the early part of as markets continued to be depressed from the asian turmoil of however  by the third quarter markets were rebounding and the upswing continued into the fourth quarter 
net sales increased and operating earnings were up before the effect of the depreciation change when compared to the prior year 
the improvement was due to increased unit shipments which offset average sales price declines 
forms shipments increased as a result of increasing market share 
cut sheet volumes improved primarily due to a continued focus on sales to office superstores 
additionally  included a full year of operation from the brownsville  tennessee  cut sheet plant  which came on line in february  and a new cut sheet plant in washington court house  ohio  which came on line in november hardwood market pulp unit shipments increased as the company was able to take advantage of pulp markets in while unit shipments were strong in  average sales prices remained below levels 
continuous forms average sales prices declined  cut sheets and fine paper  
the only product line to exceed levels was hardwood market pulp  which increased 
while prices were down year over year  third and fourth quarter trends were positive 
as a result  fourth quarter average sales prices were above yearly averages 
raw material costs slightly reduced operating margins during the period as chip costs increased over the gross profit margin for white paper increased to in from in brown paper sales and earnings were solid throughout  as we once again out performed the industry in percentage of volume growth for the year 
net sales increased and earnings increased before the effects of the depreciation change compared to unit shipments for corrugated containers improved and grocery bags increased over levels 
the increased volume in corrugated containers resulted from additional converting capacity from capital improvements and strong demand from our expanding customer base 
bag unit shipments increased for the first time since due to the continued growth of the handle bag  which is recapturing market share from plastics 
average sales prices increased for all product lines in  corrugated containers were up and grocery bags were up over the prior year 
raw material costs reduced brown paper earnings as old corrugated container occ prices increased from levels 
the gross profit margin for brown paper was in compared to in building materials posted a strong year in as net sales improved and operating earnings increased before the effect of the depreciation change compared to average sales prices were up in every product line in except for our international products 
oriented strand board osb showed the greatest improvement as average sales prices increased over other product lines showed increases of for plywood  for lumber  for particleboard and for domestic medium density fiberboard mdf 
the only decline in sales price realizations came from the international mdf line  which experienced a decline of 
unit shipments increased in as demand remained strong 
plywood improved and osb increased 
the increased plywood volume partially resulted from a full year of production at the zwolle  louisiana  plant which closed for six months in due to fire damage 
lumber shipments were strong as well  improving over levels 
volume increases were the result of a strong us housing market through late fall and a full year of operation at a new small log sawmill in taylor  louisiana 
the company s composite panel markets also saw growth in  as particleboard increased and mdf increased 
these improvements were the result of the acquisition of an mdf plant in morcenx  france in march and a particleboard plant in linxe  france in june as a result of the favorable price and volume changes  the gross profit margin for building materials increased significantly to in from in selling and administrative expenses increased million or in due to the continued expansion of company operations 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in other income expense of million was primarily related to the reserve set up to approximate potential non tax deductible penalties from a federal clean air act assessment 
interest expense decreased million or in to million 
the reduction occurred despite a decrease in capitalized interest to million from million in interest expense declined as a result of reducing total debt in by million 
the company s effective interest rate increased to from in the prior year 
results of operations vs 
consolidated net sales increased and operating earnings improved in compared to a strong performance from the brown paper segment and increases in unit shipments for many product lines contributed to the results 
white paper net sales improved over the prior year as increases in unit shipments more than offset decreases in average sales prices 
while sales were up compared to  operating earnings declined in  primarily as a result of pricing pressures on market pulp and fine paper 
average sales prices for cut sheet and continuous forms showed slight increases over the prior year  while hardwood market pulp and fine paper declined and  respectively  from the price decline resulted from difficulties in asian economies 
also negatively affecting white paper results were increased chip costs of and start up costs for the new paper machine at kentucky mills in white paper unit shipments were mixed in as cut sheets increased while continuous forms decreased 
the increased cut sheet volume was the result of our new brownsville  tennessee  cut sheet plant which came on line in february hardwood market pulp decreased while fine paper unit shipments increased 
the fine paper improvement was the result of our new kentucky paper machine 
brown paper was the top performing segment in as operating earnings improved when compared to net sales increased as average sales prices improved for corrugated containers and for grocery bags over the prior year 
unit shipment fluctuations also played a significant role in increasing sales and earnings in as corrugated container unit shipments improved over the prior year  while grocery bag unit shipments declined 
approximately of the improvement in corrugated container shipments was due to increased internal converting capacity from capital projects 
the remainder of the increase was a result of a full year of operation at a box plant in plant city  florida  and a sheet plant in portland  oregon  both of which came on line in the second quarter of raw material costs had a positive impact on operating earnings during as occ costs declined from the prior year 
building materials operating earnings decreased in and net sales dropped slightly from the prior year  as average sales prices declined for most products 
lumber reflected the most dramatic erosion as average sales prices dropped 
other price declines included in particleboard and in mdf 
the difficulties in asian economies created supply and demand imbalances  keeping prices depressed for these products in the pricing exception in was osb  which realized a price increase of over the prior year 
while prices declined for most product lines  strong housing starts and low interest rates helped fuel unit shipment increases for most product lines in lumber was the primary benefactor as unit shipments improved over the prior year 
in addition  the start up of our new small log sawmill in taylor  louisiana  in august and other capital project completions helped increase unit shipments 
other unit shipment improvements included particleboard of and mdf of over the prior year 
mdf shipments increased due to capital projects and the acquisition of a facility in morcenx  france in march decreased plywood shipments of were the result of the closure of the taylor  louisiana  mill in july  and downtime at our zwolle  louisiana  mill due to a fire that halted production in april selling and administrative expenses increased in due to assimilation of acquisitions and expansions during the year 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales  however  declined to for compared to for interest expense was million in compared to million in  a increase 
the weighted average interest rate remained stable at in both years 
the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of million in average outstanding debt and a decrease in capitalized interest to million in from million in  resulting from the completion of the kentucky expansion in june liquidity and capital resources willamette generates funds internally via net earnings adjusted for non cash charges against earnings such as depreciation  amortization  cost of fee timber harvested and deferred income taxes 
funds generated externally have usually been through debt financing 
in  cash flows from operating activities were million compared to million in  an increase of 
the improvement was primarily achieved through increased earnings 
internally generated cash flows funded all of the company s capital expenditure program in excess cash from operations was used to pay dividends and reduce debt outstanding by million during the year 
net working capital increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase was mainly due to increases in receivables and inventories 
the company is continually making capital expenditures at its manufacturing facilities to improve fiber utilization  achieve labor efficiency and to expand production 
in  the company incurred million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
during the following major capital projects were completed upgrade of the paper machine at johnsonburg  pennsylvania 
construction of a new cut sheet plant in washington court house  ohio 
expansion of secondary fiber capacity at the paper mill in campti  louisiana 
major capital projects underway at december   include construction and installation of a new recovery boiler and steam turbine generator at the albany  oregon  paper mill 
construction of a new corrugated box plant in phoenix  arizona 
relocation of the elk grove  illinois  corrugated facility 
installation of a steam turbine generator at kentucky mills 
upgrade of the paper machine at johnsonburg  pennsylvania 
construction of a new particleboard plant near bennettsville  south carolina 
construction of a new small log sawmill near chester  south carolina 
capacity increase at our particleboard plant in linxe  france 
the cost of all major projects in progress at december   is estimated to be approximately million  of which million has already been spent 
these projects will be funded with internally generated cash flows and external borrowings if needed 
in december  the company sold  acres of southwest washington timberland for million 
the company acquired the land in as part of the purchase of cavenham forest industries 
the forestlands were sold as they were not critical to the long term fiber supply needs of the company s operations 
proceeds of the sale were used to pay down debt during in june  the company initiated a medium term note program and issued million of notes as of december  the medium term notes carry interest rates ranging from to and maturities from to years 
in addition  in january  the company issued million in debentures million at due and million at due proceeds from both issuances were used to replace notes maturing in and reduce other bank borrowing 
the total debt to capital ratio declined to at december   from at december   representing a debt reduction of million 
the company believes it has the resources available to meet its long term liquidity requirements 
resources include internally generated funds and borrowing agreements 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of the company s common stock 
the company repurchased  shares for million during the third and fourth quarters of on april   the company s board of directors voted to raise the quarterly cash dividend from to per share  which was a increase  however  there is no assurance as to future dividends as they depend on earnings  capital requirements and financial condition 
other matters the company believes it is in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality 
in early  the us environmental protection agency epa released the final rules regarding air and water quality known as the cluster rules 
compliance with the cluster rules is required by  however  certain exceptions to the rules extend the time period for specific compliance requirements up to eight years from adoption 
the company  through previously completed and future projects  has made significant progress toward upgrading the mills and plans to have all mills in compliance with the cluster rules by the required deadlines 
the company s other operations are faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
in the fourth quarter of  the company received a series of requests for information from the epa under section of the clean air act the act with respect to the company s building materials operations 
the requests have focused on compliance with regulations under the prevention of significant deterioration psd program under the act 
on may   the epa issued a notice of violation nov alleging violations of the act and related state regulations  and on december   issued a second nov supplementing and clarifying the first nov 
the company has responded to the allegations and has had many meetings and extensive correspondence with the epa and the us department of justice to negotiate a resolution of the issues raised by the novs 
settlements by other companies in the wood products industry that have received novs under the act have involved the payment of substantial penalties and agreements to install emission control equipment and undertake supplemental environmental projects 
the company has established a million reserve as an estimate of the potential non tax deductible penalties resulting from these proceedings 
in november  the company received from the epa a request for information under section of the act requesting information with respect to the company s johnsonburg  pennsylvania  pulp and paper mill 
this request also focused on compliance with psd regulations 
subsequently  on april   the company received an nov relating to its johnsonburg mill 
the nov asserts violations of the act relating to two alleged major modifications to the plant  allegedly without proper psd permits and without complying with applicable psd requirements 
the company is reviewing the allegations contained in this nov and has been meeting with federal and state officials to discuss the issues raised by the nov 
in august  the company received another section information request from the epa relating to the company s paper mill in campti  louisiana 
also  in march and november  the company received section information requests from the epa relating to the company s paper mill in hawesville  kentucky 
based upon either enacted or proposed regulations  the company estimates that over the next five years  additional capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will not exceed million 
although future environmental capital expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty because of continuing changes in laws  the company believes that compliance with such environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position 
in  the company began addressing the possible effects of the yk issue on its information  financial and manufacturing systems 
these efforts included inventory assessment  modification and testing of these key systems 
modification  testing and implementation of all critical systems was completed early in the fourth quarter of with the passing of january   the company has experienced no significant yk problems 
as of december   the company had spent million on yk compliance 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
no further significant expenditures are expected 
over the years  inflation has resulted in replacement costs higher than those originally needed to purchase existing plant and equipment 
advances in technology and environmental concerns also contribute to higher costs 
productivity gains because of technological improvements may partially offset these increased costs 
our use of lifo to value inventories allows us to include these inflationary costs in the cost of sales
