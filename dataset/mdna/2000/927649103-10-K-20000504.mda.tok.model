on march   the company  formerly named agri nutrition group limited  merged with virbac  inc  with the company being the surviving corporation 
virbac sa  the parent of virbac  inc  received of the voting equity of the company  therefore  virbac  inc is considered to be the acquirer for financial statement purposes

under the plan  which was completed prior to the end of the year  all pet product distribution operations have been transferred from agnu s chicago  illinois  and los angeles  california facilities to the company s larger fort worth  texas facility 
all manufacturing and distribution operations which had been carried out at the chicago facility ceased  and such operations have been transferred to other existing company facilities

the management s discussion and analysis that follows contains forward looking information made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements may be affected by certain risks and uncertainties described in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
projections of gross margin improvements anticipated due to the consolidation of manufacturing and distribution facilities and of expense reductions that should result from actual or planned headcount reductions may not be achieved if management is not vigilant in executing its plans or if assumptions made in the plans are inaccurate

for the year ended december  as compared to december   the acquisition accounts for approximately of the increase in revenues  approximately of the increase in gross profit and all of the increase in operating expenses 
for comparative purposes  management believes that an as adjusted analysis upon which results are presented on a basis that is equivalent to will provide a more meaningful discussion of the results of operations 
to that end  the actual results for the period ending december  have been adjusted to include the results of agri nutrition since march in order to be comparable with the actual results of the as adjusted amounts have also been adjusted to reflect the effects of the merger  primarily adjustments to reduce interest expense reflecting the repayment of debt in conjunction with the merger and adjustments to depreciation and amortization related to certain purchase accounting adjustments 
management believes the amounts and discussion below provide a more meaningful comparison of the company s results of operations

sales of million in increased million or compared to the prior year 
positive factors impacting sales were o increased volumes of the company s preventicr tick collar 
o the introduction of advanced formula and patent protected spherulites to the company s dermatological line  which management believes have led to an increase in market share in the dermatological line 
o increased volumes of bromethalin tm rodenticides 
these positive factors were partially offset by the following negative factors o a disruption to the dental line s marketing efforts caused by the relocation of the line s marketing staff from california to texas  this relocation is now complete and is not expected to have an adverse impact on future sales 
o increased competition in the otc distribution channel  particularly for the insecticides 
o a shift in the company s focus in the product lines sold through the otc distribution channel 
as the company integrates the francodex business of virbac  inc with the st 
jon business of agri nutrition  it is focusing on the more profitable products as it eliminates duplication  thus impacting sales 
o distribution disruptions in the fourth quarter caused by the consolidation of the company s production and distribution facilities in california and illinois into its fort worth facility 
the increase in gross profit percentage in compared to in primarily reflects fixed overhead charges being absorbed by higher sales 
somewhat offsetting the positive impact of the increased sales were approximately  of inventory write offs taken in conjunction with the consolidation of the company s production and distribution facilities during the fourth quarter 
these write offs reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately percentage points 
the company s operating expenses of million decreased million in compared to operating expenses include expenses incurred related to sales and marketing  research and development  warehouse and distribution  as well as general and administrative costs 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to actions taken by agri nutrition in to reduce costs and to cost cutting measures taken in the second quarter by the company to consolidate certain commercial and administrative functions 
these measures include a reduction in commercial and administrative personnel that reduced related costs 
partially offsetting these expense reductions were expected increases in variable costs related to the increase in sales as discussed above  and approximately million of non recurring expenses incurred in connection with the operations of virbac  inc  including certain severance payments to virbac  inc employees  including the former president of the company 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses decreased from of sales in to in  reflecting the cost reductions discussed above 
the company did not record an income tax benefit in connection with its operating loss in  nor in the aggregate amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at december  was approximately million 
this valuation allowance reflects management s view that it is more likely than not that tax benefits related to the company s deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the primary factor affecting managements view in this regard is the company s losses from operations in prior years 
net loss in of million improved by million compared to the net loss in based on the various factors described above 
fourth quarter results the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  for the fourth quarter of the results for the fourth quarter were adversely affected by inventory write offs  lower sales  and costs associated with the consolidation of the company s production and distribution facilities during the fourth quarter 
the company wrote off approximately  of inventory in conjunction with the consolidation 
revenues  which are typically lower in the fourth quarter compared to the rest of the year due to seasonality  were further unfavorably impacted by disruptions to shipments caused by the consolidation process 
net revenues during the fourth quarter were approximately million lower than in the third quarter of this decrease resulted in a decrease in gross profit of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december  in thousands of dollars net revenues   gross profit   gross profit operating expenses   interest and other expenses net loss   net revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to heavy competition in the pesticide market that negatively affected business in the veterinary and otc markets 
in addition  distributors carried forward significant inventories of the preventicr tick collar at year end that resulted in lower than expected sales of these products in the first half of gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly from to due to a shift in sales mix and the outsourcing of manufacturing of some new products launched in  including nutraceuticals and spot ons 
operating expenses decreased million  or  in sales and marketing expenses remained constant but as percentage of revenues increased from to due to higher percentage of marketing dollars spent on the preventicr tick collars and new product launches 
general and administrative expenses remained constant despite increased professional fees incurred in pursuing acquisitions and increased insurance expenses 
warehouse and distribution expenses remained constant but as a percentage of revenues increased from to due to increased freight rates of common carriers 
research and development expense decreased million  or due to the lack of a research and development director from march through september interest expense increased million due to increased borrowings in the company did not record an income tax benefit in connection with its operating loss in  nor in the aggregate amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at december  was approximately million 
this valuation allowance reflects management s view that it is more likely than not that tax benefits related to the company s deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the primary factor affecting management s view in this regard are the company s losses from operations in prior years 
the net loss in of million was million higher than the net loss of million in based on the various factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings and cash infusion from vbsa 
although million was generated by the company s operations before depreciation and amortization  operating activities used million of cash in due primarily to an increase in inventory and a reduction to trade payables 
inventory increased for several reasons the build up in inventory prior to commencing the consolidation of the manufacturing and distribution facilities to reduce the interruption of service to customers  low levels of inventory at the beginning of the year which had created a significant back order position  and the build up of inventory by pmr to serve the purina mills dealer distribution network 
in addition  accounts payable decreased by approximately million reflecting more timely payments to vendors and suppliers 
cash flows used in investing activities in include cash costs related to the merger and capital improvements at the company s bridgeton and fort worth facilities  and acquisition fees related to the in licensing of certain products 
cash flows from financing activities in reflect primarily the merger with agri nutrition group 
in conjunction with the merger  virbac sa invested approximately million of cash in the company 
these funds were used to pay down debt and to repurchase  shares of the company s outstanding common stock at per share in april pursuant to the mandatory tender offer required under the merger agreement 
in addition  borrowing under a credit facility increased to fund working capital needs and the investments described above 
on september   the company replaced all of its then existing credit facilities with a three year million facility 
in december  the company obtained a temporary million increase to its line of credit to fund acquisition fees related to its acquisition of certain product manufacturing and distribution rights discussed below and to fund working capital increases related to the consolidation of the company s production facilities 
this temporary increase is to be repaid in installments from february to july of the remaining million  million is subject to a borrowing formula based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventory and serves as a revolving line of credit 
the availability of the remaining million will be reduced by  per quarter 
the interest rate and fees vary based upon the financial performance of the company as measured by the ratio of ebitda to interest expense paid and current maturities due 
interest rates can vary from prime plus basis points to prime minus basis points 
at december   the company was paying prime minus basis points 
the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants  including but not limited to  tangible net worth and interest coverage ratios  and restricts the payment of dividends 
at december   the company was not in compliance with these covenants 
however  the lending bank has waived such non compliance for periods through april  on may   the company and the bank amended the revolving credit facility and the company would have been in compliance with such amended covenants at december  at december   million was available under the credit facility  as amended 
the company has no current plans to significantly increase capacity of any of its plant facilities or to expend significant capital in modifying them 
at the end of  the company consolidated certain manufacturing and distribution operations that had been carried out at several different facilities  this consolidation required expenditures of approximately  for plant closing costs and minor upgrades to remaining facilities 
in  the company acquired the rights to manufacture and distribution products currently in development by a third party for a period of years 
in december  the company paid  at signing in partial payment for these rights  and  depending upon the third party reaching certain registration milestones  the company is committed to paying in fiscal  and approximately million   and  respectively 
the company expects to be able to fund its fiscal cash requirements through cash flows from operations  initial payments to be received in connection with the licensing of certain products and availability under the credit agreement 
in addition  currently the company has approximately million available under its credit agreement at december  together with the availability under the credit facility  licensing fees and cash flows from operations  the company s current debt maturity requirements  licensing fees commitments and capital expenditure needs are expected to be met 
the company is committed to conduct a public tender offer to purchase up to  of the company s outstanding common stock at a price of per share if  prior to the second anniversary of the merger march  the closing sale price of the company s common stock has not reached per share for a period of consecutive trading days 
pursuant to the merger agreement  such tender offer  if necessary  will be funded by virbac sa s direct purchase from the company of  shares of common stock at per share 
the company has no plans to pay dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
quarterly effects and seasonality the results of operations of certain products in the veterinary product line  including virbac s flea and tick collars  have been seasonal with a lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the results of operations of the company s otc segment have also been seasonal with a relatively lower volume of its sales and earnings being generated during the company s fourth quarter 
seasonal patterns of pm resources operations are highly dependent on weather  feeding economics and the timing of customer orders 
in addition  consolidation of certain manufacturing  distribution  commercial and administrative functions between agnu and virbac  inc during will impact the comparative results of the company between quarters and in future periods 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet measured at fair value 
the original implementation date of fas has been extended and it is now effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or related disclosures 
year compliance the year issue arose as a result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
consequently  these computer programs may contain time sensitive software which recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year the impact of the year issue extended beyond traditional computer hardware and software systems and could have potentially impacted telephone systems  building facilities systems  security systems and systems utilized by outside vendors and customers 
failure to effectively address the year issue could have resulted in a disruption of operations and the inability to process transactions or to perform other normal business activities 
the company reviewed its key hardware and software systems for compliance 
those systems that were not in compliance have been repaired or updated to support year compliance 
less critical systems  such as personal computers  have also been evaluated and upgraded 
the cost of the repairs and upgrades to the key hardware and software systems and to the less critical systems have not been material to the company s financial statements 
the company also evaluated its mission critical vendors and suppliers 
the company recognized that business could have been interrupted because of year problems at one or more of its business partners such as vendors or customers 
the company believes that the year issues did not pose significant operational problems for the company because of its preparedness and because the company s operations are not driven by systems technology 
in addition  year problems at the company s business partners  if any  did not impact the company s business
