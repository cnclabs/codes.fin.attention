item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
our consolidated financial statements for all periods account for palm  inc palm as a discontinued operation  as a result of our decision to distribute the palm common stock we owned to com shareholders in the form of a stock dividend 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
subsequent to the distribution to shareholders on july   palm s operations ceased to be part of our operations and reported results 
change in strategic focus on march   we announced plans to realign our strategy to focus on high growth markets  technologies  and products 
we are structuring our operations around two distinct business models commercial and consumer networks business and carrier networks business 
the commercial and consumer networks business uses a highly leveraged  web enabled business model to deliver the benefits of radical simplicity to millions of customers 
the focus of our commercial and consumer networks business is on targeted sectors of the commercial and consumer markets 
the carrier networks business uses a targeted  direct business model to create high value service delivery solutions for our carrier and network service provider customers 
the focus of our carrier networks business is on carrier class access infrastructures and ip services platforms for the network service provider market 
in support of our new strategy  we also announced a number of investments in new technologies and relationships with other companies 
we are also exiting three major product lines that are no longer strategic to our future 
commercial and consumer networks business we announced three alliances 
we will be integrating inktomi s web caching technology  sonicwall s firewall technology  and f networks layer through layer switching technology with our network solutions 
these capabilities enrich our commercial network solutions by making them more secure and more application ready 
we also announced two voice technology strategic partnerships  one with apropos technology and the other with symbol technologies  that will help us develop ip based call center and multimedia customer interaction centers layered upon our nbx lan telephony solutions 
we announced a strategic relationship with cais  the leading service provider in the hospitality market 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we made a million minority equity investment in cais 
hotel rooms and other such community spaces are examples of small to mid sized locations which are rapidly ramping up their networking capabilities for internet  voice  and video service delivery 
cais is making purchase commitments to us for network infrastructure equipment used to create these vertical solutions for hospitality environments 
during fiscal  we also formed a global alliance with marchfirst to develop  market  and deliver wireless applications for the mobile workplace and converged voice  video  and data solutions 
we made a million minority equity investment in marchfirst and we agreed to contribute up to million to fund the development of several solutions which we will jointly develop and sell 
one of these solutions is distance learning  targeted to the education environment 
the second is enterprise mobility  targeted at the retail environment 
the third is a call center  which brings together advanced telephony and the internet into an integrated environment 
all three of these solutions represent potential high growth markets where customers want turnkey  drop in solutions 
carrier networks business during our fourth fiscal quarter  we acquired call technologies  a virginia based software leader in the field of unified messaging um and carrier class operational support systems oss management 
unified messaging gives people access to any message voice  fax  or email across any network 
the oss product set from call technologies provides carriers with advanced capabilities to deliver end to end services across the network 
we also announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with copper mountain  which will now include copper mountain s digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam product 
this adds dsl as a key access infrastructure to complement our existing access options over dial up  cable  and wireless infrastructures 
we made a million minority equity investment in atrica  a start up in the field of fiber based metropolitan area networking mans 
we expect mans to become another important access infrastructure which will provide the framework for the provisioning  management  and delivery of ip based services

o on january   we entered into a joint venture named admtek  inc admtek 
we contributed approximately million in cash for a percent interest in the joint venture and began consolidating the joint venture with our results  due to our ability to exercise control over its operating and financial policies 
in september  we sold a portion of our existing interest in admtek to our joint venture partner 
as a result of this sale  our ownership interest was reduced and we no longer exercised control over the joint venture 
therefore  during our second fiscal quarter  we began accounting for this investment using the cost method

pro forma results exclude the following  net of taxes purchased in process technology  merger related credits charges  gains on land and facilities  business realignment costs  gains losses on investments  and net income from discontinued operations 
other non recurring charges 
in addition  during our fourth fiscal quarter  we incurred certain non recurring charges related to the exiting of our high end lan and wan chassis and analog only modem product lines 
these costs  which are included in both actual and pro forma results  totaled million  of which million is included in cost of sales  million is included in sales and marketing  million is included in research and development  and million is included in general and administrative 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and may  sales through the end of fiscal  our principal operating segments were network systems and personal connectivity 
as a result of our new strategic focus  our principal operating segments beginning in fiscal are expected to be commercial and consumer networks business and carrier networks business 
fiscal sales totaled billion  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
network systems 
sales of network systems products eg  switches  hubs  remote access concentrators  routers  and customer service and support in fiscal were billion  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the decrease in sales of network systems products when compared to fiscal was due to our business realignment activities as well as increased price competition and loss of market share in the lan workgroup hubs and switches markets 
on march   we announced that we would be exiting our high end lan and wan chassis product lines 
this announcement caused us to experience a significant decrease in sales related to these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as some disruption to the sales of on going products 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal personal connectivity 
sales of personal connectivity products eg  desktop nics  desktop modems  and personal computer pc cards for mobile computers in fiscal were billion  a decrease of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the decrease in sales of personal connectivity products when compared to fiscal was due to our business realignment activities as well as industry wide price declines within the markets for both analog modems and nics 
we announced on march  that we would be exiting our analog only modem product line 
as a result  we experienced a significant decrease in sales related to these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of personal connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal new operating segments 
as a result of our new strategic focus  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to report our financial results in two principal operating segments commercial and consumer networks business and carrier networks business 
we have exited our high end lan and wan chassis product lines and are in the process of exiting our analog only modem product line  and will present sales information for these product lines together  separately from our two operating segments 
geographic 
us sales represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and decreased percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal decreased percent when compared to fiscal the overall decline in both u 
s and international sales is largely attributable to our decision  announced on march   to exit our high end lan and wan chassis and analog only modem product lines as part of our business realignment initiative 
international sales reflected strong growth in the asia pacific region  offset by lower sales in europe 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the decline in gross margins was due to the impact of our business realignment on our fourth quarter results  partially offset by higher gross margin performance during our first three fiscal quarters 
for the first three quarters of fiscal  the gross margin percentage was percent 
the higher gross margin performance during the first three quarters of fiscal was primarily due to improvements in our inventory management  which resulted in reduced manufacturing period costs  partially offset by higher costs for certain product components 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  gross margins were lower due to reduced sales volumes associated with our business realignment 
in addition  we incurred one time charges of million within cost of sales primarily related to excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  and return and rebate programs in connection with the exiting of certain product lines 
the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal was percent 
for fiscal in total  the decline in the gross margin percentage was relatively small because the fourth quarter impact was moderated by higher gross margins during our first three fiscal quarters 
we expect gross margins as a percentage of sales to improve from our fourth quarter levels  trending toward our long term target of to percent of sales  which we expect to reach during fiscal year operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal excluding purchased in process technology charges of million  net gains on land and facilities of million  net merger related credits of million  business realignment costs of million  and million of non recurring charges embedded within sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses related to the exiting of our high end lan and wan chassis and analog only modem product lines  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million  net gains on land and facilities of million  and net merger related credits of million  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of sales were percent  compared to percent for the first three quarters of fiscal we expect operating expenses as a percentage of sales to decrease from our fourth quarter levels  trending toward our long term target of to percent of sales  which we expect to reach during fiscal year sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million or percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was attributable to lower salesforce expenses and reduced spending on marketing programs related to non strategic product lines 
the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was affected by the sharp decline in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as described above  partially offset by the lower salesforce expenses and reduced spending on marketing programs related to non strategic product lines 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were percent  compared to percent for the first three quarters of fiscal in association with our business realignment  we have announced a new com brand identity and branding campaign 
we expect to incur significant expenses on marketing and advertising programs to build consumer and market awareness of our new brand 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased investments in our targeted high growth  emerging product lines multi services access to carrier networks  lan telephony  broadband access primarily cable and dsl  wireless access  home networking  and internet appliances  partially offset by decreased spending related to mature product lines such as analog modems 
the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was affected by the sharp decline in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as described above  as well as the increased investments in our targeted emerging growth product lines 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were percent  compared to percent for the first three quarters of fiscal as part of our business realignment strategy  we are placing a strong focus on our targeted emerging growth markets 
we plan to continue to invest a significant proportion of our financial resources towards developing products for these markets 
in addition  we intend to continue to enter into strategic partnerships  acquire companies with relevant intellectual property  and make strategic investments where appropriate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million or percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to lower bad debt expenses  which resulted from an increased rate of collection of past due accounts  partially offset by higher spending on employee incentive programs and higher consulting costs 
the year over year increase as a percentage of sales was affected by the sharp decline in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as described above  as well as the increase in spending on employee incentive programs and consulting  partially offset by decreased bad debt expenses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were percent  compared to percent for the first three quarters of fiscal purchased in process technology 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million associated with the acquisitions of certain assets of call technologies and lansource 
we have continued to develop technologies that were in process at call technologies and lansource  as of the dates of the acquisitions 
the costs to be incurred for the projects in process are primarily labor costs for design  prototype development  and testing 
as of june   we estimate that approximately million will be spent to complete the acquired research and development projects 
merger related credits charges  net 
during fiscal  we recorded net pre tax merger related credits of approximately million 
this net amount reflects adjustments to previously recorded merger and restructuring charges 
net gains on land and facilities 
during fiscal  we sold our manufacturing facility and related assets in salt lake city  utah to manufacturers services  ltd  and recognized an impairment charge for our remaining salt lake city facility held for sale  which together resulted in a net gain of million 
business realignment costs 
during fiscal  we took steps to refocus our business strategy  change our growth profile  and streamline our operations 
this included the separation and ipo of palm and the realignment of our strategy to focus on high growth markets  technologies  and products 
business realignment costs in fiscal were million  of which million related to the separation of palm from com and million related to implementing our change in strategic focus 
gains losses on investments  net net gains on investments of million were recorded during fiscal  comprised of million of net gains realized on sales of publicly traded equity securities and million of net gains recognized due to fair value adjustments of investments in limited partnership venture capital funds and in private companies acquired by public companies 
during fiscal  losses on investments were million 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase of million compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest income  attributable to higher cash and short term investment balances  as well as higher interest rates 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the increase in tax rate from to was primarily attributable to our gains on investments during fiscal the effective tax rate on all other income for fiscal was percent 
other interests in loss of consolidated joint venture in january  we entered into a joint venture named admtek and began consolidating the joint venture with our results  due to our ability to exercise control over its operating and financial policies 
in september  we sold a portion of our existing interest in admtek to our joint venture partner 
as a result of this sale  our ownership interest was reduced and we no longer exercised control over the joint venture 
therefore  during our second fiscal quarter  we began accounting for this investment using the cost method 
the pro rata share of the joint venture s loss allocated to the other investors for the period during which we had the ability to exercise control over the joint venture was million in fiscal and million in fiscal equity interest in loss of unconsolidated investee in august  we invested million in omnisky corporation omnisky 
this investment was accounted for using the equity method 
for fiscal  equity interest in loss of unconsolidated investee was million 
net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for fiscal net income from discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations includes the results of operations of palm 
net income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  for fiscal net income net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for fiscal excluding certain items purchased in process technology  merger related credits charges  gains on land and facilities  business realignment costs  gains losses on investments  and net income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  pro forma net income was million  or per share for fiscal  compared to million  or per share for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended may  and may  sales fiscal sales totaled billion  an increase of one percent from fiscal sales of billion 
network systems 
sales of network systems products eg  switches  hubs  remote access concentrators  routers  and customer service and support in fiscal were billion  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the increase in network systems products sales when compared to fiscal was primarily due to growth in workgroup switching product sales  customer service sales  and the introduction of our corebuilder enterprise switch  partially offset by a decrease in certain other enterprise systems products 
sales of network systems products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal personal connectivity 
sales of personal connectivity products eg  desktop nics  desktop modems  and pc cards for mobile computers in fiscal were billion  a decrease of eight percent from fiscal sales of billion 
the decline in personal connectivity sales when compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower sales of desktop analog modems 
sales of personal connectivity products represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent of total sales in fiscal our sales in fiscal were primarily impacted by the transformation of our business mix 
historically  a significant portion of our sales has been derived from desktop nics  analog modems  and stackable hubs  which have entered the mature phase of their product life cycles 
sales in these product markets are flat to declining  because these products are particularly sensitive to price competition  are beginning to be replaced by newer technologies  and are increasingly being distributed through the pc oem channel which carries lower average selling prices 
further  our sales of nics and modems are highly correlated with sales in the pc market 
while the overall pc market continues to grow  sales of low end pcs are growing faster than high end pcs 
lower priced pcs are not typically sold with high performance nics and modems such as those we offer 
our aggregate sales increased on a year over year basis primarily because of growth in workgroup switching 
us sales represented percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and decreased three percent when compared to fiscal international sales in fiscal increased six percent when compared to fiscal historically  the asia pacific and latin american regions have been high growth regions for the networking industry and for us 
we believe that fiscal sales were impacted by the economic turmoil that occurred in these markets 
fiscal sales in the asia pacific region remained flat when compared to fiscal in addition  sales in the latin american region decreased by percent when compared to fiscal gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal the year over year gross margin improvement came from virtually all product lines and was primarily the result of product cost reductions  increased mix of certain higher margin network systems products  improved inventory management  and improved manufacturing capacity utilization 
operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal were billion  or percent of sales  compared to billion  or percent of sales in fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and a merger related credit of million  and net gains on land and facilities of million  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal excluding a purchased in process technology charge of million and a merger related charge of million primarily associated with the us robotics merger  operating expenses would have been billion  or percent of sales for fiscal the decline as a percentage of sales was primarily due to cost reductions as a result of post merger consolidation activities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million or five percent from fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in spending related to mature product lines such as analog modems 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased million or six percent compared to fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the cost of developing new products and enhancements in the areas of switching  voip and lan telephony  wireless access  broadband access primarily cable and dsl  and nics 
the timely introduction of new technologies and products is crucial to our success  and we plan to continue to make acquisitions or strategic investments to accelerate time to market where appropriate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million or ten percent from fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is primarily due to the elimination of duplicate infrastructure from the us robotics merger  partially offset by an increase in the provision for bad debts  primarily related to receivables in certain international regions 
purchased in process technology 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for purchased in process technology of approximately million associated with the acquisitions of nbx  and certain assets of ics 
merger related credits charges  net 
during fiscal  we recorded net pre tax merger related credits of approximately million 
this net amount reflects adjustments to previously recorded merger and restructuring charges  composed of a net pre tax credit of approximately million and a million charge reflecting a change in the estimated net realizable value of closed manufacturing plants in chicago 
net gains on land and facilities 
during fiscal  we recorded a million net gain on the sale of land in california 
gains losses on investments  net during fiscal  losses on investments from sales of publicly traded equity securities were million 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances  improved foreign currency results  and reduced interest expense 
interest and other income  net for fiscal included foreign currency losses of approximately million  primarily related to korean operations  where foreign exchange hedges were not available  or were available only to a limited extent 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to an early call premium and write off of unamortized issuance fees associated with the redemption of convertible notes 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the tax rate in fiscal reflected certain merger related and other costs associated with the merger with us robotics that were not deductible 
in addition  the decrease in tax rate from to was also due to the increase in offshore manufacturing in countries with tax rates significantly below the us statutory rate 
other interests in loss of consolidated joint venture in january  we entered into a joint venture named admtek and began consolidating the joint venture with our results  due to our ability to exercise control over its operating and financial policies 
the pro rata share of the joint venture s loss allocated to the other investors for the period between the date of investment and the end of our fiscal year was million in fiscal net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for fiscal net income from discontinued operations net income from discontinued operations includes the results of operations of palm

some of the factors that could cause future results to materially differ from past results or those described in forward looking statements include those discussed below 
business transition to new strategic focus since announcing our realignment plans on march   we began to execute the steps which management believes are necessary to transition our business and realign our strategic focus towards high growth markets  technologies  and products see related discussion of new strategic focus below 
we have exited our high end lan and wan chassis product lines and are transferring our analog only modem product line to a newly formed joint venture company in which we hold a minority interest 
these businesses  in the past  have generated significant sales but limited profits for us 
internal and external changes resulting from realignment and transition towards our new strategic focus may disrupt our customers  partners  distributors  and employees and create a prolonged period of uncertainty  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our new strategy requires substantial changes including exiting certain product lines and spinning off our handheld computing business  reducing employee headcount  investing in new technologies  partnering with other companies  and establishing leadership positions in new high growth markets 
many factors may impact our ability to implement this strategy  including our ability to finalize agreements with other companies  manage the implementation internally  sustain the productivity of our workforce  introduce innovative new products in a timely manner  reduce operating expenses  and quickly respond to and recover from unforeseen events associated with the transition and realignment 
as a result of the business transition and realignment that we announced on march   it will be difficult to forecast our financial performance 
however  we expect that both sales and operating income may continue to be negatively impacted  and we expect to report operating losses in fiscal in addition  we expect that we will continue to incur business realignment charges through at least the first quarter of fiscal transfer of analog only modem product line we have signed separate agreements with our partners accton technology and natsteel electronics pertaining to the transfer of our analog only modem product line to a joint venture 
the new company is called us robotics corporation new usr and we hold a minority equity position 
although new usr is established and staffed  the actual transfer of the product line and customers to new usr is not yet complete 
we have entered into non binding agreements pertaining to the sale or transfer of our manufacturing and distribution operations based in chicago  illinois and our mount prospect  illinois manufacturing facility 
the companies continue to negotiate the terms of these transactions  which may result in the sale  lease  or transfer of these facilities 
these transactions are subject to ongoing negotiations and there can be no guarantee that we will reach final agreement 
furthermore  these separation activities are very time consuming and resource intensive and may dilute management focus 
in addition  we entered into transitional service agreements in the areas of information technology systems  supply chain management  buildings and services  and certain treasury finance functions 
we will begin such services prior to transfer and for a period of up to one year afterwards 
if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under these agreements  including specifically the successful set up of information technology systems  the transfer of the product line and manufacturing operations could be delayed and we may be held liable for any resulting losses 
new product lines and markets our financial performance and future growth depend upon the rapid growth of new markets  and our ability to establish a leadership position in those markets 
we are investing a significant proportion of our resources in several emerging product lines in markets that are forecasted to grow at a significantly higher rate than the networking industry average 
we expect these product lines to account for a higher percentage of our sales over time 
we are focused on the following high growth and emerging product lines  leveraging our investments in broadband  wireless  and ip telephony technologies o multi services access to carrier networks o lan telephony o broadband access primarily cable and dsl o wireless access o home networking o internet appliances at the present time  the markets for these products and solutions are still emerging 
industry standards for these technologies are yet to be widely adopted and the market potential remains unproven 
while these product lines are a rapidly growing portion of our business  they currently generate a relatively small amount of sales 
if these markets do not grow at a significant rate or if we do not increase our sales in these product lines  our financial results would be adversely affected 
ability to develop and introduce new products products in the markets in which we compete have short life cycles 
therefore  our success depends on our ability to identify new market and product opportunities  to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  and to gain market acceptance of new products  particularly in our targeted high growth  emerging markets 
for example  the timely introduction of the following products are important to our success o a next generation carrier class platform for certain applications in ip telephony and third generation g wireless solutions for our carrier customers o a new line of gigabit on copper lan solutions primarily for commercial enterprises o a new line of broadband modems both cable and dsl that support data and voice o new standards based wireless lan solutions  including our airconnect wireless lan  for both commercial and consumer markets o a new generation of residential internet appliances o a next generation superstack workgroup solution for commercial enterprises any delay in new product introductions or lower than anticipated demand for our new products could have an adverse affect on our operating results or financial condition  particularly in those product markets we have identified as emerging high growth opportunities 
concentration of sales from fewer products by realigning our business  spinning off palm  and exiting certain product lines  our nic  lan workgroup  and carrier access products will comprise the majority of our sales 
as a result  any adverse events in these three businesses will have a more pronounced impact on our financial results as a whole 
furthermore  sales of traditional nics and hubs have been generally declining over the past year and we believe that these declines represent long term trends 
consequently  we believe that sales derived from these products will continue to decline 
if sales of these products decline more rapidly than expected  this would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
moderate growth markets in which we participate include lan workgroup switching and remote access 
however  our sales of lan workgroup switches have declined over the recent past 
we expect these products will resume growth and account for a significant portion of our sales  but if sales of these products continue to decline  our financial results would be adversely affected 
reliance on distributors  resellers  and pc oems we distribute many of our products through two tiered distribution channels that include distributors  systems integrators  value added resellers  and retailers 
we also sell to pc oems and large enterprises and service providers 
under our new strategic focus  we will increase our commitment to and become increasingly reliant upon our two tiered distribution model as well as sales to oems 
we will also be developing our carrier channel through expanded partnerships with internet service providers isps 
our future results and financial condition are partially dependent on a number of factors relating to this distribution model  including the impact of our business realignment  issues associated with competition among and within our channels  selling to pc oems  and channel inventory and customer concentration 
business realignment 
the march announcements and the activities surrounding our business realignment may adversely impact our ongoing relationships with our channel partners and the perception of us among end customers o we have exited our high end lan and wan chassis product lines and are in the process of exiting our analog only modem product line 
in the past  through our channel partners  we have been able to present end to end networking solutions and complementary products to end customers  which we believe synergistically generated sales 
as a result of the business realignment  there may be a negative effect on sales of ongoing products  since these products may not be perceived to be part of a larger integrated or complementary solution 
o as part of our business realignment  we reduced our direct  large account sales resources  which were primarily dedicated to promoting the now discontinued high end lan and wan chassis products 
we will still be targeting such customers for our continuing high volume products 
however  the reduction in our large account salesforce may result in our sales being adversely impacted 
o customers and channel partners may attempt to return products they have already purchased or cancel orders recently placed 
due to our business realignment  we have experienced a higher level of such returns and cancellations and expect that they will continue at least into the first quarter of fiscal therefore  we may have declining levels of business through our traditional distribution channels as a result of impaired relationships with partners and end customers 
there can be no guarantee that we can re establish such relationships or forge new channel and end customer relationships in a timely manner to overcome any loss of business to existing customers or channel disruptions for sell through of our new products 
inventory levels in channel 
our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our products 
as part of our efforts to optimize our supply chain see related discussion in the supply chain management risk factor  we have reduced the number of our distributors and are currently reducing levels of inventory held by the distributors through whom we sell our products 
we work closely with our distributors and resellers to monitor inventory levels and ensure that appropriate levels of products are available to end users 
notwithstanding such efforts  if channel partners attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand  our sales could be negatively impacted 
reliance on a small number of distributors 
a significant portion of our sales are made to a few customers 
in fiscal  ingram micro represented approximately percent of our total sales and tech data represented approximately percent of our total sales 
ingram micro and tech data are both distributors of our products 
we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to purchase our products at current levels 
additionally  consolidation among distributors is reducing the number of distributors in the north american market 
because our sales are becoming more concentrated among a smaller number of customers  our results of operations  financial condition  or market share could be adversely affected if our customers o stop purchasing our products or focus more on selling our competitors products  o reduce  delay  or cancel their orders  o become unable to sell our products because we do not ship the products to them in a timely manner  or o experience competitive  operational  or financial difficulties  impairing our ability to collect payments from them 
pc oems 
pc related networking products such as nics and pc cards are increasingly being sold through the pc oem channel rather than the distribution channel 
we derive a significant portion of our personal connectivity product sales from pc oems such as dell computer  toshiba  gateway  hewlett packard  and ibm  manufacturers that incorporate our nics  pc cards  or chipsets into their products 
while sales to pc oems are important  products sold through the pc oem channel typically have a lower average selling price than those sold through other channels 
therefore  our sales and margins may be adversely impacted if sales to pc oems continue to become a larger percentage of our business 
e business web enablement initiative a key initiative for us is to drive broad web enablement of sales  supply chain  and internal processes 
we are building in house capabilities to sell directly to end user customers bc and distribution partners bb over the internet e business 
this e business initiative could cause conflict with our current indirect channels of distribution 
if we are unsuccessful in selling through our e business channel  we could also lose market share to competitors who have more successfully developed these capabilities 
these changes in the pattern of distribution of networking products could have a material adverse effect on our sales and financial results 
we have also invested substantial time and resources into deploying the web as the primary medium and platform for internal applications and processes across com 
this involves redesigning some of our core business processes  including forecasting  supply chain operations  and order fulfillment 
implementing this initiative will require enhanced information systems  substantial training  and disciplined execution 
we believe that the successful web enablement of com is critical to our long term competitive position 
there can be no assurances  however  that this initiative will be implemented successfully or that disruptions in operations will not occur in the process 
changes in our industry  role of acquisitions and investments the networking business is highly competitive  and as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
our new strategic focus on emerging and high growth product lines mandates that we act quickly and effectively to enter into new markets 
one of the ways we will address this need is through acquisitions of and minority equity investments in companies with promising technology and products and or proven market access and position 
for example  the acquisition of call technologies enhances the service capabilities for our commworks architecture and our total control multi service access platform 
in addition  our acquisition of kerbango will allow us to offer consumers a rich internet experience by providing a complete internet audio solution for the home and office 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following o difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  o the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  o potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  o risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  o the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and o an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired entity  which may result in unexpected dilution to our earnings 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any such acquisition 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our acquisition of technology  products  or market access through equity investments is usually coupled with a strategic commercial relationship 
our investments tend to be in very early stage technology companies with unproven technology and products 
there can be no assurances that we can successfully form appropriate commercial relationships to gain and integrate such products or technology into our technology or product lines or that such companies will not be subsequently acquired by third parties  including competitors of ours 
in general  there have been many mergers and acquisitions in the networking industry in the past several years 
there have also been mergers between telecommunications equipment providers and networking companies  as well as between networking companies and computer component suppliers 
more recently  several companies have announced divestitures and spin offs 
examples over the past months include o we acquired kerbango  call technologies  interactive web concepts  and lansource  o lucent technologies  a telecommunications company  acquired companies  including networking equipment supplier ascend communications 
lucent also announced it is spinning off its private branch exchange pbx business  o cisco systems  a networking equipment supplier  acquired companies  o nortel networks  a telecommunications company  acquired nine companies and integrated the operations of previously acquired bay networks  a networking equipment supplier 
nortel also announced it is spinning off its netgear business  o alcatel  a telecommunications company  acquired four companies  including xylan  a networking equipment supplier  o siemens  a telecommunications company  acquired three networking firms  o intel  a computer component manufacturer  acquired companies with networking technology 
o cabletron systems  a networking company  announced its plans to split its company into four separate operating companies 
future changes in the networking industry may result in more companies with greater resources and stronger competitive positions and products than us 
furthermore  companies may be created that are able to respond more rapidly to market opportunities 
continued changes in our industry may adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
management of strategic relationships and investments in addition to mergers and acquisitions  technology companies are continually entering into strategic relationships 
for example  over the past months  we announced or expanded strategic relationships with numerous companies including the following o at t o hewlett packard o accton technology o hitachi o apropos technology o ibm o bell atlantic o inktomi o broadcom o marchfirst formerly usweb cks o cais internet o microsoft o copper mountain networks o natsteel electronics o dell computer o samsung electronics o extreme networks o sonicwall o f networks o symbol technologies o gateway if successful  these relationships will be mutually beneficial and result in industry and market growth 
however  these alliances carry an element of risk since  in most cases  we must compete in some business areas with companies with which we have strategic alliances and  at the same time  cooperate with such companies in other business areas 
also  if these companies fail to perform  or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected  we could suffer delays in product or market development or other operational difficulties 
also  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted if we experience difficulties managing relationships with our partners or if projects with partners are unsuccessful 
in addition  if our competitors enter into successful strategic relationships  they could increase the competition that we face 
we have also made strategic investments in several other technology companies 
some of these investments have significantly appreciated in value since the companies became publicly traded 
our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely impacted if the market value of our investments declines 
competition for key personnel  retention and recruiting our success depends to a significant extent upon a number of key employees and management 
over the past year  we have experienced an increased rate of employee turnover compared to historical levels 
the rate of voluntary attrition may be further increased by specific events such as the separation and spin off of palm and the business realignment announced on march  some employees may have experienced increased disruptions and decline in morale as a result of the involuntary headcount reductions and other changes in corporate direction required by our new focus 
the loss of the services of key employees could adversely affect our product introduction schedules  customer relationships  operating results  or financial condition 
the ability to recruit employees  both to replace attrition and to grow our emerging businesses  may be a significant challenge due to uncertainty caused by our business realignment and due to the increasingly competitive marketplace for needed skills 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel  including engineers  continues to be highly competitive 
there has been a dramatic increase of technology start up companies recruiting for the same talent that we require 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain skilled personnel  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
in addition  we must carefully balance the growth in our employee base commensurate with our anticipated sales growth 
if our sales growth or attrition levels vary significantly  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  our common stock price has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
when our common stock price is less than the exercise price of stock options granted to employees  turnover is likely to increase  which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
palm separation on february   we separated the operations of our palm subsidiary into an independent company 
subsequently  palm made an initial public offering of its common stock on march  and we distributed our remaining ownership of outstanding palm common stock to com shareholders on july  the distribution ratio was shares of palm for each outstanding share of com common stock 
as part of the separation  we entered into certain transitional service agreements with palm to support ongoing palm operations relating to information technology systems  supply chain management  human resources administration  product order administration  customer service  buildings and facilities  treasury management  and legal  finance  and accounting 
these transitional service agreements generally have terms of less than two years following the separation 
if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under these agreements  we may be held liable for any resulting losses allegedly suffered by palm 
further  as each of these service agreements expire  the fees and cost reimbursements currently being paid to us by palm for the associated services will also cease 
consequently  unless we are able to reduce certain of our costs in line with the decreased fees and demand for services from palm  our total expenses will become a disproportionately higher percentage of sales  thereby adversely impacting our financial results 
to enable our distribution of palm common stock to our shareholders  we received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the distribution will be not be taxable 
such ruling requires com and palm  for up to two years following the distribution date  not to engage in certain business combinations that would constitute a change of more than percent of the equity interest in either company 
if either com or palm fail to conform to requirements set forth in the ruling  there would be material adverse consequences  potentially including making the distribution taxable 
finally  at the time of the distribution of palm shares to our shareholders  an adjustment was made to stock options held by our employees to preserve the intrinsic value of these options and the ratio of the exercise price to the market price 
as of july  there were approximately million employee options outstanding 
immediately after the palm distribution  there were approximately million employee options outstanding  of which approximately million were vested and immediately exercisable 
the exercise of stock options by employees may potentially result in a dilution in the ownership interest of our current shareholders 
competition and pricing pressure we participate in a highly volatile industry characterized by vigorous competition for market share as well as rapid product and technology development and maturation 
our competition comes from start up companies  well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  and other companies focusing on networking 
however  our industry is changing  resulting in new competitors who have greater financial  marketing  and technical resources than we do 
for example  technology innovations are driving the convergence of voice  video  and data traffic onto a single network infrastructure  and we now compete with much larger telecommunications equipment companies such as alcatel  cisco systems  hewlett packard  intel  lucent technologies  nortel networks  and siemens 
in addition  both we and our competitors sometimes lower product prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal we continued to experience price competition in our distribution channel  particularly for price sensitive products sold through catalogs and certain workgroup systems products 
intense pricing competition in our industry may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we are also selling products into new markets where we compete with different companies than in the past 
this is especially true in our high growth emerging markets 
our principal competitors in this area include com  clarent  efficient networks  motorola  netgear  redback networks  sonus networks  and xircom 
these competitors  in part because of their more specific focus  may be able to respond more rapidly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could harm our business  operating results  or financial condition 
semiconductor manufacturers  such as intel  are increasingly integrating more nic and modem functionality onto a single chip on the motherboard 
this trend may offer pc oems and other networking customers cheaper alternatives to our solutions 
if integration of networking and computer processing functionality on a reduced number of components increases  our future sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
furthermore  some of these semiconductor manufacturers may be our current suppliers of components  therefore  we may be competing directly with our vendors in certain future situations 
uncertainties of international markets we operate internationally and expect that international markets will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales 
some international markets are characterized by economic and political instability and currency fluctuations that can adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
our results of operations in the past have been adversely impacted by economic instability in the asia pacific and latin american regions 
today  asia pacific represents our fastest growing geographic region 
however  should this region experience economic instability  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
industry standards and regulations our success also depends on o the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  o resolution of conflicting us and international standards requirements created by the convergence of technology such as voice onto data networks  o the timely introduction of new standards compliant products  and o a favorable regulatory environment 
slow market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  if we fail to achieve timely certification of compliance to industry standards for our products  our sales of such products could be adversely affected 
there are a number of new product initiatives  particularly in the area of wireless access  ip telephony  and broadband access that could be impacted by new or revised regulations  which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  development of a new global third generation standard for wireless internet access is underway and expected to be based on code division multiple access cdma 
however  several technologies including global system for mobile communication gsm  personal digital cellular pdc  and time division multiple access tdma are competing for the standard  which will ultimately be determined by the international telecommunications union itu 
customer order fulfillment the timing and amount of our sales depend on a number of factors that make estimating operating results prior to the end of any period uncertain 
for example  we do not typically maintain a significant backlog and sales are dependent on our ability to appropriately forecast product demand 
in addition  our customers historically request fulfillment of orders in a short period of time  resulting in limited visibility to sales trends 
consequently  our operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders and our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner 
historically  sales in the third month of the quarter have been higher than sales in each of the first two months of the quarter 
non linear sales patterns make business planning difficult  and increase the risk that our quarterly results will fluctuate due to disruptions in functions such as manufacturing  order management  information systems  and shipping 
warranties and international requirements because our products are often covered by warranties  we may be subject to contractual and or legal commitments to perform under such warranties 
if our products fail to perform as warranted and we do not resolve product quality or performance issues in a timely manner  our operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
likewise  if we fail to meet commitments related to the installation of networks  we could be subject to claims for business disruption or consequential damages if a network implementation is not completed successfully or in a timely manner 
our products are sold and marketed in many countries  and as such  our products must function in and meet the requirements of many different telecommunications environments and be compatible with various telecommunications systems and products 
if our products fail to meet the requirements of international telecommunication environments  our sales could be negatively impacted 
our business realignment actions announced on march  include transition of certain business lines to third parties  such as analog only modems  or obsolescence of certain product lines such as high end lan and wan chassis products 
to the extent that third parties do not assume or fulfill our warranty obligations  we will remain obligated to provide warranty support  including repair services and spare parts for the duration of contracts or statutory legal requirements 
any failure to perform such commitments could subject us to claims  which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
supply chain management some key components of our products and some services on which we rely are currently available only from single or limited sources 
in addition  some of our suppliers are also our competitors 
while we generally have been able to obtain adequate supplies of components from existing sources  we cannot be certain that in the future our suppliers will be able to meet our demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
for example  due to strong world wide demand  the electronics industry is facing shortages on various memory devices and passive components 
due to these shortages  our ability to procure these components and meet our on time delivery requirements in a cost effective manner could be impacted 
our operating results  financial condition  or customer relationships could be adversely affected by these shortages 
these adverse effects could result from an inability to fulfill customer demand or increased costs to acquire key components or services 
increasingly  we have been sourcing a greater number of components from a select number of vendors to obtain better pricing through higher volumes 
also  there has recently been a trend toward consolidation of vendors of electronic components 
this greater reliance on a smaller number of suppliers increases our risk of experiencing unfavorable price fluctuations or a disruption in supply 
further  as a result of our business realignment activities  we may not have the same degree of purchasing power as we have had in the past 
this could result in higher material costs 
recently  we have made significant improvements to our supply chain processes 
however  we may not be able to achieve cost reductions at the same rate as realized in prior quarters or at a rate fast enough to keep pace with any price erosion across our product lines 
any failure to achieve cost reductions at a comparable rate to average selling price declines will have a negative impact on our gross margins and financial results 
the cost  quality  and availability of third party manufacturing operations are essential to the successful production and sale of many of our products 
the inability of any third party manufacturer to meet our cost  quality  and availability standards could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in our continual effort to streamline our supply chain operations  we sold our salt lake city  utah manufacturing facility to manufacturers services  ltd 
msl in november in connection with the recently announced strategic realignment  we anticipate further changes to our supply chain operations 
the sale  transfer or consolidation of other manufacturing facilities  including our mt 
prospect  illinois manufacturing facility  if not properly executed  could lead to supply disruptions  an inability to satisfy demand  higher costs  or quality issues across our various businesses which could be costly to remedy 
any of these scenarios would have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
since we have improved our supply chain capabilities  we plan to reduce our channel inventory model 
improvements in our supply chain management have enabled us to reduce our channel inventory model by two weeks on average 
we have been operating within our existing channel inventory model of between five to seven weeks of supply on hand for the past two fiscal years 
if we are unable to sustain the improvements in our supply chain capabilities or encounter external supply chain disruptions  we may experience product stock outs or shortages  which could adversely impact our financial results 
commercial commitments we enter into minimum quantity or other non cancelable commitments as needed 
for example  we have committed to minimum purchases of product components from a vendor through the end of calendar year these types of agreements subject us to risk depending on future events 
if  for example  sales volumes of certain products fluctuate significantly  we may be unable to meet our commitments 
this may result in us incurring liabilities that adversely affect our financial results 
intellectual property rights many of our competitors  such as telecommunications and computer equipment manufacturers  have large intellectual property portfolios  including patents that may cover technologies that are relevant to our business 
in addition  many smaller companies  universities  and individual inventors have obtained or applied for patents in areas of technology that may relate to our business 
the industry is moving towards aggressive assertion  licensing  and litigation of patents and other intellectual property rights 
in the course of our business  we frequently receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
we evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights  and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses or cross licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies  protocols  or specifications in our products 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses on favorable terms for intellectual property rights required for the manufacture  sale  and use of our products  particularly those which must comply with industry standard protocols and specifications to be commercially viable  our business  results of operations  or financial condition could be adversely impacted 
in addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties rights  we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our intellectual property rights 
whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others  intellectual property litigation can be complex  costly  protracted  and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
further  plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain 
thus  the existence of or any adverse determinations in this litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs 
in addition  if we are the alleged infringer  we could be required to seek licenses from others or be prevented from manufacturing or selling our products  which could cause disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete 
if we are asserting our intellectual property rights  we could be prevented from stopping others from manufacturing or selling competitive products 
any one of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fluctuations in quarterly results  volatility of stock price our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly 
a wide variety of factors can cause these fluctuations  including o seasonality  o the introduction and acceptance of new products and technologies  o price competition  o general conditions and trends in the networking industry and technology sector  o internal reorganizations or realignments  o disruption in international markets  o general economic conditions  o industry consolidations and acquisitions  o disruption in the distribution channel  and o timing of orders received within the quarter 
in recent years  we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results due to some of the factors listed above 
these factors  and accompanying fluctuations in periodic operating results  could have a significant adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
additionally  we anticipate that the activities surrounding our announced business realignment and the transition to our new strategic focus will contribute significantly to fluctuations in the quarterly operating results for the next several quarters 
our stock price has historically experienced substantial price volatility and we expect that this will continue  particularly due to fluctuations in quarterly operating results as outlined above  variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published analysts expectations  and as a result of announcements by our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies 
these market price fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our stock in the future 
proposed changes in accounting for business combinations and intangible assets the financial accounting standards board fasb began deliberation of revisions to the rules for business combinations and intangible assets in some of these deliberations have included accounting rule making bodies from other nations as the financial communities attempt to develop global consistency where possible 
business combination rules govern the accounting for mergers and acquisitions used in either a purchase or a pooling of interests combination 
business combinations may generate intangible assets including goodwill which represent the excess purchase price of an acquired enterprise over net identifiable assets 
tentative conclusions of the fasb will prohibit the use of pooling of interests and will establish new accounting standards and financial presentation for intangible assets resulting from business combinations 
the fasb expects to issue a final standard by the end of calendar year the final standard is not expected to address accounting for in process research and development costs 
changes to the current accounting rules for business combinations and intangible assets will not preclude mergers or acquisitions but may increase the earnings dilution associated with future transactions 
in addition  if pooling of interests accounting is no longer available  we may use cash more often than our common stock to pay for acquisitions of other companies 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments at june  were billion  an increase of billion from billion at may  for the fiscal year ended june   net cash generated from operating activities was million 
accounts receivable at june  decreased million from may  to million 
days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at june   compared to days at may  inventory levels at june  decreased million from the prior fiscal year end to million 
annualized inventory turnover was turns for the quarter ended june   compared to turns for the quarter ended may  as part of our com ventures initiative  we selectively make strategic investments in the equity securities of privately held companies and limited partnership venture capital funds 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash proceeds from the sale of investments were million 
we have established com ventures ii  which plans to make strategic investments of an additional million 
during the fiscal year ended june   we made million in capital expenditures 
major capital expenditures included upgrades and expansion of our facilities and purchases and upgrades of systems and equipment 
as of june   we had approximately million in capital expenditure commitments outstanding primarily associated with facilities renovation and information system projects 
in addition  we have commitments relating to lease arrangements in the us  under which we have an option to purchase the properties for an aggregate of million  or arrange for the sale of the properties to a third party 
if the properties are sold to a third party at less than the option price  we retain an obligation for a portion of the shortfall  subject to certain provisions of the lease 
additionally  during fiscal  we sold two facilities in the chicago and salt lake city areas and equipment in the chicago area for total net proceeds of million 
we also acquired certain assets of three companies for a combined total of million in cash  net of cash acquired 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program in the amount of up to one billion dollars 
such repurchases could be used to offset the issuance of additional shares resulting from employee stock option exercises and the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
the board has authorized a two year time limit on the repurchase authorizations 
this new program replaces previous authorizations totaling million shares between june and september during fiscal  million shares of common stock were repurchased for a total purchase price of million 
during fiscal  we received net cash of million from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and option plans 
during fiscal  we repaid million of borrowings under the unsecured senior notes agreement 
as of june   million of this debt remained outstanding  of which million is due within one year 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months

management has not completed its evaluation of the effects  if any  that sab will have on our income statement presentation  operating results  or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at june  and may   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short term investment portfolio 
at june  and may   we had approximately million and million of outstanding obligations under certain real estate lease arrangements with monthly payments tied to short term interest rates and lease residual guarantees 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased payments associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income or cash flows 
in addition  we also have a mixture of fixed and floating rate long term debt of approximately million as of june  and million as of may  a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value or cash flows associated with this debt 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward and option contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from june  and may  market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from june  and may  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts by million and million  respectively 
there were no outstanding foreign exchange option contracts as of june  a hypothetical percent appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar from may  market rates would have increased or decreased the unrealized value of our foreign currency option contracts by an immaterial amount 
the gains or losses on the forward and option contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
equity security price risk 
we hold a portfolio of publicly traded equity securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had an million impact on the value of these securities in fiscal equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had a million impact on the value of these securities in fiscal equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had a million impact on the value of these securities held in fiscal equity security price fluctuations of plus or minus percent would have had a million impact on the value of these securities held in fiscal
