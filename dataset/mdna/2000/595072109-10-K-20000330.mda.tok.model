overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  with an average amount financed of approximately  the company primarily leases pos authorization systems and other small business equipment to small commercial enterprises 
for years ended december  and  the company had fundings to dealers upon origination of leases  contracts and loans dealer fundings of million and million  respectively  and revenues of million and million  respectively 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments from lessees who continue to rent the equipment beyond the original lease term  and fee income 
the company funds the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than  the equipment s estimated economic life  and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  substantially all service and rental contracts are month to month contracts with an expected term of seven years for service contracts and months for rental contracts 
certain accounting considerations the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interests is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
rental equipment is recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of twelve months 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of the historical loss experience of the company and the level of recourse provided by such lease  service contract or loan  if any  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering future economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying lease portfolio 
the company determines the necessary periodic provision for credit losses taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts and loans 
such provisions generally represent a percentage of funded amounts of leases  contracts and loans 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for credit losses 
leases  service contracts  and loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses and are put on non accrual when they are deemed to be uncollectable 
generally  the company deems leases  service contracts and loans to be uncollectable when one of the following occur i the obligor files for bankruptcy  ii the obligor dies and the equipment is returned  or iii when an account has become days delinquent 
the typical monthly payment under the company s leases is between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee will only owe lease payments of between and 
the company has developed and regularly updates proprietary credit scoring systems designed to improve its risk based pricing 
the company uses credit scoring in most  but not all  of its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company aggressively employs collection procedures and a legal process to resolve any credit problems

the company s provision reflected a cumulative write off of non accruing fully reserved receivables in the company s securitized portfolio

unearned income decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease resulted primarily from increased acquisitions of service contracts and originations of loans which are accounted for on a cost basis and as a result do not have any unearned income associated with them  as well as one time write offs in of approximately million in consumer satellite television equipment lease receivables and million of securitized receivables and the corresponding unearned income associated with those leases 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new leases  contracts and loans 
since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  and an initial public offering completed in february of the company has also funded its operations through the issuance of subordinated debt  however no new subordinated debt was issued in the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
the company s uses of cash include the origination and acquisition of leases  contracts and loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under its credit facilities  subordinated debt and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
the company utilizes its credit facilities to fund the origination and acquisition of leases that satisfy the eligibility requirements established pursuant to each facility 
on december   the company entered into a new million credit facility  expiring on september   with seven banks 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under the facility 
the company also may use its subordinated debt program as a source of funding for potential acquisitions of portfolios and leases which otherwise are not eligible for funding under the credit facilities and for potential portfolio purchases 
to date  cash flow from its portfolio and other fees have been sufficient to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and subordinated debt 
the company believes that cash flow from its operations and amounts available under its credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
although the company is not currently involved in negotiations and has no current commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions  to the extent that the company successfully consummates acquisitions  it may be necessary to finance such acquisitions through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  the incurrence of indebtedness or a combination of both

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  or fair value of the financial instrument and derivative instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
the company uses these instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments held by the company are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
interest rate risk management this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings of the financial instruments and derivative instruments held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate risk connected to existing liabilities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
because the company s net earnings exposure under the combined debt and interest rate swap was to day eurodollar  the hypothetical loss was modeled by calculating the percent adverse change in day eurodollar and then multiplying it by the face amount of the debt which equaled the face amount of the interest rate swap 
the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facilities 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness  including indebtedness outstanding under the company s securitizations and indebtedness subject to the swap described below  represented of the company s outstanding indebtedness 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with one of its banks 
this arrangement  which expires in july  has a notional amount of million which represented of the company s fixed rate indebtedness outstanding at december  the interest rate associated with the swap is capped at 
during the term of the swap  the company has agreed to match the swap amount with day eurodollar loans 
if at any time the day eurodollar rate exceeds the swap cap of  the bank would pay the company the difference 
through december   the company had entered into eurodollar loans with interest rates ranging from to 
this arrangement effectively changes the company s floating interest rate exposure on the million notional amount to a fixed rate of 
the aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings on an annual basis on all financial instruments and derivative instruments that would have resulted from a hypothetical increase of percent in day eurodollar  sustained for one month  is estimated to be
