net sales decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to the impact of dealer inventory adjustments in the european market and the resulting changes in seasonality of shipments to european retailers  coupled with the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar 
conversely  the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to sales growth in the european bicycle market as the awareness of the cannondale brand continued to strengthen globally 
overall  the company s rate of sales growth during the past three years has decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in inventory by many of the company s domestic and international dealers and the reduced growth in the bicycle market 
in light of this  the company has made an effort to partner itself with specialty bicycle retailers capable of achieving growth objectives consistent with those of the company 
net sales reported by cannondale us were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net sales reported by cannondale europe decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  the significant decrease in cannondale europe s net sales during fiscal resulted from the dealer inventory adjustments and the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar  as mentioned above

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the reduction in the gross profit rate in fiscal reflects a less favorable sales mix between the domestic market and the international market  where the company typically achieves a higher gross profit rate 
additionally  the strengthening of the japanese yen during fiscal compared to the us dollar and the euro negatively affected the cost of components from japanese suppliers  thus reducing the gross profit percentage 
furthermore  the production start up costs of the mx contributed to the lower gross profit rate in fiscal as such costs were not proportionately offset by revenues 
the decrease in the gross profit rate in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects price pressure on the company and other bicycle suppliers in conjunction with the maturation of the bicycle market and reduction in its growth rate 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal which had increased from million in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects the reductions in expenses directly related to sales levels  such as freight  advertising  and travel  coupled with the effect of the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar

interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal compared to fiscal reflects higher interest rates and debt levels associated with the company s continued investment in the motorsports product development 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal is a result of the debt incurred associated with the company s repurchase of million and million of its common stock during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  its investment of million and million in capital expenditures during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and the increase in working capital requirements 
interest expense incurred by the company in fiscal  and as a result of the million loan to joseph montgomery is offset by interest charged to him and is recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations

the following table presents selected unaudited quarterly data for the two most recent fiscal years 
this information has been prepared by the company on a basis consistent with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such quarters 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

in addition  the company s business is seasonal due to consumer spending patterns  which in turn affect dealer delivery preferences  and historically has resulted in more shipments and significantly stronger results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters january through june 
for fiscal  and  the company s operating results have deviated from this historical pattern 
through its arp program  the company attempts to reduce the seasonality of its shipments and to smooth the production process by providing incentives for retailers to take delivery of a higher percentage of their annual bicycle order in the first and second fiscal quarters 
during fiscal  significant inventory reductions among the company s international dealers occurred  which mirrored the trend that began in fiscal among the company s domestic dealers 
for both fiscal and  the inventory reduction by the company s dealers was a significant cause of the variation in the historical pattern of stronger sales in the company s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the third and fourth fiscal quarters together accounted for and of the company s total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the change in dealer delivery preferences  the company expanded its arp at the end of fiscal under the expanded arp  the cannondale sales force formulates a delivery plan with its retailers  typically based upon historical delivery information  that conforms with the retailers growth objectives and their inventory needs 
this program incorporates freight and pricing discounts as incentives for the retailers to achieve their growth objectives formulated together by the retailers and the company s sales force 
the company believes that the expanded arp allows cannondale to maximize the competitive advantage of its flexible domestic manufacturing capabilities which provides the company with the ability to meet changes in market trends and demand rapidly

in july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
the eitf concluded that all shipping and handling billings to a customer in a sales transaction represent the revenue earned for the goods provided and  accordingly  should be classified as revenue 
currently  the company offsets shipping and handling charges billed to customers with the freight costs paid to carriers within selling  general and administrative expenses 
eitf issue will be effective for the company s fourth quarter of fiscal  adoption of this standard will have no impact on the net income or financial position of the company 
the euro

between january  and january   transactions may be conducted in either the euro or the participating countries national currency 
however  by july   the participating countries will withdraw their national currency as legal tender and complete the conversion to the euro 
the company conducts business in europe and does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material adverse effect on its competitive position or consolidated financial position 
the company has completed the necessary system modifications that allow the company to conduct business in both the euro as well as the participating countries national currency 
certain factors which may affect the company s future performance 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  the following statements regarding the state of the bicycle industry and the growth opportunity pursued by the company with its motorsports products  statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s capital and current operational investments to finance its future growth  statements regarding the company s expected cash needs and sources of cash to fund its planned operating and capital requirements  statements regarding the impact of the company s brand image  distribution  reputation and innovative products on the successful introduction of new products  statements regarding expected remediation and other costs relating to an environmental condition  statements regarding the effect of pending lawsuits on the company  statements regarding the impact of the euro conversion on computerized information systems  and statements regarding the condition of the company s present facilities and the ability of its present facilities to support its current and future production capacity 
such statements are based upon the facts presently known to the company and assumptions as to important future events  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
among the more important factors which could adversely affect actual results of operations are the following seasonality 
the company s results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including product mix  the timing and number of new retailer openings  the timing of shipments and new product introductions  and the effect of adverse weather conditions on consumer purchases 
in addition  the company s business is seasonal due to consumer spending patterns  which in turn affect dealer delivery preferences  and historically has resulted in more shipments and significantly stronger results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters january through june 
for fiscal  and  the company s operating results have deviated from this historical pattern 
the company s gross margins fluctuate primarily according to product mix  the cost of materials  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the timing of product price adjustments and markdowns 
although some operating expenses are variable with sales  most expenses are incurred evenly throughout the year 
the company in the past has incurred  and may in the future incur  operating losses in a fiscal quarter  as a result of the factors noted above 
introduction and market acceptance of new products 
the company s ability to return to the growth pattern that characterized its operations in recent years is dependent  to a significant degree  on its ability to successfully anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner  including the introduction of new or updated products at prices acceptable to customers 
while currently a substantial part of the company s sales are attributable to mountain and road bikes  the introduction of new product lines  particularly its motorsports products  will provide diversification of the company s products 
the company s ability to recover its investment and achieve profitability in its motorsports product lines will depend on its ability to generate market acceptance for these products 
in order to generate sufficient market acceptance  the company must increase consumer awareness of these products  establish a reputation for high quality and continue to develop a network of independent motorsports dealers to sell these products 
the company may incur significant costs in establishing such market acceptance 
competition 
competition in the high performance segment of the bicycle industry is based primarily on perceived value  brand image  performance features  product innovation and price 
competition in foreign markets may also be affected by duties  tariffs  taxes and the effect of various trade agreements  import restrictions and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the worldwide market for bicycles and accessories is extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers in each of its product lines 
a number of the company s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company 
the company competes on the basis of the breadth and quality of its product line  the development of an effective specialty retailer network and its brand recognition 
the motorsports market is also highly competitive 
the company s principal competitors are foreign manufacturers that have financial resources substantially greater than those of the company  that have established manufacturing capabilities  market and sell a product with strong brand recognition in the market and are more diversified than the company 
as a result of the foregoing  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully penetrate the motorsports market 
foreign exchange rates 
a substantial portion of the company s sales is generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
results of operations by these subsidiaries may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange ratio between the local currencies and the us dollar 
a substantial portion of the company s raw materials is purchased from overseas suppliers  accordingly  the gross margin of the company may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange ratio between the us dollar and the local currency of the supplier 
customer base 
sales of the company s products are made to specialty bicycle retailers  many of which are small businesses with limited capital 
the company s credit policies are designed to minimize the risks associated with business failures among such customers 
nevertheless  unpredictable matters such as poor weather could have a serious impact on important segments of the company s customer base 
for motorcycles  the company utilizes a third party financial services organization to finance dealer inventory purchases whereby the company receives payment from such organization for all motorcycle shipments within days  less an interest factor 
nonperformance by the financial services organization could result in a delay in the receipt of payments 
adverse weather 
the company s products are primarily used outdoors and therefore adverse weather conditions can have a negative impact on consumer demand 
reliance on key vendor and supplier relationships 
the company s ability to distribute its products on schedule is highly dependent on timely receipt of an adequate supply of components and materials 
the bicycles incorporate numerous components manufactured by other companies 
aluminum tubing  the primary material employed in the company s manufacturing operations  is available from a number of domestic suppliers 
the company has few long term agreements with its component manufacturers  and has no long term agreement with shimano  its largest single supplier  or with suppliers of many of the materials used in the manufacture of its products 
thus  the company s supply of materials and components from most of its current suppliers is not assured 
although the company believes it has established close relationships with the principal suppliers of these components  the company s future success will depend upon its ability to maintain flexible relationships  which may be terminated by such suppliers on short notice  or to substitute new suppliers without interruption of supply 
the loss of shimano or certain other key suppliers  or delays or disruptions in the delivery of components or materials  could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company has selected the suppliers that it will use to purchase the raw material parts and components for the manufacturing operations of its motorsports products 
during the process of identifying these vendors  the company has established strong relationships with key third party suppliers  however the company has not yet entered into any long term supply contracts 
generally  the raw material parts and components needed to manufacture its motorsports products are available from a variety of sources  however  manufacturing operations may be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected by delays in the supply of parts or components from third party suppliers 
even if parts and components are available from alternative sources  the company may be subject to increased costs and production delays in connection with the replacement of an existing third party supplier with one or more alternative suppliers 
limited motorsports product experience 
while the company believes that it can capitalize on many of its core competencies in producing its motorsports products  the company has limited experience in designing and manufacturing motorsports products 
this may lead to unforeseen expenses and delays in manufacturing and selling its motorsports products 
for example  although the company conducts significant testing of its motorsports products  these products could contain unforeseen defects 
these defects could result in costly product recalls  product liability claims and damage to the company s brand name 
in addition  the company may encounter significant difficulties and incur unforeseen expenses in manufacturing its motorsports products in commercial quantities and on a timely basis 
discretionary consumer spending 
purchases of bicycles and motorsports products  particularly the high performance models manufactured by the company  and the company s other products are discretionary for consumers 
the success of the company is influenced by a number of economic factors affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the company s growth and profitability 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends substantially on key personnel involved in research and development  marketing  sales  finance and administration 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key persons  particularly the loss of the services of joseph s 
montgomery  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
executive officers of the company and other management personnel frequently travel between the company s executive offices and its manufacturing facilities on an aircraft leased by the company 
an accident involving the corporate aircraft and any resulting injury or loss of life could have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address these risks  the company enters into various hedging transactions as described below 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
credit risks 
the company s customer base is composed of specialty bicycle retailers which are located principally throughout the united states and europe 
the company s net sales are concentrated in the united states and germany 
no other single country accounted for more than of the company s net sales during fiscal  or no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales during fiscal  or as a result of the seasonality of the company s business  the payment terms offered to its bicycle dealers generally range from to days depending on the time of year and other factors 
foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company enters into forward contracts to purchase and sell us  european  australian  canadian and japanese currencies to reduce exposures to foreign currency risk 
the company enters into forward foreign currency contracts for a significant portion of its current and net balance sheet exposures  principally relating to trade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  and firm sale and purchase commitments 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require the company to exchange  at maturity  various currencies for us dollars and euros at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
deferred gains and losses resulting from effective hedges of firm commitments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and are recognized in earnings when the offsetting gains and losses are recognized on the related transaction 
the net gains or losses explicitly deferred at july   july  and june  were not significant 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in earnings and offset the impact of valuing such receivables and payables 
discounts or premiums on such forward contracts are amortized over the respective contract lives 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions that do not satisfy the accounting requirements of an effective hedge are reported currently as other income or expense in the consolidated statement of operations
