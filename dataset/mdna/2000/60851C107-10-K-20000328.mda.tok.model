business business risks 
we are a leading developer of high performance  bioanalytical measurement systems that accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics and combinatorial chemistry by facilitating the high throughput cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
our instrument systems are based on our advanced core technologies which integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology and chemistry 
our systems are fundamental tools for drug discovery and life sciences research  and our maxline series of microplate readers and our flipr cell analysis systems are market share leaders in their respective markets 
our revenues were million in and have increased at a compound annual rate of since we typically invest to of our revenues in research and development  which has resulted in a track record of technological innovation 
over of our revenues in were derived from products that we introduced in the last three years 
we have sold over  instruments since the introduction of our first microplate reader in in addition  over customers have purchased our flipr systems since its introduction in  including the largest pharmaceutical companies  several of which own five or more flipr systems 
we expect that increased sales of recently introduced products  including gemini xs  flipr and clipr  and revenues from new instrument introductions will continue to drive our growth 
we also believe that the introduction of reagent kits optimized for our products represents a significant growth opportunity 
our customers include small and large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and industrial companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in we recognize revenue on the sale of our products at the time of shipment either directly to a customer or to a distributor 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
total service revenue was less than of total revenues for all periods presented 
in  sales to foreign countries accounted for of total revenues and total sales denominated in foreign currencies accounted for of total revenues 
we typically experience a decrease in the level of sales in the first calendar quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year because of budgetary and capital equipment purchasing patterns in the life sciences industry 
we expect this trend to continue in future years 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statement of income as a percentage of revenues years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development write off of acquired in process research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income pro forma net income excludes the impact of the write offs of acquired in process research and development recorded in and  net of tax 
years ended december   and revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this top line growth was driven by strong contributions from our maxline and cell analysis product families  partially offset by decreased performance of our threshold product family 
maxline revenues increased primarily due to the worldwide strength of the spectramax gemini as well as our newly acquired skatron liquid handling product line 
cell analysis growth was driven primarily by increased worldwide demand for new flipr products introduced in late  particularly flipr 
threshold revenues declined primarily as a result of decreased demand from military customers worldwide 
revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in all three product families showed increased levels of revenue in maxline revenues increased due to both greater sales of the new spectramax products  including the spectramax plus  spectramax and spectramax gemini  and increased penetration of maxline products into our european distribution channels 
cell analysis revenues increased due to both the introduction of flipr and increased demand for other flipr products worldwide 
threshold revenues increased due to greater volume shipments to military customers worldwide 
gross margin increased to in from in and in both year to year increases relate to increased sales of higher margin products in both the maxline and cell analysis product families  primarily the spectramax gemini and flipr 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in and by in compared to approximately million in the increased spending for both periods is primarily the result of additional personnel as well as increased expenditures on development activities required to support both the introduction and on going development of new maxline and cell analysis products 
we recorded a charge of  during the second quarter of due to the write off of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of skatron 
we recorded an  charge during the third quarter of due to the write off of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of technology rights from affymax research institute  a subsidiary of glaxo wellcome 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in and by in compared to approximately million in the increased spending for both periods is primarily the result of additional spending on marketing  sales and service related activities including additional personnel as we continued our efforts to expand worldwide market coverage and introduce new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in  in and in  reflecting improved operating leverage as our revenue base has grown 
other income net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by in to approximately million from approximately million in due to a decreased average cash balance primarily as a result of the skatron acquisition 
other income net increased by in to approximately million from approximately million in due to greater interest income earned resulting from higher average cash balances 
we recorded income tax provisions of approximately million in  million in and million in these provisions reflected a effective tax rate in and as compared to a effective tax rate in the higher effective tax rate for and reflects decreased tax benefits from our foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  compared to million at december  we have typically financed operations primarily from cash flows provided by operating activities  which contributed approximately million in  million in and million in cash provided by operations in these years was primarily reflective of our earnings as offset by short term working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
our requirements for inventory in  in particular  were greater than in previous years as a result of the skatron acquisition as well as the ramp up of production of new cell analysis systems 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in  million in and  in  and was used primarily for capital expenditures  except for when approximately million of cash was used for the acquisition of skatron 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in and  in while net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the and proceeds relate primarily to stock option exercises 
the use of funds in reflects repayment of a million promissory note related to the acquisition of noveltech  partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress of our research and development  the number and scope of our research programs  market acceptance and demand for our products  the costs that may be involved in enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities  manufacturing capacity requirements  and the costs of expanding our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities both in the united states and abroad 
we have generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital requirements since our initial public offering in however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing in the future to support our existing operations or potential acquisition and technology licensing opportunities that may arise 
therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
impact of year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we expensed year remediation costs as incurred 
there were no significant incremental costs incurred 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year so that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
recent pronouncement in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  referred to as sab sab summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
we are currently in the process of evaluating sab and what effect it may have on our financial statements 
accordingly  we have not determined whether sab will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial institutions is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities  consisting of commercial paper and us government agency securities  are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within days  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  germany and canada 
all export sales  with the exception of sales into canada  are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions in canada have historically been immaterial 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
those gains and losses have historically been immaterial
