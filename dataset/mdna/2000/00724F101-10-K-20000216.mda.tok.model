revenue change change revenue  revenue is categorized into four major operating segments web publishing  print publishing  epaper solutions  and oem postscript and other 
the web publishing  print publishing  and epaper solutions segments include application products revenue that is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail  var  and oem distribution channels 
the oem postscript and other segment includes licensing revenue  which is made up of royalties received from oem customers who ship products containing adobe s postscript technology  and includes revenue from divested businesses 
revenue from the web publishing segment is derived primarily from the sale of the following application products adobe photoshop  adobe premiere  after effects  golive  adobe photodeluxe  adobe web collection  adobe dynamic media collection  pagemill  imagestyler  and activeshare 
print publishing revenue comes primarily from the sale of the following application products adobe illustrator  pagemaker  indesign  framemaker  adobe publishing collection  adobe design collection  adobe type manager  adobe type library  pressready  adobe font folio  incopy  adobe dimensions  and streamline 
the epaper solutions segment is derived from the sale of adobe acrobat software and other acrobat related technologies 
for further information regarding our operating segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  overall revenue increased compared to fiscal  due to increased licensing of products in the print publishing  epaper solutions  and web publishing segments 
excluding revenue from businesses divested in the third quarter of fiscal  revenue increased 
the print publishing segment provided the majority of the fiscal revenue growth  with a increase from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from this segment was primarily due to increased licensing of our publishing collection product and the introduction of indesign  a new page layout application software product  in the second half of fiscal the increase in revenue from these products was partially offset by a decline in revenue from pagemaker  illustrator  and framemaker  primarily due to product lifecycle timing 
additional revenue growth was achieved through our epaper solutions segment  as revenue more than doubled compared to the prior year  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to the release of acrobat in the second quarter of the year  with a higher number of units licensed as a result of growing customer adoption of adobe acrobat and adobe portable document format pdf technology 
the web publishing segment also contributed to the revenue growth as it grew in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the release of golive  our new internet application software product introduced in the first half of fiscal in addition  this segment experienced continued strength in the licensing of our digital imaging and dynamic media products  with the release of photoshop  after effects  and adobe premiere in the first half of fiscal  as well as increased revenue from our adobe web collection and dynamic media collection products 
the increase in revenue from this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from adobe photodeluxe  due to reduced pricing  and a decline in revenue from pagemill  due to product lifecycle timing 
the increase in revenue in fiscal in the above operating segments was partially offset by a decline in revenue from the oem postscript and other segment of million  or  compared to fiscal oem postscript licensing revenue has experienced a decline over the past three years  primarily due to the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors loss of royalty revenue from hewlett packard company s hp desktop monochrome laser printer division  which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript software into its products since the fall of  a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers  and an increase in the use of inkjet printers  resulting in the weakness in the monochrome laser printer market 
in addition  in fiscal  we received million in revenue in this segment from businesses we divested in the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in a decline of revenue in fiscal from the absence of these businesses 
we continue to be cautious about revenue from our oem postscript and other segment because of the continuing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market and the uncertain timing of oem customer introductions of products incorporating adobe s latest technologies 
excluding our investments in our high end color printing technologies  we anticipate that revenue from our oem postscript and other segment will continue to decline in fiscal total revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to adverse economic conditions in japan and a decline in revenue from our print publishing and oem postscript and other segments 
the print publishing segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to a decline in revenue from our pagemaker  framemaker  and adobe type manager products  none of which had upgrades released during the year  and a decline in revenue from our illustrator product as its latest upgrade was not released until late in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in this segment from the above products was partially offset by an increase in our adobe publishing collection product  which was introduced in the us and asia in fiscal additionally  the oem postscript and other segment experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to weakness in the japanese personal computer and printer markets  as well as the reduction in royalty revenue from hp s desktop monochrome laser printer division 
the decline in revenue in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in the epaper solutions and web publishing segments 
the epaper solutions segment grew from fiscal  due to increased demand for acrobat additionally  the web publishing segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of the release of our photoshop and adobe premiere products 
overall  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform increased by in fiscal over fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased by while revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform decreased during the same period 
in both fiscal and fiscal  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of application products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal we expect the platform mix to remain relatively the same in the foreseeable future 
direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue we reclassified certain direct costs and operating expenses in the fiscal and consolidated statements of income to conform to the fiscal presentation 
these reclassifications did not impact total operating profit for fiscal or direct costs include product packaging  third party royalties  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
direct costs decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to more effective inventory management  resulting in lower excess and obsolete inventory  as well as lower unit cost of materials as a result of our ongoing cost improvement program 
direct costs decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to lower packaging costs and our full transition from distribution of our products on disk to cd rom media 
direct costs also decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as certain acquired technologies became fully amortized and we incurred lower product localization costs 
as a result of the impact of ongoing cost improvement programs  we have targeted gross margin to be approximately throughout fiscal operating expenses we reclassified certain direct costs and operating expenses in the fiscal and consolidated statements of income to conform to the fiscal presentation 
these reclassifications did not impact total operating profit for fiscal or research and development change change research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to higher incentive compensation expenses primarily associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over fiscal and higher incentive compensation targets 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in salaries as a result of lower headcount and decreases in general office expenses and professional fees as a result of our fiscal restructuring program and other cost reduction efforts implemented at that time 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the expansion of our engineering staff and related costs required to support our continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products 
the increase also reflects our increased investments in new technologies  new product development  and the infrastructure to support such activities 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was partially offset by certain cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program that was implemented during the third quarter of fiscal we also reduced outside labor costs and professional fees by discontinuing certain research and development programs 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of our application software products  including those targeted for the growing internet market 
we expect that research and development expenses for fiscal will increase in absolute dollars 
we have targeted such expenditures to be approximately of revenue in fiscal sales and marketing change change sales and marketing percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations  and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses primarily associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over the prior year and higher incentive compensation targets 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased year over year  due to increased advertising  promotional  and trade show expenses associated with new product releases 
the increase was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented during the third quarter of fiscal that eliminated certain brand advertising campaigns and other marketing activities related to the divestiture of a business 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to higher employee costs  increased customer support costs  and increased marketing and advertising activities 
higher commissions were also paid as a result of increased headcount and growth in application products revenue compared to fiscal additionally  sales and marketing expenses included higher outside labor costs to support user education related to new product releases and for the development of our web site 
these increased expenses were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented during the third quarter of fiscal we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support investments in ebusiness and enhanced marketing activities 
for fiscal  our sales and marketing expense target is approximately of revenue 
general and administrative change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for the finance  human resources  legal  information services  and executive personnel of adobe 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year  reflecting the savings related to the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal and additionally  the decrease is attributable to decreased legal fees and lower bad debt expense 
these decreases were offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense primarily associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over the prior year and higher incentive compensation targets 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to increased expenses for outside legal and investment banking services associated with responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal as well as increased employee costs and related depreciation and building expenses associated with increased staff 
bad debt expense was also higher in fiscal to reserve for accounts receivable from certain customers that were deemed potentially uncollectible 
these increased expenses were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented in the third quarter of fiscal that included a reduction in general office and other administrative expenses 
we expect that general and administrative spending will remain flat or slightly increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support ongoing administrative infrastructure needs 
however  we have targeted such expenditures to decrease as a percentage of revenue to approximately in fiscal restructuring and other charges change change restructuring and other charges na percentage of total revenue during fiscal and  we implemented three different board approved restructuring programs 
these unique restructuring programs were directly focused on improving our competitive position as well as enhancing adobe s allocation of resources 
in addition to these three restructurings  we also implemented restructuring programs in fiscal and related to the aldus corporation aldus and frame technology corporation frame acquisitions 
as of december   there was no restructuring liability remaining for restructuring programs prior to fiscal fiscal restructuring programs the fourth quarter restructuring program was implemented to enhance our worldwide customer support activity and to streamline the product distribution and warehouse operations in north america 
the program resulted in a reduction in force of positions and the closure of the north american distribution warehouse as a result of the decision to outsource our north american distribution and warehousing operations and the majority of our customer support 
the reduction in force primarily affected employees in seattle  washington and santa clara  california 
total charges incurred as a result of the restructuring were million  which include severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges for vacating leased facilities 
the other restructuring program  implemented in the second and third quarters  was directly related to the centralization of our worldwide sales and administrative organizations and the realignment of our printing solutions business 
the program included a reduction in force of positions  two of which were executive positions 
the reduction in force primarily affected our european headquarters in edinburgh  scotland and our north american headquarters in san jose  california 
total charges incurred as a result of the restructuring were million  of which approximately million were noncash charges 
this restructuring was completed in the third quarter of fiscal in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we revised our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring program implemented during the second and third quarters described above  resulting in an adjustment to the restructuring accrual of approximately million 
approximately million of the adjustment reflects lower than estimated severance and related charges primarily attributable to employees impacted by the restructuring who were able to find alternative employment within adobe 
the remaining adjustment was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
we also recorded adjustments during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal related to prior year restructuring programs in the amount of million 
for detailed information regarding the adjustments and our restructuring programs  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal restructuring program the restructuring program was implemented to refocus our product development efforts and to eliminate management redundancies in the organization 
as part of the restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in force of positions  four of which were executive positions  primarily in our north american and corporate operations 
the reductions came predominantly from overhead areas  divested business units  and redundant marketing activities  and as of august   the majority of these terminations were completed 
in addition to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force of positions  the restructuring program included charges for divesting two business units  vacating leased facilities  and canceling certain contracts 
these actions and other nonrestructuring related items resulted in charges of million  of which approximately million were noncash charges 
during fiscal  we experienced savings of approximately million from the fiscal restructuring program as a result of the reductions in force  as well as reductions in marketing  facilities  and other discretionary expenses  such as travel and outside services 
we also experienced savings of approximately million as a result of the restructuring programs implemented during fiscal  which  on an annualized basis  equate to approximately million 
we believe that the savings realized under the restructuring programs will be invested in programs and people to enhance revenue growth by significantly increasing our investment in ebusiness and enhanced marketing activities 
we also believe that these savings will assist us in achieving our operating model targets of   and of revenue for research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  respectively  in fiscal other charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded other charges of million that were unusual in nature 
these charges included million associated with the cancellation of a contract  and million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program 
additionally  we incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling million for a terminated employee  and we incurred consulting fees of million to assist in the restructuring of our operations 
in fiscal  restructuring and other charges included a million charge related to the acquisition of intellectual property 
this charge was offset by a million gain related to the divestiture of a product line 
acquired in process research and development change change acquired in process research and development na na percentage of total revenue acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal is comprised of million and million associated with the acquisitions of attitude software  llc attitude software and photomerge technology photomerge  respectively 
the following is a summary of the projects acquired in the acquisitions and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in process research and development costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we acquired substantially all of the assets  consisting of intellectual property  of attitude software 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  and substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition 
the ongoing project at attitude software at the time of the purchase included the development of the d anarchy authoring product 
we purchase this technology to incorporate it into future versions of our existing adobe products to further enhance the feature sets and user interface contained within the products 
at the date we acquired attitude software  it was estimated that of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately months to complete and would cost million 
the efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily relate to additional design efforts to integrate the technologies into several of adobe s products  finalization of coding  and completion testing 
the value of the in process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products the technology will be integrated into  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products  excluding the value attributed to the existing technology with the products prior to the integration of the purchased technology 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of  exclusive of the value attributable to the use of the in process technologies in future products 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets  consisting of intellectual property  of photomerge 
in connection with the acquisition of photomerge  of the purchase price  or  cash  was allocated to in process research and development due to the state of completion and the uncertainty of the technology 
during fiscal  we acquired three software companies  in separate transactions  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of the acquisitions 
one of the in process technologies acquired for million was discontinued in fiscal the project associated with an additional million of the purchased in process technology was canceled as part of the restructuring in the third quarter of fiscal and was subsequently sold to a management led buyout group 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles change change amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles percentage of total revenue amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in fiscal primarily relates to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of golive systems  inc and a related partnership together golive systems in january for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was higher than fiscal as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal and remaining amortization related to the merger with aldus in fiscal nonoperating income change change investment gain percentage of total revenue investment gain consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark to market valuation adjustments for investments held by adobe incentive partners  lp aip 
in fiscal  we recorded a realized gain of million related to the sale of our investment in vignette corporation 
we also recorded investment gains from mark to market adjustments totaling million  million  and million related to investments in electronic submission publishing systems  inc  digitalthink  inc  and tumbleweed communications corporation  respectively 
these gains were partially offset by an investment loss of million related to the acquisition of pointcast  inc  a former investee of the company  by idealab s launchpad technologies  inc idealab 
in connection with the acquisition  we exchanged our shares of pointcast  inc for approximately  shares of idealab since then has become entrypoint inc 
additionally  we recorded a net gain totaling million related to mark to market adjustments of various other adobe venture investments 
in fiscal  we recorded a realized gain of million related to our investment in mcqueen international limited mcqueen  due to the acquisition of mcqueen by sykes enterprises  incorporated sykes  a publicly traded company 
in addition  we liquidated our investment in siebel systems  incorporated siebel through the distribution to our stockholders of approximately  shares of siebel common stock as a dividend in kind and the sale of our remaining siebel shares 
a gain was recognized on the transaction of approximately million 
the remaining net realized gain recorded in fiscal represents valuation adjustments related to our venture investments held by aip 
in fiscal  the investment gain related primarily to the liquidation of our investment in netscape communications corporation netscape through the distribution to its stockholders of  shares of netscape common stock as a dividend in kind and the sale of our remaining netscape shares 
we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
interest and other income change change interest and other income percentage of total revenue interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets 
the decrease in interest and other income over the past three years is due to lower average cash and short term investment balances  primarily as a result of cash used for stock repurchases 
in addition  during fiscal more investments were made in tax exempt securities resulting in lower interest income on a comparative pre tax basis 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal was partially offset by a million gain realized from the sale of a corporate facility in edinburgh  scotland in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal interest income is expected to decrease in fiscal due to lower average cash balances resulting from stock repurchases conducted in fiscal further  our cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal due to continuing stock repurchases and the purchase of software companies  products  or technologies that are complementary to our business 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible goodwill amortization 
our effective tax rate increased in fiscal from fiscal principally as a result of the nondeductible write off of goodwill and lower tax exempt interest income 
we have targeted our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal to approximately 
factors that may affect future results of operations we believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors  including delays in shipment of our new products and major new versions of existing products lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades introduction of new products by major competitors weakness in demand for application software and printers renegotiation of royalty arrangements lack of growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales  and downward sales price adjustments consolidation in the oem printer business ongoing weakness in our printing business due to product transitions industry transitions to new business and information delivery models adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business year issues as discussed later under year issues we have stated that in fiscal our annual revenue growth target is over fiscal revenue and that our gross margin and operating profit margin targets are and  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal  our operating model targets for research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses are   and of revenue  respectively  and our effective tax rate target is 
we use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels  and geographic distribution these and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from these targets 
our ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have an impact on our results of operations 
our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions  whether by us or by our oem customers  could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings  or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
the market for our graphics applications  particularly our consumer and web publishing products  is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
additionally  microsoft corporation microsoft has increased its presence in the digital imaging graphics market  we believe that  due to microsoft s market dominance  any new microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with our products 
if competing new products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results would suffer 
we generally offer our application and server based products on macintosh  windows  unix  and linux platforms 
to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platforms or in general  our business could be harmed 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  and retailers collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from a single distributor 
we are in the process of revising our channel program to reduce the overall number of our distributors worldwide and focus our channel efforts on larger distributors 
this revision of the channel program has resulted in an increase in our dependence on a smaller number of distributors selling through a larger amount of our products 
additionally  our goal is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our web site atwww 
adobe 
com 
any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online  internet based resellers of our products 
while we anticipate that the restructuring and streamlining of our product distribution channels and the increase in the scope of our direct sales efforts will eventually improve our business by decreasing discounts or rebate programs provided to distributors  decreasing product returns  and shortening inventory cycles  these changes could instead seriously harm our business 
in addition  we continue to expand into third party distribution channels  including value added resellers and systems integrators  in our effort to further broaden our customer base 
as a result  the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success 
some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate 
also  as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the corporate business and consumer markets  we may not successfully adapt our application software distribution channels  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
we could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business 
we currently rely on three manufacturers of our products  each located in a different region  one of these has just been added in the first quarter of fiscal if a manufacturer terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a manufacturer is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that manufacturer to avoid harm to our business 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in revenue from the licensing of postscript technology 
we expect this trend to continue and believe that our financial results could be harmed by it 
the weakness in the monochrome laser printer and japanese markets were factors causing the revenue decline 
in addition  in the fall of fiscal  hp began to ship a clone version of adobe postscript technology in some printers  resulting in lower licensing revenue to us in fiscal and even though we continue to work with hp printer operations to incorporate adobe postscript and other technologies into other hp products  we expect continued lower revenue in this segment from hp in fiscal if other significant customers also decide to incorporate a clone version instead of adobe postscript technology  it could seriously harm our business 
further  oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
we evaluate these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for us 
from the end of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a decline in revenue from the japanese market due to a weak japanese computer market and general economic conditions in japan 
during the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  we experienced an increase in application revenue from our japanese operation but still continued to experience a decline in oem postscript and other revenue 
in addition  at the end of fiscal  inventory levels for application products at our japanese distributors remained higher than what we consider normal 
during fiscal  we worked with our major distributors in japan to reduce channel inventory to what we consider a reasonable level 
despite the slight improvement in the japanese economy in the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  these adverse economic conditions may continue in the short term  and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
although there are also adverse conditions in other asian and latin american economies  the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results 
we recently implemented restructurings of our business in the second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  resulting in a workforce reduction of 
however  we plan to continue to invest in certain areas  which will require us to hire additional employees 
competition for high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively  otherwise our business could be seriously harmed 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing authoring and communications over the internet is young and has few proven products 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been finally adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
we have stated that we intend to increase our investment in ebusiness and enhanced marketing activities in an effort to achieve revenue growth  but we can provide no assurance that this increased investment in this new market will result in increased revenue 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our subsidiaries located in europe  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
we generally experience lower revenue from our european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months 
additionally  we are uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in the japan  asia pacific  and latin america markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions 
while most of the revenue of our european subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the majority of our revenue derived from japan is denominated in yen  and the majority of all our subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the financial impact of such fluctuations has not been significant 
our hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
we have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen 
our hedging program is not comprehensive  and our program may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been and may in the future be subject to complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended past litigation  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation 
adverse decisions in such litigation could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to software revenue recognition purchase and pooling of interests accounting for business combinations the valuation of in process research and development employee stock purchase plans stock option grants have recently been revised or are under review by one or more groups 
changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
due to the factors noted earlier  as well as the year issues noted later  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings compared to analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has caused in the past  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry  and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price 
year issues we have been addressing a broad range of issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approached 
the year problem is complex  as many computer systems have been affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for us from unforeseen problems in our products or our own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom we deal on financial and other transactions worldwide 
failure of our and or third parties computer systems or year defects in our products could harm our ability to conduct our business 
we commenced a phased program to inventory  assess  remediate  test  implement  and develop contingency plans for all mission critical applications and products potentially affected by the year issue the yk program 
all phases have been substantially completed  including proactive testing and monitoring in the early part of the year all of our business groups were involved in the yk program efforts 
we identified three potential areas of impact for review the software and systems  including embedded systems  used in our internal business processes  third party vendors  manufacturers and suppliers  and our software products offered to customers 
we estimate that the aggregate cost incurred for the yk program was less than million  which we funded from operating cash flows 
internal business processes 
we have substantially completed all phases of our yk program related to our internal business processes  including proactive monitoring and testing of these processes during the early part of year in addition  in order to protect against the acquisition of additional products that may not be year ready  we implemented a policy requiring year review of products or upgrades sold or licensed to us prior to their acquisition 
through january  we have not discovered any material issues 
however  as it is still early in the year  such failures  or the failure of any contingency plan  remain a possibility  and it could seriously harm our business if significant new noncompliance issues are identified 
third party vendors  manufacturers  and suppliers 
both before and after the year date change  we contacted our critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors  and other vendors to determine whether their operations and the products and services that they provide to us are year compliant 
through january  we have not discovered any material issues 
however  as it is still early in the year  such failures or the failure of any contingency plan remain a possibility and could seriously harm our business 
products 
in addition  the year issue could affect the products that we license 
we are currently continuing to test our products and gather information about our technologies and products affected by the year transition 
current information about our products is available on our year web site www 
adobe 
com newsfeatures year 
information on our web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of assisting in the transition to the year such information is the most currently available concerning our products and is provided as is without warranty of any kind 
we can provide no assurance that our current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year issues that may result in material costs to us 
contingency plans 
our yk program was designed to minimize the possibility of serious year interruptions 
however  because the possibility of such interruptions could not be eliminated  we developed contingency plans addressing year issues in our high impact areas and for other areas as we deemed practicable and advisable 
such plans for high impact processes continue to be revised and updated based on current information  even after the start of the year  particularly in light of our internal ongoing process and structural changes 
other contingency plans were prepared  tested  and updated as we deemed practicable and appropriate 
we continue to expect to have personnel and resources available to deal with any year problems that occur 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise from year compliance issues  and we are aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent we may be affected by it  and the impact and cost of such litigation is therefore not estimable 
the impact of the year on our future revenue is difficult to discern but is a risk to be considered in evaluating our future growth 
any costs associated with potential year litigation exposure are not included in the total cost estimate above 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amends sop and supersedes sop sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element software arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and recognized in accordance with sop we will adopt sop in fiscal  and we do not expect this to have a significant impact on us 
in march  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of developing computer software intended for internal use 
we must adopt sop effective as of fiscal  and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  which defers the implementation of sfas we will be required to implement sfas in fiscal year we have not determined the impact that sfas will have on our financial statements and we believe that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
liquidity and capital resources change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consist principally of money market mutual funds  municipal bonds  and united states government agency securities 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased million  or  in fiscal  primarily due to cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million  and the release of restricted funds totaling million associated with the refinancing of our corporate headquarters lease agreement 
other sources of cash include the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the sale of a building in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in addition  short term investments increased due to a reclassification of million of investments classified as long term to short term as well as mark to market adjustments totaling million 
these factors were partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock in the amount of million  capital expenditures of million  the purchase of other assets for million  the purchase of the assets of golive systems and attitude software for million  and the payment of dividends totaling million 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including expenditures for computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and acquire software companies  products  or technologies that are complementary to our business 
in september  adobe s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
we repurchased approximately million shares in the first quarter of fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal  at a cost of million  million  and million  respectively 
this program was completed during the first quarter of fiscal in april  adobe s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the purchase of up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
this new stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program whereby we have been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
no purchases have been made under the million share repurchase program 
under our existing plan to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans  we repurchased approximately million  million  and million shares in fiscal   and  respectively  at a cost of million  million  and million  respectively 
we have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of adobe s board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal   and on december   we dividended one share of siebel common stock for each shares of adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on october  an equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than  adobe shares and for odd lot and fractional siebel shares 
also  in fiscal  we dividended one share of netscape common stock for each shares of adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on july  an equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than  adobe shares and for fractional netscape shares 
the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of adobe s board of directors and will depend on business conditions  our results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
to facilitate our stock repurchase program  we sold put warrants in a series of private placements in fiscal   and each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of our common stock to us at a specified price 
approximately million  million  and million put warrants were written in fiscal   and  respectively 
at december   approximately million put warrants were outstanding that expire on various dates through april and have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
in addition  in fiscal   and  we purchased call options that entitle us to buy million  million  and million shares  respectively  of our common stock 
at december   approximately million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through april and have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
under these arrangements  at our option  we can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
commitments our principal commitments as of december  consisted of obligations under operating leases  a line of credit agreement  venture investing activities  real estate development agreements  and various service agreements 
in fiscal and  we entered into real estate development agreements and operating lease agreements in connection with the construction of two corporate headquarters office facilities in san jose  california 
the operating lease agreement for the first office building commenced in  and the operating lease agreement for the second facility commenced in in august  we restructured these two lease agreements for our corporate headquarters 
the amended and restated agreement replaces the two prior lease agreements commencing in and  respectively 
the lease is for a period of five years and is subject to standard covenants including financial ratios 
we have an option to purchase the buildings at any time during the term for an amount equal to the total investment of the lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may exercise the purchase option or  with the mutual agreement of the lessor  renew the term of the lease 
in addition to these possibilities  at the end of the term  we may elect to have the buildings sold to an unrelated third party 
in such case  we are obligated to use our best efforts to arrange for such a sale and are obligated to pay the lessor the difference between the total investment in the buildings and the net sales proceeds  provided  however  that in no event would we be required to pay more than a maximum guaranteed residual amount as set forth in the lease 
in the event we default during the term of the lease  the lessor could require us to purchase the buildings for an amount equal to our option price 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
during  we entered into a real estate development agreement for the construction of an office building in edinburgh  scotland 
during fiscal and  we paid approximately million for land  fees  and construction costs 
during fiscal  we announced a board approved restructuring which resulted in the reduction in workforce primarily in our european headquarters in edinburgh  scotland 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the restructuring  the decision was made by management to sell the new facility in edinburgh  and the sale was completed in september we received million cash from the sale of the facility and realized a gain upon the sale of million 
as of december   we had no commitments related to this building 
in august  we entered into a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a group of banks for general corporate purposes  subject to certain financial covenants 
one half of the facility expires in august  and the other million expires in august outstanding balances accrue interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that is based on our financial ratios 
there were no outstanding balances on the credit facility as of december  in addition  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we believe that if the line of credit is canceled or amounts are not available under the line  there would not be a material adverse effect on our financial results  liquidity  or capital resources 
under the terms of the line of credit and the lease agreement  we may pay cash dividends unless an event of default has occurred or we do not meet certain financial ratios 
derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in europe  where we license primarily in us dollars 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen denominated licenses in japan 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased options 
at december   total outstanding contracts included million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased japanese yen put option contracts with a notional value of million 
all contracts expire at various times through december our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
we recognize gains and losses associated with the mark to market of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  as income in the current period 
corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized as income in that same period 
in this manner  the gains and losses on foreign currency denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency contracts 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these instruments 
we use yen options to hedge anticipated exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in europe 
instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenue from product upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge european currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus  or plus basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the market value changes for a   or basis point increase in short term treasury security yields were not material due to the limited duration of our portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to one issue  issuer  as well as the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  we do not expect the exposure to market and credit risk to be material 
facility leases we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of our facilities whose payments are tied to the libor and have evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the libor rate 
market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the libor curve of plus or minus   and basis points for a twelve month period 
based on this analysis  such charges would not be material to our results of operations or financial position
