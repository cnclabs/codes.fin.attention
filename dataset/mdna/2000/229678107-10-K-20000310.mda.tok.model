overview since our incorporation on may  and commencement of operations in february  we have been engaged in the research  development and commercialization of novel antimicrobial drugs to combat serious and life threatening bacterial and fungal infections  including those caused by bacteria and fungi resistant to commercially available drugs 
we have a limited history of operations and have experienced significant net losses since inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next several years and expect cumulative losses to increase due to expanded research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trials and the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
in recent years we have enhanced our drug discovery and development programs and funded a portion of our capital requirements  by entering into collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we have entered into collaborative agreements based specifically on our aminoacyl trna synthetase program with merck and bristol myers squibb  and a collaborative agreement with novartis based on our vita functional genomics technology 
under these collaborative agreements  we have received sponsored research payments and  if drug development milestones are achieved  we are entitled to milestone payments 
in addition  we will be entitled to receive royalties on worldwide sales of any drug developed and commercialized from these collaborations 
we have received all of the sponsored research payments that we were entitled to under our collaborative agreements with merck and bristol meyers squibb  although merck and bristol myers squibb are still required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to us for any drug developed and commercialized from these collaborations 
on february   we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with novartis pharma ag to use our vita functional genomics technology to validate and develop assays for antimicrobial targets and to identify new compounds for development as antimicrobial agents

in addition  we will be required to pay royalties to eli lilly on worldwide sales of daptomycin 
on february   we issued to eli lilly  shares of our common stock as a milestone payment which was due upon commencement of phase iii clinical trials of daptomycin 
the value of the common stock issued was  and was recorded as research and development expense 
in january  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with dsm fine chemicals bv pursuant to which dsm has agreed to manufacture and supply to us bulk daptomycin drug substance for commercial purposes 
under the terms of the memorandum of understanding  dsm is required to prepare its manufacturing facility in italy to manufacture bulk daptomycin drug substance in accordance with good manufacturing practices standards  and we will make a series of scheduled payments to dsm over a five year period beginning in in order to reimburse dsm for up to million of the costs to be incurred by dsm in connection with the preparation  testing and validation of its manufacturing facility 
in addition  we have agreed to make milestone payments to dsm if specific phases of the preparation of its manufacturing facility are completed within specified periods of time 
the maximum amount of milestone payments that we may be required to make to dsm is million 
upon completion of the preparation of dsm s manufacturing facility and a determination by the fda that the manufacturing facility complies with good manufacturing practices standards  we will purchase minimum annual quantities of bulk daptomycin drug substance from dsm over a five year period beginning in results of operations years ended december  and revenues

recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was amended by sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which is effective no later than the quarter ending march  sab clarifies the sec s views related to revenue recognition and disclosure 
we will adopt sab effective in the first quarter of and are presently determining the effect it will have on our financial statements  but management does not believe the effect will be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
our investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
