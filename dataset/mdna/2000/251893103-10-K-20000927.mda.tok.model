fiscal year ended june   vs 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal was another year of record financial performance 
tuition revenues in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal the increase in tuition revenue was produced by higher enrollments tuition rate increases at devry institutes  keller graduate school of management and becker conviser cpa review 
fiscal marked the th consecutive year at devry institutes in which cumulative total student enrollment for the three semesters during the year has increased  up from the previous year 
enrollment increases at devry institutes reflect the opening of a new campus in west hills  california  continued enrollment increases in previously opened sites  and enrollments at denver technical college s two colorado campuses  which were acquired in july at keller graduate school  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by compared with fiscal  reflecting the opening of five new teaching centers during the year and enrollment growth at previously opened centers  including the online education center 
at becker conviser cpa review  the july acquisition of the conviser duffy cpa review operations increased enrollments to more than  per year 
tuition revenues also increased because of tuition rate increases of approximately at devry institutes  which occurred in the spring semester of fiscal and that were in effect throughout fiscal  and somewhat lesser increases at keller graduate school and becker conviser cpa review during the current fiscal year 
at devry institutes  tuition increases have historically been implemented effective with the spring term that begins in march 
in fiscal  the tuition increase was realigned to become effective with the start of the summer term  which corresponds with the beginning of the new financial aid year and is consistent with the pattern of devry institutes high school recruiting program 
as a result  the company s tuition revenues in march and for the fourth fiscal quarter were almost million lower than they would have been if the historical tuition increase pattern had applied 
other educational revenues  composed primarily of sales of books  supplies  other educational materials and interest charges on devry institutes outstanding student receivables  increased by million  or  because of the increased number of students attending the company s education programs 
contributing further to the increase were growing sales of the becker conviser cd rom product and other cpa review study materials acquired in july with conviser duffy 
the devry institutes have entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett to manage several of the on campus institute bookstores and also to provide internet order capability to students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett should provide an improved level of service to devry institute students 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing four institute bookstores and began managing a fifth store in july 
the institutes will receive a commission from follett based upon the level of sales at these campuses 
responsibility for managing additional devry institute campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  reducing reported revenues but with no significant effect on net income 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances increased slightly to million because of somewhat higher cash balances held during the year  although at fiscal year end  cash balances were lower than they were last year 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin provides the sec staff s views on applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues  including the recognition of fee income 
the principles outlined in this bulletin are subject to further detailed guidance on application 
current implementation dates require the application of sab no later than the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year the company derives most of its revenues from tuition charges that are appropriately recognized ratably over the academic term 
application fees and other similar charges  which currently represent less than of total revenue  are recognized as revenue at the time application processing and testing services are provided 
the company is awaiting the sec s release of further guidance with respect to sab and then will complete the process of evaluating the full effects of this pronouncement 
sab requires the deferral of certain fees and other charges over the period of service student enrollment  however  based on a preliminary analysis  the company does not expect sab to have a significant effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or  from the previous year 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore sales  other student education related support activities and the cost of tuition refunds and uncollectible student accounts 
the acquisition of the denver technical college and conviser duffy operations added both revenue and expense this year 
however  higher wage  benefit  supply  service and facility expenses associated with the growing number of students and the expanded number of operating locations at devry institutes and keller graduate school contributed the greatest portion of the increase in cost 
new operating locations  such as devry institute s west hills  california  campus opened in november and the new keller graduate school centers opened during the year  typically incur expenses greater than their revenues during the first year of operation 
depreciation expense  included in the cost of educational services  increased by million  or  from fiscal as a result of record spending during the past several years on capital improvements and systemwide expansion 
provision for refunds and uncollectible accounts at devry institutes  although higher in absolute amount than last year  decreased as a percentage of tuition revenue from fiscal this is believed to result from higher admission standards  increased academic support and student service quality initiatives that favorably affect student retention and contribute to increased operating margins 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending primarily reflects marketing costs associated with generating higher student enrollments at devry institutes  keller graduate school and becker conviser cpa review for terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal  which began in july 
marketing and administrative expenses associated with the denver technical college and conviser duffy operations also contributed to the year s increased costs  but economies were achieved from the combination of their operations with devry institutes and becker cpa review  respectively 
marketing costs were also incurred for the new devry institute in tinley park  illinois  opened in july  and for the new devry institute in orlando  florida  scheduled to open in november all marketing costs are expensed as incurred  and the level of spending reflects efforts toward student enrollments  revenues from which will not be realized until future periods 
amortization expense of intangible assets  primarily resulting from goodwill created by purchase accounting on the company s acquisitions  is included in the student services and administrative expense category 
in fiscal  this expense equaled million  increasing by approximately million from last year because of the acquisitions of denver technical college and conviser duffy 
administrative efforts and required remediation associated with correcting yk computer processing deficiencies were generally completed before the start of the calendar year 
subsequent to the start of the year  only minor modifications were required  and there was no measurable adverse effect on the company s operations 
incremental spending on yk related issues was charged to expense as incurred and was not material relative to overall revenues or expenses 
the company s earnings from operations in fiscal before interest and taxes were a record million  increasing more than from the previous year 
operating margins  which have increased steadily in each of the past several years  increased again  to in fiscal  up from and in fiscal and  respectively 
although depreciation and amortization charges have both increased at a rate greater than the increase in tuition revenues  operating margins have increased because of higher new student enrollments  improved student retention  greater facility utilization  continued operating improvement and cost controls that were further enhanced by synergies and operating economies from the two acquisitions at the start of the year  particularly the acquisition of conviser duffy  whose operations were quickly integrated into becker cpa review 
interest expense increased by million from the prior year  as debt was incurred in july to fund the company s two acquisitions  which were both made for cash 
by year end  all borrowings had been fully repaid 
net income of million  or per share diluted  was a record for any year  increasing by more than from fiscal fiscal year ended june   vs

fiscal marked the ninth consecutive year at devry institutes in which cumulative total student enrollment for the three semesters during the year increased  up from the previous year 
enrollment increases at devry institutes reflect the opening of new institutes in fremont  california  and long island city  new york  in addition to enrollment increases in previously opened institutes 
at keller graduate school  cumulative total student enrollment for the five terms of fiscal grew by compared with fiscal  reflecting the opening of five new teaching centers during the year and enrollment growth at previously opened centers 
tuition revenues also increased because of tuition rate increases of approximately at devry institutes in march and somewhat lesser increases at keller graduate school and becker cpa review during the year 
other educational revenues  composed primarily of sales of books  supplies and the becker course on cd rom  increased by million  or  because of the increased number of students attending the company s educational programs  to whom these materials are sold 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased to million because increased demands on the company s cash for investment in new facilities and equipment and higher accounts receivable from increased student enrollment  reduced the average cash balances held during the year

depreciation expense increased by million  or  from fiscal as a result of record spending during the past several years on capital improvements and additions throughout the system 
also included in educational services costs this year is the final portion of the expense associated with resolution and reinstatement by the ontario ministry of education and training of full financial aid eligibility for students enrolled at the toronto area devry institute campuses 
tuition refund expense at devry institutes  although higher in absolute amount  decreased slightly as a percent of tuition revenue from fiscal this is believed to result from higher admission standards  increased academic support and student service quality initiatives that favorably affect student retention and contribute to increased operating margins 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from fiscal student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs  and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending primarily reflects marketing costs associated with generating higher student enrollments at devry institutes  keller graduate school and becker cpa for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term  which began in july  for which revenue is included in the subsequent year 
student recruiting costs are charged to expense in the year during which these funds are spent 
marketing costs were also incurred for the new devry institute in west hills  california  which opened in november administrative expenses have also increased from the prior year in part to support continuing efforts by the company related to what is commonly referred to as the yk problem 
in mid  the company initiated a project to determine the magnitude of its exposure from its own systems and from those of significant business partners 
through audit  testing and remediation  the company identified and evaluated the readiness of its information technology it and non it systems  which  if not yk compliant  could have a material effect on the company 
the review and testing of all internal it systems have been completed  and those systems have been made yk compliant through change or replacement 
an inventory of pc hardware and software has been completed  and a plan was developed and implemented to replace any non compliant hardware prior to the end of the calendar year 
software vendors were contacted and are being tracked for follow up as necessary 
an upgrade or replacement plan was developed and implemented for any non compliant software 
critical suppliers of non it goods and services have also been identified and contacted for their compliance status 
in addition  the company is developing a contingency plan  targeted for completion prior to year end  for critical functions at its headquarters and other operating locations 
although efforts related to yk issues were comprehensive in nature  incremental spending on these efforts has not been material in any period and is being charged to expense as incurred 
the company s earnings in fiscal from operations  before interest and taxes  were a record million  increasing more than from the previous year 
operating margins  which have increased steadily in each of the past several years  increased again to  up from and in fiscal and  respectively 
operating margins increased because of higher new student enrollments  improved student retention  enhanced facility utilization and continued operating improvements 
interest expense decreased by million from the prior year  as previously incurred debt was completely repaid during the year 
net income of million  or per share diluted  was a record for any year  increasing by more than from fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from student payments for tuition  fees and books 
these payments include cash from student and family educational loans  from other financial aid under various federal  state and provincial programs  and from student and family resources 
the pattern of cash receipts is somewhat cyclical 
the level of accounts receivable from which cash payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  fees and books at the beginning of each of devry institutes semesters  which begin in july  november and march 
collections of devry institutes receivables are heaviest at the start of each semester 
in the first two months of each semester  collections typically exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period  providing sufficient cash flow for the balance of the semester s operations 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the spring semester and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
keller graduate school and becker conviser cpa review also experience a similar cyclical pattern in their cash receipts and expenditures based upon their respective operating cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of the related reserves  were approximately million 
included in these receivables is an approximately million greater receivable this year than last  owed to the company under various federal student financial aid programs 
this receivable represents funds owed to devry for aid disbursements in the latter part of the spring term but not yet collected from the department of education or other funding source 
similar receivable levels have occurred in the past and can occur again 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds 
the company estimates that historically  approximately of devry institutes tuition  bookstore and fee revenues have been financed by government provided financial aid to its students 
these financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained at current levels 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
this cash becomes available for general use by the company only after student loans and grants have been credited to the accounts of students and the cash is transferred to an unrestricted operating cash account 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted banks accounts  in part  to provide funds for the disbursements completed in the latter part of the spring term and  in part  to provide funds in anticipation of financial aid disbursements which occur at the start of devry institutes summer term 
cash generated from operations in fiscal reached a record million  up million from last year 
higher earnings and the increased non cash sources of depreciation and amortization accounted for the increased cash flow  more than offsetting higher accounts receivable and other working capital account changes 
traditionally  the company has been able to help fund its expansion by operating with very little  or even negative  working capital whenever necessary 
the generation and use of cash during the year reflects the cyclical operating patterns discussed above 
during some periods just prior to the start of a semester  cash balances may be supplemented by temporary borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operations each year has been sufficient to meet all of the company s operating and capital investment needs while reducing debt on a regular basis 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million  down million from the record level set in fiscal in just the past three years  capital spending has exceeded million for expansion and facility improvements  replacement and upgrading of school laboratories  and for teaching and administrative equipment 
contributing to the fiscal spending was the completion of construction of the new devry institute in west hills  california  completion of the new technology center addition to the campus in chicago  illinois  and completion of the new devry institute in tinley park chicago  illinois 
in addition  expansion and renovation of the columbus  ohio  devry institute was started  continuing on into fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be comparable to the fiscal level 
new and expanded devry institute campuses  expansion of keller graduate school and becker conviser cpa review into new operating sites  and new laboratory and teaching equipment associated with changing technologies will continue to require substantial capital spending in the coming years 
cash generated from operations and existing cash resources have been sufficient to meet capital requirements in the past and  with the company s revolving line of credit  is anticipated to be sufficient to cover expansion plans in the future 
in may  the company and its banks renegotiated the revolving loan agreement  amending it again to extend its term to august  on july   the company borrowed million under its revolving loan agreement in conjunction with the purchase  for cash  of the operations of denver technical college and conviser duffy cpa review 
in november  the company and its banks again renegotiated the revolving loan agreement  removing certain restrictions on future acquisitions and waiving the untimely delivery of loan guarantees by newly formed subsidiaries 
at june   all borrowings under the revolving line had been fully repaid 
future borrowings and or repayments will be based on the company s cyclical cash flow cycle and amounts required for capital spending and possible future acquisitions 
in july   the company borrowed million to meet cyclical needs prior to the cash inflows associated with the start of devry institutes summer term 
this temporary borrowing was subsequently repaid in full 
the company s bank borrowing interest rate is a floating rate of prime or libor plus  at the company s option  and will remain at that level based on continued achievement of certain financial ratios 
interest rates are adjustable quarterly  based upon these financial ratios 
at the present time  the company does not have an interest rate swap or other form of protection against increases in the floating rate but does fix the interval of interest rate adjustment on its borrowings for periods of up to three months to eliminate some of the possible variability in rates 
the company periodically evaluates its need for interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and projected borrowing levels 
the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if needed  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future
