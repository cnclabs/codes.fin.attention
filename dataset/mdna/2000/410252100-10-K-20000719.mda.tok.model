minority interest recognized in the statement of operations represents the minority shareholders portion of the income or loss for less than wholly owned subsidiaries

this decrease in debt was achieved even though the company spent approximately million in connection with its share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of fiscal  nce purchased additional shares of tibeco 
as a result  nce owns a share in tibeco 
the inclusion of tibeco s results of operations in fiscal did not have a material effect on reported consolidated revenues or consolidated results of operations 
the following comments relate to the company s strategic repositioning program 
on june   the company s board of directors approved a comprehensive strategic repositioning program designed to focus the company on its core music distribution business 
the program had four major components 
exit the her video  book and software distribution and service operations  
reduce the number of customers serviced in the music distribution business within her to a select group of strategic partners who could best benefit from handleman s category management and systems investments  
sell sofsource  the company s software publishing subsidiary  and 
implement a common stock repurchase program 
the operational repositioning activities  including employee severance programs  were completed during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold its book distribution business to levy home entertainment at a pre tax loss of approximately million  and its sofsource subsidiary to the learning company at a pre tax gain of million 
her has exited the video and software distribution business activities  as well as ceased providing services to a number of music customers 
the decision was made to exit these activities  as well as to reduce the number of customers serviced in the music distribution business  because these businesses or customers either did not provide an appropriate and consistent rate of return or did not have the potential for sustainable growth and profitability 
the repositioning program resulted in a million charge to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal  representing asset adjustments and cost accruals directly related to the repositioning program  other than those costs actually incurred and charged to earnings in fiscal and certain costs that were incurred in the last three quarters of fiscal that were required to be expensed as incurred 
a summary of the components of the million pre tax repositioning and related charge recognized in fiscal is as follows in millions first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter fiscal adjustments of assets to net realizable value intangibles write off other repositioning related costs total adjustments of assets to net realizable value included adjustments to reflect the estimated recovery amount of assets disposed of during fiscal that were directly related to exited businesses or customers no longer serviced 
the components of the provision were  principally  inventory of million and property and equipment of million  as well as certain adjustments to the carrying value of receivables of million  payables of million and investments  including international investments  of million 
intangibles related to either businesses exited  or customers no longer serviced  were included in the intangibles write off 
other repositioning related costs recorded in the first quarter of fiscal were principally employee severance costs of million  advisory fees of million  debt restructuring costs of million and inventory handling costs of million 
other repositioning related costs recognized in subsequent quarters were primarily employee stay bonus costs and advisory fees  which were not accruable as part of the initial repositioning charge  and therefore  were expensed as incurred 
the amount of each element of the overall repositioning charge was determined based upon the actual cost of the asset and management estimates of recoverability 
in the case of receivables  the fact that certain accounts would be settled with customer product returns rather than cash  which resulted in a reversal of gross margin  was taken into consideration  as well as liquidation value of the inventory returned since ongoing relationships with certain vendors no longer existed and  therefore  return authorizations would be difficult to obtain 
in the case of property and equipment  which was principally display fixtures in customer stores  the charge represented the net book value of such abandoned display fixtures 
there were no adjustments necessary to the original estimated repositioning provision of million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal the repositioning program resulted in a reduction of approximately  positions approximately of the company s total workforce 
this reduction occurred predominantly in the her division 
for the most part the reductions were in the following areas field sales representatives  distribution facility employees  and the corporate headquarters 
employee severance amounts were determined based upon an employee s length of service  salary grade level and compensation 
total employee severance paid in fiscal and fiscal in connection with the repositioning program was approximately 
and million  respectively 
as a result of the repositioning actions  the company expected to realize an improvement in operating income in excess of million pre tax 
the savings were to result from a reduction in operating costs at a rate greater than the projected decrease in revenues  because both average customer size and average sales volume of departments serviced increased significantly 
benefits of the repositioning program began to occur in the second quarter of fiscal as the program was implemented 
also on june   the board of directors approved an month common stock repurchase program  subject to the generation of cash from the sale of assets and reduced working capital needs  as well as the requirements of the company s credit agreements 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million under the repurchase program 
these repurchases are in addition to the  shares repurchased in fiscal under a repurchase program which was replaced by this new authorization 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at april  was million  compared to million at may  the working capital ratio was to at april   compared to to at may  property and equipment consist primarily of display fixtures  warehouse equipment and facilities 
the company also acquires or licenses video and music products which it markets 
purchases of these assets are expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations 
the company has an unsecured  five year   credit agreement  as amended  with a consortium of banks that expires in september no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of april  the company also has  outstanding as of april  under a senior note agreement with a group of insurance companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the senior notes  including scheduled maturities 
tibeco has an  uncommitted credit facility with a certain bank 
the company has guaranteed repayment of amounts borrowed under this facility and is required to maintain availability under its  line of credit 
as of april    was outstanding under this facility 
net cash provided from operating activities included in the consolidated statement of cash flows increased to  for the fiscal year ended april  from  for fiscal  primarily due to increased net income for the year 
net cash used by investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  for the fiscal year ended may  this change was mainly attributable to an increase in license advances and acquired rights of million in fiscal and the proceeds of million from sale of subsidiary in fiscal net cash used by financing activities decreased to  for the fiscal year ended april  from  for the fiscal year ended may  this decrease was principally due to lower net payments of debt during the year 
in connection with the repositioning program discussed previously  the company amended its bank credit agreement and senior note agreement to effect compliance with existing restrictions and covenants of the agreements 
management believes that the amended credit agreement  and the amended senior note agreement  will provide sufficient amounts to fund day to day operations and higher peak seasonal demands 
for further information  reference should be made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other information the company s financial statements have reported amounts based on historical costs which represent dollars of varying purchasing power and do not measure the effects of inflation 
if the financial statements had been restated for inflation  net income would have been lower because depreciation expense would have to be increased to reflect the most current costs 
inflation within the economies in which the company does business has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of the company s year efforts and the timely completion of all related projects  the company has not experienced any disruption in its business operations 
in addition  the company was not adversely affected by any of its key business vendors  customers or other partners not being year ready
