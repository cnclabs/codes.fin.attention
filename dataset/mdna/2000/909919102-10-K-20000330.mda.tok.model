item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations selected united and pro forma combined financial data of heritage and old united general 
certain statements in this report  including the following section  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which involve risks and uncertainties 
united s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forwarding looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition and weather conditions in the geographic and business areas in which united conducts its operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulations 
united is the result of the combination on february  of two savings and loan holding companies operating in montana heritage and old united 
although united was the surviving corporation  the merger was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposed because the stockholders and management of heritage controlled the operation of united after the heritage merger 
using purchase accounting  the historical financial statements of united included in this report for periods preceding the heritage merger reflect only the operations of heritage  while the historical financial statements for periods after the heritage merger reflect combined operations 
the following unaudited pro forma combined financial information gives effect to the heritage merger based on the purchase accounting adjustments  estimates and other assumptions described in the accompanying notes 
the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet and statements of income as of and for the year ending december  are based upon the audited annual consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of heritage and old united 
the unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of heritage and old united as if the heritage merger had become effective as of december  the actual audited consolidated balance sheets of united as of december  and  the actual consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   and the unaudited pro forma combined statement of income for the year ended december  which combines united s results of operations for the year ended december  and the operations of old united for the period from january  to january   are also presented for comparative purposes 
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income combines the historical consolidated statements of income of heritage and old united as if the heritage merger had become effective as of the beginning of the period presented 
the selected pro forma consolidated financial data is unaudited and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the heritage merger occurred on such dates or of the results of operations that may be achieved in the future 
while the operations of united on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  reflect the counterbalancing of operations of two different financial institutions and their differing operating policies  the pro forma and historical operations of united for the year ended december  reflect a unified operating policy that more closely paralleled the historical policy of heritage 
during  united focused its attention on expanding commercial  residential real estate  agricultural borrowings and some assets that were formerly maintained by united bank in investment securities to invest in additional loans

certain amounts in the historical financial statements of old united have been reclassified in the pro forma combined financial information to conform to heritage s historical financial statements 
results of operations in the year  united intends to invest a significant portion of its earnings in several new branches and people as well as in its valley subsidiary 
as a result of the costs associated with opening branches in bozeman and missoula  and a valley bank of arizona branch being built in scottsdale  arizona  united does not expect its earnings per share to increase in heritage bank will have increased personnel and operating expenses associated with its new branches  which will impact earnings per share growth for however  management believes that growth potential in these markets is good 
the acquisition of valley continues united s strategy of growth and geographic diversification 
net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the most significant component of united s earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
this amount  when divided by average interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin and expressed as a percentage 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in interest rates  the volume and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities expressed as a percentage is referred to as the net interest rate spread

as illustrated in the preceding tables  the principal reason for the increase in net interest income from to  and to  was an increase in the volume of united s interest earning assets 
the decrease in interest income from a planned decrease in the volume of investment securities held in portfolio was more than offset by a large positive contribution from increased loan volumes  as funds from borrowings  deposits and repayments of investment securities were applied to increase the volume of higher yielding loan assets 
this increased volume of loans was largely responsible for the million increase in interest income due to volume from to and the million increase in interest income due to volume from to average interest rates earned on loans declined during these periods as market interest rates declined slightly 
rates earned on investment securities declined slightly from to and also from to rates paid on deposits remained relatively constant from to and from to  resulting in only minimal changes in interest expense as a result of changes in such rates 
an million increase in savings accounts from to and a million increase in short term borrowings  resulted in a million increase in interest expense due to volume from to further increases in borrowings from to  particularly in repurchase agreements and fhlb borrowings along with a million increase in time deposits  caused an increase of million in interest expense in as compared to the increased interest expense was more than offset by the increased interest income resulting from expansion of united s loan portfolio during both and united s net interest income increased 
million from million for to million for and increased 
million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  provision for loan loss 
united provided  for loan losses in united provided  for loan losses in as compared with  in the increase in the provision for loan losses for was in part because of the increased average balance in loans receivable and in part because of management s evaluation of overall economic conditions  both regionally and nationally 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which is considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio in accordance with gaap 
future additions to united s allowance for loan losses and any change in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing assets are dependent upon the performance and composition of united s loan portfolio  the economy  inflation  changes in real estate values and interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate reserve levels 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  united generates significant non interest income from a range of retail banking services  including mortgage banking activities and service charges for deposit services 
non interest income remained consistent in when compared to at million 
in contrast  non interest income increased million  or  to million for as compared to the principal reason for this fluctuation was the strength of the home lending market  and particularly the refinancing market during  as interest rates were relatively low and stable 
the active refinancing market during this period resulted in a substantial increase in loan origination fees and discounts on sale of mortgage loans 
united believes that future increases in interest rates are likely to result in a decreased refinancing market which would negatively affect united s fee income 
rates increased in the third quarter of  which resulted in a decrease in the volume of refinancing activity and therefore a decrease in loan origination fees during of 
million 
other non interest income  including servicing fees on mortgage loans  service charges and fhlb stock dividends  remained relatively constant from to loan servicing fees increased 
million in due to mortgage servicing rights recorded and also 
million from equity in income of valley 
united also recognized a small amount of gain on sale of investment securities in and  while no investment securities were sold in non interest expense 
non interest expense increased 
million  or  to million in  and increased million  or  to million in salary and employee benefit expense represented 
million of the increase and was the result of additional staffing of loan originators and rate increases for existing employees 
salary and employee benefit expense  which increased million to million in from million in  also accounted for most of the increase in this increase was due primarily to increased salary and commission expense associated with the refinancing activity and growth in the size of united s overall operations 
to a lesser extent  this increase was also due to one time merger related charges of  and increased data processing charges in the first quarter of income taxes 
income tax expense increased 
million to million for and increased 
million to million for from million for the principal reason for the increase in both periods was increased income  after adjustment for non deductible goodwill amortization and tax free interest on municipal bonds and loans 
financial condition general 
united s total assets increased million to million at december  from million at december   and increased million in from million at december  the principal reason for the increases in both periods was growth in united s loan portfolio  which increased million during and million during the aggregate balance of mortgage backed and investment securities declined in  but increased slightly in as united worked to apply some of these resources in higher yielding assets 
loans 
net loans receivable increased million during to million at december  nearly all loan categories continued to show steady growth  although not at the same pace as  due to increases in rates later in net loans increased million during to million at december  residential mortgage loans increased as united expanded its loan production offices and added residential lending staff 
although smaller in dollar amount  united s construction  agricultural and commercial real estate loans  and its non real estate commercial and agricultural loans  grew even more rapidly during substantial increases in commercial and agricultural loans  which are consistent with new loan policies adopted after the heritage merger  resulted from increased marketing through officer call programs  primarily through united s great falls office 
mortgage backed and investment securities 
united s mortgage backed and investment securities increased million to million during and decreased million to million during the year ended december  in  united s purchases were approximately million while sales  maturities and calls totaled million 
the net increase was also offset by an unrealized loss in market values of approximately million in declining balances of investment securities from calls and maturities  and from the sale of million of bonds and government mutual funds during  accounted for the majority of the decrease 
mortgage backed securities increased during  as a result of net purchases of million of mortgage backed securities 
other assets 
real estate owned decreased  during to  at december   as united sold one of its two remaining apartment complexes in glendive  montana for  for no gain or loss and recorded depreciation of  real estate owned decreased  during as the result of the sale of the remaining glendive apartment complex for  a gain of  and recorded depreciation of  united purchased  of additional fhlb stock during and purchased  of fhlb stock during  primarily as required to support the increased scope of its operations 
united received fhlb stock dividends of  in premises and equipment increased million during  as the result of the construction of the two new branches in missoula and bozeman as well as computer purchases and upgrades for yk compliance  and increased 
million during  primarily as a result of the purchase of additional computer equipment and remodeling of united s home office 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles decreased  during due to amortization 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles increased million during as a result of the acquisition of old united in the heritage merger  the purchase of two loan production offices  and the purchase premium paid on state bank deposits  offset by amortization of  and changes to old united s historical net assets of deposits and borrowings 
united experienced a net increase in deposits of million in and million in the increase in deposits during and resulted primarily from the application of competitive rates on all deposit offerings by united as well as the offering of a greater array of loan products to attract depositors 
borrowings increased million to million at december   from million at december   and increased million during from million at december  the additional borrowings in both years  comprised of a net increase of million and million in fhlb advances and million and million in securities sold under repurchase agreements in and respectively  were used to fund increases in united s loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets 
when a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  united s policy is to contact the borrower between the th and th day of delinquency to establish a repayment schedule 
if a loan is not current  or a realistic repayment schedule is not being followed by the th day of delinquency  united will generally proceed with legal action to foreclose the property after the loan has become contractually delinquent days 
loans contractually past due days are classified as nonperforming 
however  not all loans past due days automatically result in the non accrual of interest income 
if a days past due loan has adequate collateral  or is fha insured or va guaranteed  leading to the conclusion that loss of principal and interest would likely not be realized  then interest income will continue to be accrued

asset liability management 
united s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on united s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of united s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in recent years  united s interest earning assets have exceeded interest bearing liabilities 
however  when interest earning assets decrease as a result of non accrual loans and investments in non interest earning assets  net interest income and interest rate spread also decrease and any continued decrease in the level of interest earning assets would generally result in negative impact on earnings 
one of the primary objectives of united s management has been to restructure united s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
savings institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of savings institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render savings institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by united to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  united has maintained the policy of selling the majority of newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
united promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
united also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
when maturities of loans increase  united offsets the increased interest rate risk with matching funds and maturities with the fhlb borrowings 
the following tables provide information regarding the maturity of loans included in united s portfolio as of december  the amounts reflected in the following table give no effect to assumptions regarding loan prepayments or payoffs 
loans with variable rates of interest are classified as due when the loan principal balances are contractually due  not when the interest rate reprices

stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  down slightly from million  or of total assets  at december  at december   book value was per share 
the decrease in stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of million for  offset by the payment of million in dividends on united s common stock  the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for

million 
business segment results 
united manages its operations and prepares management reports with a primary focus on geographical areas 
operating segments information  including earnings performance on an operating cash basis  is presented in the following schedule 
united allocates centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated usage of those services 
the operating segment identified as other includes the parent company and eliminations of transactions between segments 
heritage bank includes united s thrift banking operations in twelve montana cities 
the bank experienced steady growth in with loans increasing million or over and deposits increasing million or 
operating cash earnings for increased 
million over net income increased to million from million in the increase was due to the continued growth in the loan portfolio and favorable interest rates during the first three quarters of net interest income increased to million in  non interest income increased to million  and non interest expense on an operating cash basis increased to million 
heritage bank s operating cash performance efficiency ratio was in as compared to in heritage bank had thirteen banking locations during  but closed one drive up location in great falls  montana in also  a loan production office in polson  montana was closed in january during  united formed state bank to acquire a portion of the business of a failed commercial bank in fort benton  montana 
state bank has one branch office in geraldine  montana 
the acquisition of state bank was accounted for as a purchase and results of operations prior to the acquisition date of august  are not included in the segment information 
therefore the year is not comparable to on the acquisition date  united  through state bank  acquired certain assets of approximately million and assumed certain liabilities of approximately million

year many previously installed computer systems and software were coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code fields 
these date code fields needed to be reformatted to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this problem could have resulted in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of business operations  including production of erroneous data  inability to process transactions  and other operational problems 
as a result  many companies computer systems and software needed to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with year requirements 
united undertook efforts  prior to december   to address year computer issues 
united formed a project team and contracted with a computer consulting firm  to evaluate the year impact on united s mission critical computer hardware and software and embedded technologies in its physical plant and automated equipment such as atms  proof machines  vaults and security systems 
united has replaced  modified or reprogrammed certain systems  requires that new purchased hardware and software be year compliant  and continues to test its systems 
to date united has not experienced any significant yk related computer disruptions 
united will continue to monitor the yk issue throughout the year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
since united s earnings depend on its level of interest rate spread  its primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk 
united has established a formal irr policy  and heritage bank has an asset liability management committee and an investment committee  which meet at least quarterly to review and report on management s efforts to minimize irr 
several asset liability management strategies have been employed by united to minimize its exposure to irr 
these include selling most newly originated long term fixed rate mortgages  promoting the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions  and investing in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
interest rate risk sensitivity of net portfolio value npv measurement seeks to establish a methodology to measure the potential for the reduction of earnings and stockholders equity resulting from both lower net interest income nii and lower npv caused by changes in market interest rates 
npv is the difference between heritage bank s depository portfolio value and its loans receivable portfolio value 
npv thus provides a leading indicator of future potential changes in both nii and stockholders equity 
because of its asset size less than million  heritage bank falls under an ots exemption that allows utilization of an asset liability computer simulation program prepared and distributed by the ots 
the ots thrift financial report includes schedule cmr that provides detailed information about the balances  interest rates  repricing  and maturity characteristics of heritage bank s financial instruments 
by utilizing heritage bank s schedule cmr data  the ots runs computer simulations net portfolio value model utilizing ots assumptions 
heritage bank  per ots requirements  has established maximum percentage changes for npv resulting from instantaneous changes in interest rates of to basis points 
a maximum change of for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rate has been established by united 
a basis point change is used by the ots as the current interest rate sensitivity measure by which thrifts are evaluated 
heritage bank periodically reviews and makes changes to established limits for npv changes due to mergers and other market factors 
the following table demonstrates heritage bank s december  npv and the present value of total assets  npv ratio and basis point change for three instantaneous increases and the three instantaneous decreases in interest rates interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value dollars in thousands instanta net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets neous change in rates amount change change total assets npv ratio change bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp   bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp the following table demonstrates heritage bank s december  npv and the present value of total assets  npv ratio and basis point change for four instantaneous increases and the four instantaneous decreases in interest rates interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value dollars in thousands instantane net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets ous change in rates amount change change total assets npv ratio change bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp   bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp the preceding tables for and would indicate a decrease in npv based on three instantaneous increases and three instantaneous decreases 
this would be consistent with increasing interest rates during total present value of total assets has increased based on asset growth in however  based on the three increases and decreases in rates  the value of total assets would also decrease based on increasing interest rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operation results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows and others 
sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that united might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
