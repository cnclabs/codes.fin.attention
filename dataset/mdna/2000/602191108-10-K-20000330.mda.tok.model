item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements which are affected by important factors including  but not limited to  actions of competitors  termination of contracts at the convenience of the united states government  customer funding variations in connection with multi year contracts and follow on options that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
the company s military rugged business segment provides specialized computers and related peripheral equipment to the united states and foreign military defense departments 
equipment in this segment takes two primary forms 
the first of these is fully militarized products  usually designed especially for a particular mission area with demanding environmental and quality requirements 
the second of these is rugged products  usually based on a commercial baseline product  but adapted by the company to meet environmental and quality specifications that exceed the requirements for commercial products 
this entire segment has been impacted in recent years by reduced government spending and defense appropriations 
the militarized product area has been especially subject to defense budget cuts 
the military continues to reduce funding for the development and limited production quantities of highly customized systems and products 
the long design cycle for these programs creates an intangible cost in the form of rapid technological obsolescence 
some military programs that would have sought militarized equipment some years ago have modified the requirements to reflect a need for rugged or commercial products 
this trend has tended to benefit sales of the company s rugged product line 
even in the rugged product area  however  defense cuts have taken a toll 
competition in this area has become keen in recent years  as many government contractors pursue fewer military programs 
through its commercial segment  the company develops  manufactures and markets commercial products primarily for transportation  telecommunications and in field maintenance markets 
its products are airborne printers  in flight cabin management and entertainment products  rugged public access internet terminals  mass storage devices  and derivatives of rugged hand held intel based computers originally developed for military applications

effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
year compliance as has been widely publicized  many computer and digital storage systems express dates using only the last two digits of the year and will thus require remediation or replacement to accommodate the year and beyond in order to avoid malfunction and resulting widespread business disruption 
the company has an ongoing year project that identifies the programs and infrastructure that could be affected by any year issues subsequent to december  and has implemented a plan to resolve those problems identified  on a timely basis 
the plan has required a considerable amount of internal resources devoted by the company to resolve the pertinent issues 
as of december   the ongoing resource cost of the year project has not had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently estimates the total cost of its year project has not exceeded  over the life of the project 
costs associated with employees working on the year project have been expensed as incurred 
hardware and software purchases related to this project have been capitalized where appropriate 
the company does not anticipate additional significant costs as a result of the year issue 
the year project includes all management information systems which support ongoing business functions  other systems with computer based controls such as telecommunications  building environmental and security management and all suppliers and customers with which the company maintains a material business relationship 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place that has resolved the year issues affecting it and that this program has progressed normally and has been completed on a timely basis 
despite management s beliefs and the company s progress made on the year issues as of december   it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved 
in the event certain third parties are not able to resolve their own year issues  there could be circumstances in which the company would be unable to receive customer orders  manufacture  test and ship products  invoice customers or collect payments from those customers 
as part of its year project  the company has solicited written assurances from its customers and suppliers that each will be prepared for the year issue 
the company will perform periodic audits and tests of third party systems throughout the life of the project for year compliance 
however  there can be no certainty of total compliance from any or all of the third parties the company deals with on a daily basis 
the company has not yet seen the need for any widespread contingency plans to be developed for the year issue  but this will be monitored continuously as the company gains more information about the compliance programs of its suppliers and customers 
additionally  some risks of the year issue are beyond the control of the company and its suppliers and customers 
the company does not believe it can develop a contingency plan that will totally shield the company from an economic ripple effect throughout the entire economy should others fail to resolve their own year problems 
the costs of the company s year project and the timeliness of the completion of the project are based on management s best estimates  and reflect assumptions regarding the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the compliance plans of third parties and other uncertainties 
however  due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issue and in particular the uncertainty of third party compliance programs  there can be no assurances given that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
as of february   the company has experienced no significant detrimental effects or system disruptions from the year issue but will continue to implement those procedures as it deems necessary to ensure continued integrity of its programs and infrastructure relative to the year issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company has a term loan and an industrial development authority bond issue that are exposed to changes in interest rates during the course of their maturity 
both debt instruments bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair market value 
the company manages its interest rate risk by a periodically retiring and issuing debt and b periodically fixing the interest rate on the london inter bank offered rate libor portion of its revolving credit loan for to days in order to minimize interest rate swings 
a increase in interest rates would affect the company s variable debt obligations and could potentially reduce future earnings by a maximum of approximately
