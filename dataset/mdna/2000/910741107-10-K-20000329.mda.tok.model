item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had several unencumbered properties we could use to secure additional mortgage loans and over million available under the credit line 
however  current covenants in our revolving credit agreement may preclude us from utilizing all of our borrowing capacity 
one of the credit agreement covenants limits total company debt to not more than of a formula based calculation of total asset value 
as of december   our total debt represented approximately of such value 
we have begun discussions with our lender concerning the modification of the loan terms to increase this limit to and cure the default 
we may add one or more unencumbered proerties to our lender s pool of collateral properties to facilitate the modification 
in the event the lender is unwilling to modify the agreement  the lender could accelerate the debt  which is scheduled to mature in august the lender has indicated the willingness to modify the covenant and accordingly  management believes the company will be able to successfully modify the credit agreement 
in the event the company is unsuccessful  management believes the credit agreement can be refinanced with other lenders  although at higher interest rates 
employees at december   we had no employees 
the investment manager had approximately employees who were utilized on an essentially full time basis for uirt business 
risk factors an investment in the company involves various investment risks 
prospective investors should carefully consider the following factors together with the information provided elsewhere in this annual report in evaluating an investment in the company 
high distribution payout ratio since the ipo  our annual distribution per common share has been 
this distribution amount represents approximately of our funds available for distribution in funds available for distribution fad is ffo reduced by capital expenditures required to maintain the properties roof and parking lot repairs and replacements  equipment replacements  major maintenance  etc 
and leasing costs broker commissions  tenant improvement costs  and other inducements  along with certain other adjustments 
we believe that fad per share in may be less than per share 
accordingly  in order to continue making annual distributions at a level of per share  we will be required to access funds through borrowing  issuance of equity instruments or the sale of assets 
should we be unable to access such funds  we may be unable to maintain our recent distribution level 
any such failure to make expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common shares 
conflicts of interest the fee of the investment manager is based on a percentage of funds from operations before deducting interest payments on outstanding indebtedness and the fee payable to the investment manager  and is not dependent upon the profitability of our properties 
determination of the fee was not the result of an arm s length negotiation 
limited geographic diversification of the portfolio our properties are located in four states  texas  florida  arizona and tennessee based on percentage of gla  all of which are in the sunbelt region 
the concentration of the portfolio in the sunbelt region creates the risk that  should this region experience an economic downturn  our operations may be adversely affected 
limitations on acquisition and change in control our amended and restated declaration of trust the charter and amended and restated bylaws the bylaws contain a number of provisions  and the board of trust managers has taken certain actions  that could impede a change of control 
the charter authorizes the board of trust managers to create new classes and series of shares 
the issuance of securities by the board of trust managers pursuant to this charter provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  even if a change of control were in the interest of some  or a majority of  shareholders 
ownership limit  anti takeover effect in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities 
to ensure that we will not fail to qualify as a reit under this test  our charter provides that no holder of capital shares  other than any person approved by the trust managers  may directly or indirectly own more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding capital shares 
there can be no assurance that there will not be five or fewer individuals who will own more than in value of the shares thereby causing us to fail to qualify as a reit 
the ownership limits may discourage a change of control and may also deter tender offers for common shares  which offers may be attractive to the shareholders or limit the opportunity for shareholders to receive a premium for their common shares that might otherwise exist if an investor attempted to assemble a block of common shares in excess of in number or value of the outstanding capital shares or otherwise to effect a change of control 
changes in investment and financing policies without shareholder approval our investment and financing policies  and our policies with respect to certain other activities  including growth  debt capitalization  distributions  reit status and investment and operating policies are determined by the board of trust managers 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of the board of trust managers without a vote of the shareholders 
at december   our debt was approximately of a formula based calculation of asset value 
although the use of leverage may increase our rate of return on investments and allow us to make more investments than we otherwise could  the use of leverage also presents an additional element of risk in the event that the cash flow from lease payments on our properties is insufficient to meet debt obligations  we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the property could be lost through foreclosure with a consequent loss of income and asset value of the company 
currently  of our properties are mortgaged to secure the repayment of indebtedness 
no limitation in organizational documents on the incurrence of debt our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of indebtedness which we may incur 
if our debt to capitalization ratio is increased we would become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our operating cash flow and our ability to make expected distributions to shareholders and could result in an increased risk of default on our obligations 
failure to continue to qualify as a reit would reduce shareholder returns we must continue to meet a number of highly technical and complex requirements to maintain our status as a reit under the code 
failure to continue to qualify as a reit would result in the taxation at corporate rates and loss of pass through tax treatment which would have a significant adverse effect on the return to shareholders 
failure to qualify as a reit under the code during a taxable year would generally render us ineligible to elect reit status again until the fifth subsequent taxable year 
we will not be required to make distributions to shareholders in the event that we fail to qualify as a reit under the code and there can be no assurance that we will continue to make distributions in such event 
transfers of the common shares are subject to certain restrictions to protect our reit status under the code 
in addition  we may be subject to state or local taxes 
no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit  the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the application of state or local taxes 
risks associated with development and construction we intend to selectively develop and construct neighborhood and community shopping centers on a limited basis up to approximately of gla with experienced joint venture partners 
risks associated with development and construction activities may include abandonment of development opportunities  goals of the joint venture partner may not be compatible with our goals  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  possibly making the property uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a newly renovated or completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  financing may not be available on favorable terms for development of a property  permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms to replace a short term construction loan  and construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations could result in the inability to develop a property or a delay in completion of the project 
any delay in completion would delay cash flow from such project needed to service debt  if any  on such project 
real estate investment risks economic performance and value of properties dependent on many factors real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service  our income and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will decrease 
the income from and market value of a leased property may be decreased by such factors as changes in the general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area  the attractiveness of the properties to tenants and competition from other available space 
real estate values and income are also affected by such factors as government regulations and changes in real estate  zoning or tax laws  interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws 
adverse economic conditions could decrease the ability of a tenant to make its lease payments  resulting in a reduction in our cash flow and a decrease in the value of the property leased to such tenant in the event the lease is terminated and we are unable to lease the property to another tenant on similar or better terms  or at all 
in addition  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
we not only could lose the cash flow from such defaulting tenant  but in order to prevent a foreclosure  also might divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet mortgage payments  if any  and pay other expenses associated with owning the property with respect to which the default occurred 
illiquidity of real estate investments equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to make changes in our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  mortgage payments and  to the extent a property is not subject to triple net leases  certain significant expenditures such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment  and should such events occur  our income and funds available for distribution would decrease 
changes in laws costs resulting from changes in real estate taxes generally may be passed through to tenants and  to such extent  will not affect our results of operations 
increases in income  service or transfer taxes  however  generally are not passed through to tenants under the leases and may decrease our operating cash flow and our ability to make distributions to shareholders 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures  which would decrease our operating cash flow and its distributions to shareholders 
competition all of our properties are located in areas which have shopping centers and other retail facilities 
generally  there are other community shopping centers within close proximity 
the amount of rentable retail space in an area could have a material adverse effect on the amount of rent we charge and on our ability to rent vacant space and or renew leases 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  reits and major retailers that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants for properties  many of which may have greater financial and other resources than the company and may have substantially more operating experience than us 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at our properties face increasing competition from internet retailing  outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  catalog companies  direct mail  and telemarketing 
this competition may affect the amount of percentage rent retailers pay to us and their desire to renew their leases at our properties 
increase in market interest rate may cause a common share price decrease one of the factors that may influence the price of our shares in public markets is the annual distribution rate on the common shares 
thus  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of common shares to demand a higher annual distribution rate  which could adversely affect the market price of the common shares 
in addition  an increase in the market rate of interest may increase interest expenses under our variable rate indebtedness 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of any required remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial and the owner s liability therefore as to any property is sometimes not limited under such laws  ordinances and regulations and could exceed the value of the property 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell the property or to borrow using real estate as collateral 
we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations  taken as a whole  after consideration of pollution liability insurance policies that we maintain 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances  and neither we nor the investment manager has been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or other claim in connection with any of our respective present or former properties 
uninsured loss and condemnation we carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as from wars or earthquakes which may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss occur  we could lose both our invested capital in and anticipated profits from the property  and we would continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness on the property  other than non recourse mortgage indebtedness 
as of december   such non recourse mortgage indebtedness represented of our total mortgage indebtedness 
tenant leases may permit the tenant to terminate its lease in the event of a substantial casualty or a taking by eminent domain of a substantial portion of a property 
should any such event occur  we generally will be compensated by insurance proceeds or a condemnation award 
there can be no assurance  however  that insurance proceeds  if available  or a condemnation award  if given  will equal the value of such property or our investment in such property

nareit defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities in which the reit holds an interest 
management believes funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of the ability of uirt to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
uirt computes funds from operations in accordance with the standards established by nareit  which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  funds from operations does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of uirt s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of uirt s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund uirt s cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
results have been restated downward by  based on a clarification by the national association of real estate investment trusts of the definition of funds from operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information in this annual report on form k 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
results of operations quarter ended december  versus quarter ended december  net income was  or per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of  down from  or per share  for the same quarter of the decrease in net income from to is due primarily to the increase in interest expense 
total revenues were  for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  for the fourth quarter of this increase relates almost totally to acquisitions 
interest expense increased by  from  in to  in this increase was due mainly to the increase in the average debt outstanding between periods  from  for to  for and the approximately basis point increase in the rate of interest we pay on our revolving line of credit 
the increase in debt outstanding is primarily a result of expenditures for acquisitions since december  and the repurchase of common shares 
the increases in depreciation and amortization  operating expenses  and property taxes were primarily the result of acquisitions 
twelve months ended december  versus twelve months ended december  net income was  or per share in  compared to net income in of  or per share 
net income for includes the effect of  in amortization of bridge financing costs and  of extraordinary charges  or an aggregate per weighted average share 
earnings in before such charges were  or per weighted average share 
even though revenue and earnings were higher in  earnings per share before non recurring and extraordinary charges was relatively flat from to  because there were  more weighted average shares outstanding in total revenues increased to  in  compared with  for the prior year 
this increase relates almost totally to properties acquired since december  these properties were acquired primarily by using the  in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common shares in march and april we also borrowed funds under our revolving line of credit and assumed existing mortgage loans on acquired properties 
recently  the cash returns from properties that have the investment characteristics we require have been in the to of cost range 
conditions in the debt and equity markets have resulted in interest rates and return on capital requirements that exceed the level we believe provides us the opportunity to earn an appropriate profit on newly acquired properties  and we do not intend to purchase properties in these circumstances 
accordingly  unless such conditions change  we believe rental revenues in will not increase substantially over the level 
moreover  as discussed elsewhere herein  we may dispose of one or more properties in the five properties currently identified as potential disposition candidates accounted for approximately  or  of the revenue 
the book value of these properties at december  is approximately  if we sell properties and then do not use sale proceeds to acquire new properties  our rental revenue in will decline 
we may repurchase uirt shares with some of the proceeds  if any  in order to mitigate the effect on per share earnings that would otherwise result from any such decline in rental revenue 
however  there is no assurance that we would be able to repurchase a sufficient number of uirt shares to mitigate the decline of rental revenue  and earnings per share may therefore decline as a result of any such sales of properties 
interest expense  before amortization of bridge financing costs  increased by  from  in to  in weighted average debt outstanding increased from  for to  for the increase in weighted average debt outstanding is primarily a result of expenditures for acquisitions and repurchases of our common shares 
of the total debt and capital lease obligations of  at december    bears interest at fixed rates  the weighted average of which is 
the remaining  of debt bears interest at basis points over libor contracts with one to six months durations 
at january   the libor rates were approximately basis points higher than those of one year earlier 
a basis point change in libor rates would have approximately a  effect on interest expense based on the amount of variable rate borrowings at december  we anticipate further increases in interest expense during for several reasons 
the increases in base rates during will have a full year s effect in  there has already been an additional rate increase since december   and other rate increases are not unlikely  and we have increased our borrowings since december   and may be required to make additional borrowings to meet our capital and common share distribution requirements 
the increases in depreciation and amortization  operating expenses and property taxes were primarily the result of acquisitions since december  primarily in order to manage properties acquired in  the investment manager had approximately employees more on december  than on the same date in  since december   the investment manager employed four additional personnel 
all of these employees are assigned full time to property operations  accounting  leasing  and asset management and their salaries  related benefit costs  and occupancy costs are reimbursed by uirt to the investment manager 
uirt believes that the level of staffing at december  is generally sufficient to operate currently owned properties and additional properties that may be acquired in the foreseeable future 
advisory fees increased by  from  in to  in advisory fees are calculated based on of the sum of ffo before advisory fees and interest expense  and accordingly increase or decrease generally with revenue levels 
from january  through june   the advisory fee was based on of the calculated base 
the effect on advisory fee expense of the investment manager s voluntary reduction was to decrease such expense by approximately  twelve months ended december  versus twelve months ended december  net income was  or per share in  compared to net income in of  or per share 
net income for includes the effect of  in amortization of bridge financing costs and  of extraordinary charges  or an aggregate per weighted average share 
earnings in before such charges were  or per weighted average share 
net income for includes the effect of a  charge for the issuance of stock to the investment manager 
the increase in earnings before non recurring and extraordinary charges is primarily a result of operating income generated by properties acquired since december  rental revenues increased to  in  compared with  for the same period of the prior year 
this increase relates almost totally to acquisitions since december  interest expense  before amortization of bridge financing costs  increased by  from  in to  in weighted average debt outstanding increased from  for to  for the increase in weighted average debt outstanding is primarily a result of expenditures for acquisitions  including the amounts borrowed and repaid under the bridge financing arrangement 
the increases in depreciation and amortization  operating expenses and property taxes were primarily the result of acquisitions since december  primarily in order to manage properties acquired in  the investment manager had approximately employees more on december  than on the same date in all of these employees are assigned full time to property operations accounting  leasing  and asset management and their salaries and related benefit costs are reimbursed by uirt to the investment manager 
liquidity and capital resources it is our intention that uirt continually have access to necessary capital 
as noted elsewhere herein  we anticipate that new capital will be required in order to adequately maintain our properties  fund development and redevelopment projects  and maintain our per share annual distribution 
although we believe present conditions in the equity markets may make issuance of equity securities unattractive for the foreseeable future  as previously noted  we believe our capital requirements and common share distributions can be funded through a combination of cash flows from operations  additional borrowings  and property sales 
cash flows provided by operations for the twelve months ended december   and were   and  respectively 
substantially all of the year to year difference is the result of operating income from properties acquired since december  and the effect of changes in the amounts of and interest rates on debt 
we executed a revolving line of credit agreement during the third quarter of the line of credit  which is collateralized by seven of our properties  provides for borrowings of up to  at approximately basis points over a london interbank offered rate 
at december   we had borrowed approximately  under the line of credit  and had issued letters of credit aggregating approximately  approximately  was available under the line of credit at december  however  current provisions of our revolving credit agreement  which we are seeking to have amended  may restrict us to relatively small increases in our total debt until and unless property sales provide significant cash proceeds 
such provisions limit our total borrowings to an amount that does not exceed of a formula based calculation of asset value 
our borrowings currently exceed this level  and pursuant to terms of the agreement  we are in default of the agreement unless our lender agrees to an amendment 
if we are not successful in having the revolving credit agreement amended  or if property sales do not provide significant cash proceeds  we may be required to access alternative sources of capital to reduce our debt levels  and to meet our capital and common share distribution requirements 
the properties acquired since december  comprise approximately  square feet of gla  and were acquired subject to approximately  in mortgage debt 
we have also borrowed approximately  under our revolving line of credit for the cash portion of certain properties purchase prices 
in addition  one of the properties was acquired by a limited partnership in which uirt is the sole general and a majority limited partner  the limited partnership issued limited partnership units to the sellers of the property in consideration of the sellers contributing the property to the partnership 
such limited partnership units were valued at approximately  and are convertible to  common shares 
pursuant to board approval  uirt repurchased  common shares during the third and fourth quarters of the prices paid were the market prices on the dates of purchase and averaged approximately per share 
the share repurchases were funded with approximately  in proceeds from our revolving line of credit 
in january  our board of trust managers authorized us to repurchase as many as  additional shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions  such authorization to expire on december  we believe that at recent prices  and absent higher yielding acquisition and development opportunities  the repurchase of common shares of uirt provides an attractive reinvestment opportunity 
if we have sufficient capital resources and proceeds from sales of property  after repaying debt and providing for our quarterly distributions to shareholders  we intend to continue buying uirt shares 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the as rather than the year  which could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the prior year financial statements disclosed that the company had assessed the potential impact of the issue and did not anticipate that the year issue would pose significant operations problems for the company 
to date  there have been no problems  interruptions or uncertainties resulting from the year issue as it relates to the company or its operations  and we do not anticipate any future problems or costs resulting from the year issue 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations to be an alternate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
we believe that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of uirt s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to  for the fourth quarter of  as compared to  for the same period of for the twelve months ended december   funds from operations totaled  up  from the same period of the prior year 
this increase relates almost totally to the impact of uirt s acquisitions since december  united investors realty trust calculation of funds from operations and funds available for distribution three months ended twelve months ended dec dec dec dec restated funds from operations net income     plus real estate related depreciation and amortization     plus loss on early extinguishment of debt    plus write off of unamortized bridge financing costs  plus minority interest in downreit partnerships     funds from operations     funds from operations per share and downreit unit funds available for distribution funds from operations     plus amortization of financing costs     less tenant improvements and leasing commissions     less non recoverable recurring capital improvements     less straight line rents  net of  bad debt write off in march     plus forgiveness of option loans   amounts received from seller pursuant to master lease   funds available for distribution     funds available for distribution per share and downreit unit basic and diluted weighted average number of shares and downreit partnership units     the twelve months ended december  results have been restated downward by  based on a clarification by the national association of real estate investment trusts of the definition of funds from operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of basis points in interest rates would have approximately a  effect on interest expense based on the amount of variable rate borrowings at december  all such variable rate borrowings have original maturities through we do not have any significant foreign operations and thus are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
