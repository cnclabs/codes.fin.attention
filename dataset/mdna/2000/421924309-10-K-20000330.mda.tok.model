item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of healthsouth  including various factors related to acquisitions we have made during the periods indicated  the timing and nature of which have significantly affected our consolidated results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we completed the following major acquisitions over the last three years common share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on march  o on march   we acquired health images  inc the health images acquisition 
a total of  shares of healthsouth common stock were issued in the transaction  representing a value of approximately  at the time of the acquisition 
at that time  health images operated freestanding diagnostic centers in states and six in the united kingdom 
o on september   we acquired asc network corporation the asc acquisition 
we paid approximately  in cash for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of asc and assumed approximately  in debt 
at that time  asc operated outpatient surgery centers in eight states 
o on october   we acquired national imaging affiliates  inc the nia acquisition 
a total of  shares of healthsouth common stock were issued in the transaction  representing a value of approximately  at the time of the acquisition 
at that time  nia operated eight diagnostic imaging centers in six states 
o on october   we acquired horizon cms healthcare corporation the horizon cms acquisition 
a total of  shares of healthsouth common stock were issued in the transaction  representing a value of approximately  at the time of the acquisition  and we assumed approximately  in debt 
at that time  horizon cms operated inpatient rehabilitation facilities and approximately outpatient rehabilitation centers  among other strategic businesses  as well as certain long term care businesses 
on december   we sold the long term care assets of horizon cms  including long term care facilities  specialty hospitals  institutional pharmacy locations and over  rehabilitation therapy contracts with long term care facilities  to integrated health services  inc ihs 
ihs paid approximately  in cash net of certain adjustments and assumed approximately  in debt in the transaction 
o on july   we acquired columbia hca healthcare corporation s interest in or entered into interim management arrangements with respect to outpatient surgery centers located in states the columbia hca acquisition 
the cash purchase price was approximately  o on july   we acquired national surgery centers  inc the nsc acquisition 
a total of  shares of healthsouth common stock were issued in connection with the transaction  representing a value of approximately  at that time  nsc operated outpatient surgery centers in states 
o on june   we acquired from mariner post acute network  inc mariner substantially all of the assets of mariner s american rehability services division the rehability acquisition  which operated approximately outpatient rehabilitation centers in states 
the net cash purchase price was approximately  each of the asc acquisition  the horizon cms acquisition  the nia acquisition  the columbia hca acquisition and the rehability acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquired operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
each of the health images acquisition and the nsc acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  with the exception of data set forth relating to revenues derived from medicare and medicaid  all amounts shown in the following discussion have been restated to reflect such acquisitions 
health images and nsc did not separately track such revenues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we determine the amortization period of the cost in excess of net asset value of purchased facilities based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual purchase transaction 
the evaluation includes an analysis of historic and projected financial performance  an evaluation of the estimated useful life of the buildings and fixed assets acquired  the indefinite useful life of certificates of need and licenses acquired  the competition within local markets  lease terms where applicable  and the legal terms of partnerships where applicable 
we utilize independent appraisers and rely on our own management expertise in evaluating each of the factors noted above 
with respect to the carrying value of the excess of cost over net asset value of individual purchased facilities and other intangible assets  we determine on a quarterly basis whether an impairment event has occurred by considering factors such as the market value of the asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action by regulators  a history of operating losses or cash flow losses  or a projection of continuing losses associated with an operating entity 
the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  our carrying value of the asset will be reduced by the estimated shortfall of cash flows to the estimated fair market value 
in  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires an enterprise to report operating segments based upon the way its operations are managed 
this approach defines operating segments along the lines used by management to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions 
based on our management and reporting structure  segment information has been presented for inpatient and other clinical services and outpatient services 
the inpatient and other clinical services segment includes the operations of our inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical centers  as well as the operations of certain physician practices and other clinical services which are managerially aligned with our inpatient services 
we have aggregated the financial results of our outpatient rehabilitation facilities  outpatient surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers into the outpatient services segment 
these three types of facilities have common economic characteristics  provide similar services  serve a similar class of customers  cross utilize administrative services and operate in a similar regulatory environment 
in addition  our integrated service model strategy combines these services in a seamless environment for the delivery of patient care on an episodic basis 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for financial data for each of our operating segments 
our revenues include net patient service revenues and other operating revenues 
net patient service revenues are reported at estimated net realizable amounts from patients  insurance companies  third party payors primarily medicare and medicaid and others for services rendered 
revenues from third party payors also include estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements which are subject to final review and settlement by appropriate authorities 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility  and contractual adjustments based on historical experience and the terms of payor contracts 
net accounts receivable include only those amounts we estimate to be collectible 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third party payors 
our reimbursement from governmental third party payors is based upon cost reports and other reimbursement mechanisms which require the application and interpretation of complex regulations and policies  and such reimbursement is subject to various levels of review and adjustment by fiscal intermediaries and others  which may affect the final determination of reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many payor sources to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and third party payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels 
in addition  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicare reimbursement for certain services 
we cannot now predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect such proposals would have on us 
changes in reimbursement policies or rates by private or governmental payors could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in many cases  we operate more than one site within a market 
in such markets  there is customarily an outpatient center or inpatient facility with associated satellite outpatient locations 
for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  same store operations are measured on locations within markets in which similar operations existed at the end of the period and include the operations of additional locations opened within the same market 
new store operations are measured on locations within new markets 
we may  from time to time  close or consolidate similar locations in multi site markets to obtain efficiencies and respond to changes in demand 
results of operations twelve month periods ended december  and our operations generated revenues of  in  an increase of  or  as compared to revenues 
same store revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  as compared to the same period in new store revenues for were  same store revenues reflect the first full year of operations of the horizon cms facilities and the asc facilities acquired in october new store revenues reflect primarily the addition of facilities from the columbia hca acquisition and our single facility acquisitions through internal development see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the addition of these operations and increases in patient volume 
revenues generated from patients under the medicare and medicaid programs respectively accounted for and of total revenues for  compared to and of total revenues for revenues from any other single third party payor were not significant in relation to our total revenues 
during  same store inpatient days  outpatient visits  surgical cases and diagnostic cases increased   and  respectively 
revenue per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case for same store operations decreased by   and  respectively 
operating expenses  at the operating unit level  were  or of revenues  for  compared to of revenues for included in operating expenses  at the operating unit level  for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  related to our plan to dispose of or otherwise discontinue substantially all of our home health operations  as described below 
excluding the non recurring expense  operating expenses  at the operating unit level  were  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in same store revenues noted above 
same store operating expenses for  excluding the non recurring expense item noted above  were  or of related revenues 
new store operating expenses were  or of related revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in as a percentage of revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses remained constant at in and total operating expenses were  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for included in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  related to our plan to dispose of or otherwise discontinue substantially all of our home health operations  as described below 
excluding the non recurring item  the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues for depreciation and amortization expense was  for  compared to  for the increase resulted from our investment in additional assets 
interest expense increased to  in  compared to  for  primarily because of the increased amount outstanding under our credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources 
for  interest income was  compared to  for the increase in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in the average amount outstanding in interest bearing investments 
merger expenses in of  represent costs incurred or accrued in connection with completing the nsc acquisition 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we adopted a plan to dispose of or otherwise discontinue substantially all of our home health operations 
the decision to adopt the plan was prompted in large part by the negative impact of the balanced budget act the bba  which placed reimbursement limits on home health businesses 
the limits were announced in march and we thereafter began to see the adverse affect on home health margins 
the negative trends that occurred as a result of the reduction in reimbursement brought about by the bba caused us to re evaluate our view of the home health product line 
the plan was approved by the board of directors on september  and all home health operations covered by the plan were closed by december  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately  related to the home health plan 
for a more detailed discussion of this charge  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we determined that approximately  in notes receivable and approximately  in accounts receivable would not be collectible as a result of the closing of our home health operations 
these non recurring amounts were recognized in operating unit expenses and the provision for doubtful accounts  respectively 
the total non recurring charges and expenses included in the results of operations for the year ended december  related to the home health plan was approximately  during the fourth quarter of  we adopted a plan to dispose of or otherwise substantially discontinue the operations of certain facilities that did not fit with our integrated service model strategy see item  business company strategy  underperforming facilities and facilities not located in target markets 
the board of directors approved the plan on december  and as of march   of the identified facilities had been closed 
the remaining are predominantly facilities in which the consent of unaffiliated partners is required prior to closing 
we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately  related to the fourth quarter restructuring plan 
for a more detailed discussion of this charge  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for  the facilities that were included in the third and fourth quarter restructuring charges described above recorded revenues of  a pre tax loss of  and negative cash flows from operations of approximately  we do not expect elimination of these revenues  costs and negative cash flows to have a material impact on future results of operations 
at december   we had a remaining liability for restructuring charges of approximately  the majority of this liability  approximately  represented lease abandonment costs 
the timing of these lease abandonment costs is reflected in the schedule of future minimum lease payments under all operating leases included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had incurred  of these lease abandonment costs through december  of the remaining  restructuring liability  we had paid out  through december  and the remainder is expected to be paid out ratably over the months ending december  in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to a rehabilitation hospital we had previously closed and recorded a  loss on the sale of our physical therapy staffing business 
total non recurring charges and expenses included in the results of operations for the year ended december  were approximately  for further discussion  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income before minority interests and income taxes for was  compared to  for minority interests reduced income before income taxes by  in  compared to  for the provision for income taxes for was  compared to  for excluding the tax effects of the impairment and restructuring charges  the merger costs  and the loss on sale of assets  the effective tax rate for was  compared to for see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net income for was  twelve month periods ended december  and our operations generated revenues of  in  an increase of  or  as compared to revenues 
same store revenues for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  as compared to the same period in  excluding discontinued home health operations 
new store revenues for were  the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the addition of new operations and increases in patient volume 
revenues generated from patients under the medicare and medicaid programs respectively accounted for and of total revenues for  compared to and of total revenues for revenues from any other single third party payor were not significant in relation to our total revenues 
during  same store inpatient days  outpatient visits  surgical cases and diagnostic cases increased   and  respectively 
revenue per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case for same store operations decreased by   and  respectively 
operating expenses  at the operating unit level  were  or of revenues  for  compared to of revenues for included in operating expenses  at the operating unit level  for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  which related primarily to our plan to write off obsolete equipment 
excluding the non recurring expense  operating expenses at the operating unit level were  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to the decline in same store revenues per inpatient day  outpatient visit  surgical case and diagnostic case 
same store operating expenses for  excluding the non recurring expense item noted above  were  or of related revenues 
new store operating expenses were  or of related revenues 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in included in corporate general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december   is a non recurring expense item of approximately  this expense item included write offs of investments and notes of  expenses related to year remediation of  and expenses related to the proposed spin off of our inpatient operations of  excluding the non recurring expense  as a percentage of revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses increased from in to in total operating expenses were  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for the provision for doubtful accounts was  or of revenues  for  compared to  or of revenues  for included in the provision for doubtful accounts is  in expense recognized in the third quarter of and  in expense recognized in the fourth quarter of the third quarter provision includes the charge off of accounts receivable of facilities included in the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in these accounts receivable were determined to be uncollectible by local and regional operations management personnel who assumed collection responsibilities in the third quarter of in connection with the restructuring of our outpatient regional business offices  which had previously been responsible for collection activities 
the fourth quarter charge reflects management s decision to adopt a more conservative approach in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the revision in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is due to management s assessment of the current healthcare payor environment 
this approach focuses more heavily upon the specific agings and payor classifications at each facility  as opposed to determining an estimate based primarily on historical write off rates 
depreciation and amortization expense was  for  compared to  for the increase resulted from our investment in additional assets 
interest expense increased to  in  compared to  for  primarily because of the increased amount outstanding under our credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources 
for  interest income was  compared to  for during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non recurring expense item of  related to the impairment of long term assets 
the charge was based on a facility by facility review of each facility s financial performance which determined if there were trends that would indicate that the facility s ability to recover its investment in long lived assets had been impaired 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total unusual and non recurring charges and expenses included in the results of operations for the year ended december  were approximately income before minority interests and income taxes for was  compared to  for minority interests reduced income before income taxes by  in  compared to  for the provision for income taxes for was  compared to  for excluding the tax effects of the impairment and restructuring charges in both periods and the merger costs and the loss on sale of assets in  the effective tax rate for was  compared to for see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
net income for was  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of  including cash and marketable securities of  working capital at december  was  including cash and marketable securities of  for  cash provided by operations was  compared to  for for  investing activities used  compared to using  for the change is primarily due to a decrease in facility acquisitions 
additions to property  plant and equipment and acquisitions accounted for  and  respectively  during those same investing activities accounted for  and  respectively  in financing activities used  and provided  during and  respectively 
the change is primarily due to reduced borrowings as a result of decreased acquisition activity 
net borrowing proceeds for and were  and  respectively 
net accounts receivable were  at december   compared to  at december  the number of days of average quarterly revenues in ending receivables was at december   compared to at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the concentration of net accounts receivable from patients  third party payors  insurance companies and others at december  and we have a  revolving credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america and other participating banks the credit agreement 
the credit agreement replaced a previous  revolving credit agreement  also with bank of america 
interest on the credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin  a base rate  or competitively bid rates from the participating banks 
we are required to pay a fee based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined credit ratings 
the principal amount is payable in full on june  we have provided a negative pledge on all assets under the credit agreement 
the effective interest rate on the average outstanding balance under the credit agreement was for the twelve months ended december   compared to the average prime rate of during the same period 
at december   we had drawn  under the credit agreement 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have a short term credit agreement with bank of america the short term credit agreement  providing for a  short term revolving credit facility 
the terms of the short term credit agreement are substantially consistent with those of the credit agreement 
interest on the short term credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin or a base rate 
we are required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined ratios 
the principal amount is payable in full on december   with an earlier repayment required in the event that we consummate any public offering or private placement of debt securities 
at december   we had not drawn down any amounts under the short term credit agreement 
on march   we issued  in convertible subordinated debentures due in a private placement 
an additional  principal amount of the convertible debentures was issued on march  to cover underwriters overallotments 
interest is payable on april and october the convertible debentures are convertible into healthsouth common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of a a subdivision  combination or reclassification of outstanding shares of our common stock  b the payment of a stock dividend or stock distribution on any shares of our capital stock  c the issuance of rights or warrants to all holders of our common stock entitling them to purchase shares of our common stock at less than the current market price  or d the payment of certain other distributions with respect to our common stock 
in addition  we may  from time to time  lower the conversion price for periods of not less than days  in our discretion 
we used net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
on june   we issued  in senior notes due and  in senior notes due collectively  the senior notes 
interest is payable on june and december the senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of healthsouth 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes to pay down indebtedness outstanding under our then existing credit facilities 
on february   we announced a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock over the next months through open market purchases  block trades or privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares 
in june  we announced that our board of directors had given preliminary approval to the exploration and development of a plan to divide our inpatient and outpatient businesses into separate public companies through the tax free spin off of our inpatient operations 
on september   we announced that our board had indefinitely tabled the spin off proposal due to a variety of factors  including the anticipated timeframe to complete the spin off  developments in the healthcare capital markets and favorable developments in the likely structure of the prospective payment system for inpatient rehabilitation services  among others 
we are not currently pursuing any activities with respect to the spin off proposal 
we intend to pursue the acquisition or development of additional healthcare operations  including outpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  ambulatory surgery centers  outpatient diagnostic centers and companies engaged in the provision of other complementary services  and to expand certain of our existing facilities 
while it is not possible to estimate precisely the amounts which will actually be expended in the foregoing areas  we anticipate that over the next twelve months  we will spend approximately  to  on maintenance and expansion of our existing facilities and approximately  to  on development activities and internet and e commerce initiatives  and on continued development of the integrated service model 
see item  business company strategy 
although we are continually considering and evaluating acquisitions and opportunities for future growth  we have not entered into any agreements with respect to material future acquisitions 
we believe that existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  and for the reasonably foreseeable future 
inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on our business  and is not expected to adversely affect us in the future unless it increases significantly 
exposures to market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the impact on earnings and value of market risk sensitive financial instruments principally marketable security investments and long term debt  as well as the interest rate swaps described below is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
we use sensitivity analysis models to evaluate these impacts 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
our investment in marketable securities was  at december   compared to  at december  the investment represents less than of total assets at december  and these securities are generally short term  highly liquid instruments and  accordingly  their fair value approximates cost 
earnings on investments in marketable securities are not significant to our results of operations  and therefore any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on future pre tax earnings 
as described below  a significant portion of our long term indebtedness is subject to variable rates of interest  generally equal to libor plus a predetermined percentage 
in october  we entered into three short term interest rate swap arrangements intended to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates resulting from the capital markets perception of risks associated with year issues 
each of these arrangements has a notional amount of  and matures six months from the date of the original transaction 
the notional amounts are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
in each of these arrangements  we pay the counterparty a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount  and the counterparty pays us a variable rate of interest equal to the day libor rate 
the variable rate paid to us by the counterparty is reset once during the term of the swap 
thus  these interest rate swaps have the effect of fixing the interest rates on an aggregate of  of our variable rate debt through their maturity dates 
the arrangements mature at various dates in april we would be exposed to credit losses if the counterparties did not perform their obligations under the swap arrangements  however  the counterparties are major commercial banks whom we believe to be creditworthy  and we expect them to fully satisfy their obligations 
at december   the weighted average interest rate we were obligated to pay under these interest rate swaps was  and the weighted average interest rate we received was 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  approximately  in long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest before giving effect to the interest rate swaps above  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
this compares to  in long term debt subject to variable rates of interest and  in long term debt subject to fixed rates of interest at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further description 
the fair value of our total long term debt  based on discounted cash flow analyses  approximates its carrying value at december  except for the convertible debentures  senior notes and senior notes 
the fair value of the convertible debentures at december  was approximately  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  the fair value of the senior notes due was approximately  at december  based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately  the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currency  are currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position 
computer technologies and year compliance in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems responded to the year date change 
we expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating our systems and invested approximately  in new hardware 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our internal systems or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
