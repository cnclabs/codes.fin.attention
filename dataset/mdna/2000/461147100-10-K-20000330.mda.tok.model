item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion relates to the results of operations and financial condition of intest corporation on a historical basis and  thus  does not reflect the performance of temptronic corporation or the merged entities on a pooled basis 
overview our revenues are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and  therefore  fluctuate generally in response to the cyclicality in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
during the past several years  the demand for ate by the semiconductor industry exhibited a high degree of cyclicality 
in  we experienced sequential quarterly declines in orders for and sales of our products 
we believe this was due to a reduced level of semiconductor manufacturing activity and corresponding cutbacks in semiconductor manufacturers capital budgets 
marked a turnaround in the semiconductor industry  which was evidenced by renewal in demand for ate and related equipment  which resulted in sequential quarterly increases in orders for and sales of our products 
 like  was another year of sequential quarterly declines in orders for and sales of our products  but to a more significant degree than in in  we believe worldwide demand for ics fell dramatically due to excess inventory of older ic designs  and slower transition to new ic designs resulting from softening demand for end user products 
in addition  the economic downturns in many world economies  especially those in southeast asia and japan  exacerbated the semiconductor industry downturn 
the combination of these conditions contributed to a reduced demand for products manufactured by semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn significantly reduced their need for new or additional ate equipment 
 like  marked a turnaround in the semiconductor industry and we experienced significant increases in the level of orders for our products bookings 
bookings were million for compared with million for as a result of the increased booking activity  our backlog increased from million at december  to million at december  during  we experienced significant quarterly increases in our net revenues  which grew from million for the quarter ended march  to a record million for the quarter ended december  we believe the increases in our bookings  net revenues and backlog reflect the increased demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers resulting from increased worldwide demand for ics combined with back end ate capacity constraints caused by the significantly reduced capital spending during while bookings and backlog are calculated on the basis of firm orders  no assurance can be given that customers will purchase the equipment subject to such orders 
as a result  our bookings for any period and backlog at any particular date are not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
certain portions of our business are less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of semiconductor manufacturers and so are less subject to fluctuation 
for example  some of our tester interface products are consumable  and sales depend upon operating expenditures of our semiconductor manufacturer customers 
also  semiconductor manufacturers may purchase our products for the purpose of upgrading  or to improve the utilization  performance and efficiency of  existing ate 
such upgrades tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
results of operations compared to net revenues 
net revenues were a record million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the significant increase in net revenues over the comparable prior period is the result of the aforementioned turnaround in the demand for ate in compared to net revenues for excluding the net revenues of intest sunnyvale formerly  testdesign corporation which was acquired on august  increased million or over gross margin 
gross margin decreased to for from in the reduction in gross margin was primarily the result of the additional fixed costs of manufacturing of intest sunnyvale as well as the higher component material costs of the intest sunnyvale products as compared with our traditional products 
in addition  the fixed costs of our new domestic fabrication operation and our manufacturing operations in singapore  both of which commenced late in the third quarter of  had a negative impact on the gross margin as these operations were not fully functional until late in the fourth quarter of selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the increase was attributable to several factors including the salary expense of new sales and marketing staff  increased expenditures for travel  increased commission expenses for external sales representatives resulting from the higher sales levels  increased advertising costs and higher levels of freight expenses 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the increase was attributable  in large part  to the additional salary expense of intest sunnyvale engineering and technical staff coupled with an increase in the number of engineering and technical staff 
to a lesser extent  increased costs of materials used in product development and travel expenses to facilitate collaboration among our several offices contributed to the overall increase in this expense category 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in administrative salary expense due to both staffing additions including the staff of intest sunnyvale and salary and incentive compensation increases for existing staff  legal costs related to both our patent infringement suit and to maintain existing patents and file for new patents worldwide and the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of intest sunnyvale 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of million 
our effective tax rate was for compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of goodwill amortization related to the acquisition of intest sunnyvale  which is not deductible for tax purposes  and a higher effective tax rate in japan  caused by certain recurring expenses which are not deductible for tax purposes which was compounded by the reduced profitability of our japanese operations in compared to compared to net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the decline in net revenues from the prior year is the result of the aforementioned severe downturn that the ate industry experienced during offset  in part  by the net revenues of intest sunnyvale from its acquisition in august through year end 
gross margin 
gross margin declined to for from in the reduction in gross margin was primarily the result of the additional fixed costs of manufacturing of intest sunnyvale which were impacted unfavorably by the significantly reduced revenue levels during the year 
in addition  material costs as a percentage of sales increased over the comparable prior period due to an increase in the level of sales of certain products with a greater component material cost in compared to selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was attributable to several factors including the additional salary and commission expenses of intest sunnyvale and increased travel expenses incurred in connection with intest s sales activities  higher levels of warranty expenses and increased advertising expenditures 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the additional salary expense of intest sunnyvale coupled with a growth in the number of engineering and technical staff offset in part by reductions in spending on product development materials and travel expenses in as compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the additional salary and other administrative costs of intest sunnyvale 
also contributing to the increase in were the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition  additional administrative staff  increases in professional fees  and the increase in amortization of certain prepaid expenses 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to million for from million in  a decrease of  or 
our effective tax rate was for compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the accrual of federal income tax on our earnings due to the change of tax status from an s corporation to a c corporation in june  offset in part by the implementation of tax favorable corporate structures and a lower percentage of earnings attributable to intest s japanese subsidiary in as compared to liquidity and capital resources net cash provided from operations for was million 
accounts receivable increased million from million at december  to million at december  due to the significant increase in sales activity during inventories increased million also as a result of the increased sales activity as we made purchases for future product shipments 
refundable domestic and foreign income taxes decreased  due to a refund of excess federal taxes paid during other current assets increased  primarily as a result of increases in prepaid expenses 
accounts payable increased million due to the higher production levels during accrued expenses increased  primarily as a result of the increased sales activity and staffing additions and their related expense accruals 
domestic and foreign income taxes payable increased million as a result of the accrual of income taxes on earnings during purchases of machinery and equipment were million for  which consisted primarily of improvements to our facilities in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the uk and singapore 
during the third quarter of we increased our domestic fabrication capacity through the addition of a machining operation in cherry hill and acquired machinery for this operation at a cost of approximately  during  we acquired additional production equipment and computer equipment for our domestic operations at a cost of approximately  and made leasehold improvements to existing facilities and furnished these improvements at a cost of approximately  we completed a renovation of our uk manufacturing facility during the third quarter of and spent approximately  on leasehold improvements and  on a new coordinate measuring machine for this facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent approximately  on leasehold improvements for a new facility for our intest sunnyvale operation  which relocated during the first quarter of we estimate that we will spend a total of  to complete this new facility 
we commenced manufacturing operations at our singapore facility late in the third quarter of and invested approximately  for new manufacturing equipment related to this operation 
on march   we completed our merger with temptronic corporation 
we estimate the costs incurred by both intest and temptronic in connection with the merger to be approximately million  including fees paid to investment bankers  professional fees  printing  escrow and other miscellaneous costs 
we will expense these costs at the end of the first quarter of we are beginning to assess ways to cross train our personnel and promote collaborative product development 
such efforts may temporarily increase operating costs or distract us from customary day to day business 
at december   we had million of existing cash and cash equivalents and a million unused line of credit 
we believe that these sources of liquidity plus the anticipated net cash provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including those of temptronic  for the foreseeable future 
however  future acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
year we rely on our telephone and computer systems  software and other systems in operating and monitoring all aspects of our business 
we also rely heavily on the systems of our suppliers 
both intest s and temptronic s efforts to be prepared for the year appear to have been successful  but if problems were to develop with our systems or with those of our suppliers and other vendors  we might be unable to engage in normal business activities for a period of time or times after january  any such disruption could cause our business to suffer 
international operations net revenues generated by intest s foreign subsidiaries were of consolidated net revenues in  in and in export sales from our us manufacturing facilities totaled million  or of consolidated net revenues in  million  or in and million or in we anticipate that net revenues generated by our foreign subsidiaries or from export sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net revenues in the foreseeable future 
the net revenues generated by our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  an outbreak of hostilities  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented by the united states or any other country upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future 
any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net revenues denominated in foreign currencies were in  in and in although we seek to operate our business such that a significant portion of our product costs are denominated in the same currency that the associated sales are made in  there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future due to our exposure to foreign operations 
net revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars expose us to currency fluctuations  which can adversely affect results of operations 
the portion of our consolidated net revenues that were derived from sales to the asia pacific region were in  in and in countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have experienced economic instability resulting in weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
although the past economic instability in the asia pacific region has not had a material adverse effect on our order backlog  balance sheet  or results of operations to date  there can be no assurance that continued economic instability will not in the future have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our consolidated results of operations

in addition to the factors described in this report  our actual consolidated quarterly or annual operating results have been affected in the past  or could be affected in the future  by additional factors  including  without limitation changes in business conditions and the economy  generally  our ability to obtain patent protection  and enforce our patent rights  for existing and developing proprietary technologies  our ability to integrate businesses  technologies or products which we may acquire  successfully  the effect of the loss of  or reduction in orders from  a major customer  and competition from other manufacturers of docking hardware  test head manipulators  tester interfaces and related ate interface products 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of its business 
the company employs risk management strategies including the use of forward exchange rate contracts to manage this exposure 
the company s objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily in the japanese yen 
the company s japanese operations expose its earnings to changes in currency exchange rates because its japanese subsidiary makes its sales in japanese yen and purchases its sales inventory in us dollars 
forward exchange rate contracts are used to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of the company s gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively impacted from significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
the company purchases forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts necessary to pay the us dollar denominated obligations of its japanese subsidiary 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is intest s policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting intest s exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
intest does not hedge all of its currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on its net income 
intest does not expect that its results of operations or liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities 
the notional amounts of intest s forward exchange rate contracts are used only to satisfy current payments to material vendors to be exchanged and are not a measure of intest s credit risk or its future cash requirements 
exchange risk related to forward exchange rate contracts is limited to movement in the exchange rates that would provide a more favorable exchange rate than that locked in the forward contract and forward contract amounts purchased in excess of the amount needed by intest to satisfy its obligations 
intest manages that rate risk by limiting the size of the forward contracts purchased to the known amount of obligations due and not purchasing forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
we believe that the risk of loss due to exchange rate fluctuations is remote and that any losses would not be material to its financial condition or results of operations
