item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company derives its revenue from several sources royalties  franchise fees  developer fees consisting of area developer and master licensee fees  company owned restaurant sales  turnkey development  brand contribution private label licensing fees  and other franchise related activities 
between and  developer fees grew to represent a significant portion of total revenue as the company sold development rights for most of the television markets in the united states and certain international territories 
franchise fees  turnkey development and brand contribution increased following this period as the rate at which stores opened increased 
since the company has sold developer rights for virtually all of the united states  developer fees derived from these non recurring transactions have declined as a percentage of total revenue  while typically brand contributions  franchise fees and royalties based on franchise store sales and revenue from the turnkey program have increased 
royalties are based on a percentage of franchisees net sales and are recognized by the company in the same period that the franchise store sales occur 
generally  royalties are earned at the rate of of sales for stores opened after and of sales for stores opened before that time 
royalties are paid by means of weekly automatic drafts by the company on franchisee bank accounts for royalty stores 
as of december   franchised stores were paying royalties on a monthly basis at the rate of 
this number of stores will decline as older franchise agreements expire the majority of which will expire after 
a portion of the royalties received by the company are paid to its area developers as royalty service costs for providing on going services to franchisees in their territories 
see business franchising area developers 
royalties have increased since due not only to the growth in the number of stores  but also to increases in average weekly sales 
the increase in average weekly sales is due primarily to the conversion of older franchise stores to the schlotzsky s registered trademark deli restaurant concept  as well as the selection of more free standing locations for newer stores  which have better visibility and generally experience higher sales than the smaller in line stores located in strip shopping centers which are characteristic of stores opened prior to franchise fees are payments received by the company from franchisees and are typically recognized into revenue as stores open 
the franchise fee for a franchisee s initial store is currently  the franchise fee for each additional store committed to and opened by a franchisee is  expenses associated with franchise fees are shown as franchise fee service costs and include the portion of the franchise fee paid to area developers 
the company generally pays area developers approximately one half of the franchise fees collected from franchisees in their development areas 
as the company reacquires a limited number of territories and buys down the percentage of participation by certain area developers  the company expects that franchise fee service costs will decrease as a percentage of franchise fees to less than 
restaurant sales are reported from company owned stores  and declined between and as a result of the company s strategy adopted in to develop only franchised stores 
the number of company owned stores declined from to two stores between and restaurant sales increased significantly in because the company s flagship restaurant in austin  texas was in operation the entire year and because two additional stores were acquired from franchisees during as of december   thirteen company stores were being operated primarily for product development  concept refinement  brand leadership and training franchisees 
management does not believe that the operating costs for company owned stores are necessarily indicative of costs for franchised stores on a system wide basis 
restaurant sales should increase as the company continues to acquire or open a limited number of additional company owned stores 
see business strategy company owned stores 
the company charges developers a nonrefundable fee for the exclusive rights to develop a defined territory for a specified term 
typically  a portion of the developer fee is paid in cash and the balance is paid with a promissory note 
see business franchising area developers and international master licensees 
prior to  when the company had fulfilled substantially all of its contractual responsibilities and obligations  such as training  providing manuals  and  in the case of master licensees  reasonable efforts to obtain trademark registration  it recognized as revenue the cash portion of the fee and the value of the promissory note  as determined by an independent third party valuation 
as a result of recent positions taken by the securities and exchange commission  the company made a change in its accounting policy for revenue recognition of developer fees effective january  with the change in accounting principle  revenue generated from developer transactions will be recognized over the term of the development schedule within the developer contracts generally about a ten year period 
developer fees recognized in and under the previous accounting policy were less than in previous years as most of the remaining domestic territories had been sold and fees from the licensing of international territories  which are not aggressively marketed by management  were sporadic 
fees recognized in primarily represent amortization of prior years fees pursuant to the change in accounting principle 
revenue is also generated from brand contribution private label licensing fees and the turnkey program 
the company has licensed manufacturers to produce schlotzsky s private label products and began receiving licensing fees from sales of private label foods to franchisees in late this revenue has increased significantly to  for   for and  for the company believes that private label licensing fees will increase as a greater portion of the systems menu ingredients are covered by the program  system wide sales grow  terms with various suppliers are renegotiated and alternative channels of distribution are exploited 
see business purchasing  private labeling and risk factors importance of licensing fees 
the company instituted the turnkey program to further assist franchisees in obtaining superior sites and to achieve more rapid penetration in those selected major markets where the company believes there is strong demand by franchisees for good locations 
under the turnkey program  the company works independently or with an area developer to identify superior store sites within a territory 
the company will typically perform various consulting services including  but not limited to  site selection  feasibility analysis  environmental studies  site work  permitting and construction management  receiving a fee and recognizing revenue upon the completion of these services 
the company may assign its earnest money contract on a site to a franchisee  or a third party investor  who then assumes responsibility for developing the store 
the company may also purchase or lease a selected site  design and construct a schlotzsky s registered trademark deli restaurant on the site and sell  lease or sublease the completed store to a franchisee 
where the company does not sell the property to a franchisee  the company sells the improved property  or  in the case of a leased property  assigns the lease and any sublease  to an investor 
the company anticipates that the total investment in each developed free standing location will be approximately  to  less for leased locations 
from inception of the turnkey program through  the company typically provided a credit enhancement in the form of a limited guaranty on the franchisee s lease for leased locations 
upon sale of the leased site or assignment of its earnest money contract  the company has deferred revenue generated even though proceeds were received in cash and allocable costs incurred in connection with the property 
when a lease guaranty is terminated  or the company s exposure to loss under the guaranty has passed  the company recognizes the revenue and allocable costs related to the site 
generally  if no credit enhancement is provided in connection with such transactions  the company may recognize the revenue and allocable expenses in the periods in which the transactions occur 
during  the company began emphasizing ownership of the real estate by franchisees through a program which entails acquiring the rights to a superior site and reselling the property  or its rights with any improvements  to a franchisee whose mortgage loan is financed by a third party financial institution 
the company provides credit enhancement for the franchisee in the form of a limited guaranty in favor of the lender 
generally  in those cases  the company recognizes the revenue and allocable expenses in the period in which the transaction occurs 
in some cases  the company may interim finance land and building costs in anticipation of permanent financing by a financial institution 
the company believes that the turnkey program enhances the company s ability to recruit qualified franchisees by securing and developing high profile sites and achieving critical mass for advertising purposes more quickly in selected markets 
in addition  the company charges a fee when it is requested to manage construction of a store on property owned by a franchisee or an investor 
this construction management fee is recognized when the store is completed

results of operations fiscal year compared to revenue 
total revenue increased from  to  royalties increased from  to  this increase was due to the full year impact of stores opened in and the addition of restaurants opened during the period from january  to december  also contributing to the increase was the growing influence of larger freestanding stores with higher visibility  a increase in average weekly sales and a increase in same store sales 
in addition  this increase is directly related to the increase in system sales 
royalties increased at a lower rate during than  primarily due to closings which occurred during however  the majority of closings tended to be underperforming stores and stores that had been temporarily closed and the franchisee had not made any significant effort to reopen or relocate within the time required by the franchise agreement 
in addition  the company s first national  network television advertising campaign was completed in impacting sales for the system 
franchise fees decreased from  to  this decrease was a result of fewer openings during  as compared to the fewer number of openings is principally the result of the company s increasing emphasis on superior site selection for larger freestanding stores with higher visibility and on more highly qualified and better capitalized franchisees 
developer fees increased from  to  while the level of developer transactions increased  developer fees reported for the year are primarily attributable to recognition of deferred revenue from transactions which occurred prior years due to the change in accounting principle 
as a result of the change  developer fees are now being recognized over the term of the development schedules 
because of the change in the accounting principle  the company anticipates that revenue recognized from developer fees will be a more consistent amount from period to period during the next several years 
restaurant sales increased from  to  this increase was attributable to company owned stores added during and the addition of five stores to the company portfolio during in the future  it is contemplated that several more company owned stores will be developed  operated and maintained by the company in certain key markets  but that the total number of company units will remain at a small percentage of the franchise system 
private label licensing fees brand contributions increased from  to  the increase was the result of more favorable terms with certain major suppliers than terms in place in the prior year  as well as the increasing volume of system wide sales and greater franchisee participation in the company s purchasing programs 
in addition  sales of private label products through alternative channels of distribution was greater than it had been in previous years  but still constituted less than of the fees recognized in turnkey development revenue decreased from  to  in  the company placed less emphasis on generating a material margin on the transactions it completed  but rather focused on bringing the best value in terms of project cost to its franchisees  while recovering some portion of its overhead cost 
in addition  in   of the revenue was related to transactions completed in involving the company s lease guaranties  which were terminated in the revenue includes approximately  of rental revenue from sites completed and under lease 
the company anticipates that turnkey development may remain at this lower level in the future as a greater emphasis is placed on superior sites and controlling the cost to franchisees of each project 
other fees and revenues increased from  to  this change was primarily due to the increased level of supplier contributions to the company s annual convention held in june  and a one time gain on the sale of the company s limited partnership interest in an entity that owns a small shopping center in suburban austin  texas 
costs and expenses 
royalty service costs decreased from  to  and as a percentage of royalties declined from to 
this decrease reflects the impact of the reacquisition and reduction of certain area developers interests in royalties during area developers generally receive approximately or of the royalties from stores in their territories depending on whether their share of royalties is or 
the company expects royalty service costs as a percentage of royalty revenue to continue to decrease because the company recently assumed territory management responsibility for its largest area developer in conjunction with an option to buy its territories exercisable until 
under this option agreement  net service costs associated with this territory management are of royalties effective october  and escalate to by august   versus the current rate 
the company may buy down the rights and obligations of certain area developers and may re acquire the full development rights to a limited number of territories over the next few years 
restaurant cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and paper costs  increased from  to  but as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased from to 
restaurant labor costs increased from  to  but as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased from to 
restaurant operating expenses increased from  to  but  again  as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased from to for  as compared to these percentage decreases were primarily due to operational efficiencies experienced and cost controls implemented in the management of the company owned stores 
the decreases are also due to the increasing sales outpacing the increased costs associated with operating the units 
turnkey development costs increased from  to  and as a percentage of turnkey development revenue increased from to 
these increases are primarily the result of fewer revenue transactions in compared to in addition the company experienced approximately  in write offs of turnkey development costs associated with sites under contract which were removed from consideration during the period 
most of the sites written off either demonstrated higher than expected development costs or no longer met current  more stringent standards for turnkey development sites 
general and administrative expenses increased from  to  and as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively stable at 
the company previously announced its goal of maintaining year general and administrative expenses at about the level 
depreciation and amortization increased from  to  and as a percentage of revenue increased from to 
the dollar and percentage increases were principally due to amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in and  such as area developer territories and certain franchise rights  and depreciation related to the additional stores the company was operating during the year 
interest income increased from  to  this increase was a result of a greater level of funds outstanding in the form of turnkey mortgages and interim construction financing under the turnkey program and an increase in the notes receivable related to the sale of limited development rights 
the company plans to reduce the level of interim construction financing by referring franchisees to third party financing sources 
interest expense increased from  to  this increase was the result of a greater level of debt outstanding during the current period 
the company expects interest expense will trend slightly upward as a result of the debt financing used to fund the re acquisition of certain area developer rights 
income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects a combined federal and state effective tax rate of for  which is slightly lower than the effective combined tax rate for the comparable period in based on projections of taxable income  the company anticipates that its effective combined rate for federal and state taxes will remain fairly stable 
fiscal year compared to revenue 
total revenue increased from  to  royalties increased from  to  this increase was due to the full year impact of stores opened in and the addition of restaurants opened during the period from january  to december  also contributing to the increase was the growing influence of larger freestanding stores with higher visibility  a increase in average weekly sales and a increase in same store sales 
franchise fees decreased from  to  this decrease was a result of fewer openings during  as compared to the fewer number of openings is principally the result of the company s increasing emphasis on superior site selection for larger freestanding stores with higher visibility and on more highly qualified and better capitalized franchisees 
developer fees decreased from  to  this decrease was primarily the result of less emphasis on these transactional fees and the fact that the development rights to most domestic markets have been sold 
the change in accounting principle did not affect revenue recognition of developer fees 
restaurant sales increased from  to  this increase was attributable to a increase in sales volume at the company s flagship store and the relocation and reopening of two company owned stores during private label licensing fees brand contributions increased from  to  the increase was the result of more favorable terms with certain major suppliers than terms in place in the prior year  as well as the increasing volume of system wide sales and greater franchisee participation in the company s purchasing programs 
turnkey development revenue increased from  to  in contrast with when of turnkey program transactions involved the company s credit enhancement on franchisee leases  only five of the turnkey program transactions involved such lease guaranties in of the   was related to transactions completed during involving the company s lease guaranties  which were terminated during the remainder of the transactions in involved sales of rights to real estate to franchisees or investors who acquired with the objective of selling developed properties to franchisees 
revenue in also included approximately  of rental revenue from sites completed and under lease 
other fees and revenues increased from  to  this change was primarily due to the increased level of supplier contributions to the company s annual convention held in july costs and expenses 
royalty service costs increased from  to  this increase was a direct result of the increase in royalty revenue for  as compared to royalty service costs as a percentage of royalties grew from to 
this increase reflects the growing percentage of restaurants serviced by the area developer system and whose area developers received approximately of the royalties from the stores in their territories 
restaurant cost of sales  which consists of food  beverage and paper costs  increased from  to  and as a percentage of restaurant sales increased from to 
also  restaurant labor costs increased from  to  and as a percentage of restaurant sales increased from to for the same period in these percentage increases were primarily due to operational inefficiencies experienced in re opening two company owned stores 
restaurant operating expenses have increased from  to  but as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased from to for  as compared to this decrease is due to the increasing sales outpacing the increased costs associated with operating the new stores 
turnkey development costs increased from  to  and as a percentage of turnkey development revenue increased from to 
these increases are primarily the result of  of costs deferred in being recognized in  the addition of staff to the turnkey program in late and during and certain costs being recognized for sites no longer being pursued 
general and administrative expenses increased from  to  and as a percentage of total revenue remained relatively stable at 
depreciation and amortization increased from  to  and as a percentage of revenue increased from to 
this dollar increase was principally due to amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in and  and depreciation related to the additional stores the company was operating during the year 
other 
net interest income increased from  to  this increase was a result of funds being loaned for turnkey mortgages and interim construction financing under the turnkey development program 
income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects a combined federal and state effective tax rate of for  which is slightly higher than the effective combined tax rate for the comparable period in liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  for accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased  primarily because of development territory purchases that were accrued in and funded in the company used only a net  of cash primarily in continuing its construction and mortgage program for the turnkey program 
net cash of  was used in investing activities primarily consisting of the reacquisition of certain area developer rights and the royalty stream associated with them 
also  the company completed three company owned stores and used net cash of  to loan to the franchise system for national advertising 
at december   the company had approximately  of debt outstanding 
during  the company borrowed approximately  in connection with the re acquisition of certain domestic development rights and drew on its line of credit to fund turnkey development activities 
during  the company had borrowed  primarily in connection with the re acquisition of certain domestic development rights 
as of december   the company had drawn substantially all of the  available under the company s line of credit from a financial institution to finance turkey program capital requirements 
in december  the company announced it had obtained a new credit facility for up to  consisting of  to refinance i repurchases of certain area developers interests in royalties into a long term facility  and ii renewal of a revolving line of credit used to develop company restaurants and restaurants being developed through the turnkey program 
the remaining  supports a letter of credit benefiting the schlotzsky s national advertising association  inc in its purchase of national television advertising 
the credit facility imposes a number of covenants on the company  including limitations on additional borrowings  capital expenditures  contingent liabilities  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  working capital and net worth 
while the company is currently in compliance with these covenants  failure to do so would have material adverse consequences to the company 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from the lender s prime interest rate to and all mature by the end of the company guaranties certain real estate leases  equipment leases and other obligations of franchisees 
at december   these contingent liabilities totaled approximately  included in this amount is a construction loan for a limited partnership in which the company and its subsidiary  schlotzsky s real estate  inc  own a combined interest in capital and profits 
the loan  for which the company is liable for the full amount  had a balance of approximately  at december   bears interest at prime plus and matures january monthly payments are being made by the limited partnership 
the company plans to develop additional company owned stores in the next months in the austin market and certain selected other markets 
funds of approximately  are estimated to be required for the development of these company owned stores 
the company anticipates funding these developments through long term financing or available working capital 
the company continues to refine its turnkey program and expects that it will have to sites under contract or at various stages of development at any given time 
the company has used the net proceeds from its public offerings and the proceeds from sites sold and contracts assigned to finance the activity of the turnkey program to date 
even with a lower level of anticipated activity in the turnkey program  the capital required to finance the turnkey program will be significant 
the tables below provide a summary of turnkey program activity since its inception and a summary of the status of the turnkey program at december  for the year ended december  turnkey program revenue consists of the following sales to investors and franchisees    development and construction management fees   gross turnkey program revenue    turnkey program development costs    net revenue from turnkey program projects    rental income    interim construction interest    deferred revenue recognized  revenue deferred  total turnkey program revenue    the following table reflects system performance of the turnkey program for the years ended december  and number of units sites in process at beginning of year sites beginning development during the year sites removed from consideration during the period sites inventoried as company owned stores sites inventoried as real estate or restaurants held for sale sites sold revenue recognized sites sold revenue deferred other sites in process at end of year invested at december  sites under development or to be sold  predevelopment site prequalification  total  the company believes that cash flow from operations  together with the proceeds of the turnkey program  collections from notes receivable and borrowings under existing credit facilities described above will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
year compliance the year issue is a result of many computer programs being written using two digits  eg  to define a year 
date sensitive software may recognize the year as the year rather than the year this would result in errors and miscalculations or even system failure causing disruptions in business activities and transactions 
the company s computer software programs utilize four digits to define the applicable calendar year and therefore the company believes that it has no material internal risk concerning the year issue 
the company received responses from many of its major restaurant equipment suppliers indicating that they and the products they sell to the company s restaurant system also have no material internal risk from the year issue 
to date  none of the company s major suppliers have indicated that they have experienced or that they anticipate material internal risks 
the company is continuing an in depth inquiry concerning the readiness of its major suppliers and those of the restaurant system 
the company has assessed and  where practicable  attempted to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year compliant 
the company attempted to educate its franchise system during to prepare them to anticipate year issues which could affect them locally 
the company believes that its costs associated with monitoring readiness and mitigating risks concerning the year issue have not been material 
there can be no assurance that third parties will continue to be year compliant 
the impact on the company s operations  if any  from the inability of any of its suppliers and franchisees to year compliant is not reasonably estimable except that if there is a national or regional crisis in the financial  transportation or utility infrastructure  it would likely adversely affect most commercial enterprises  including the company 
quarterly comparisons since the adoption of the schlotzsky s registered trademark deli restaurant concept in  the company has experienced growth in royalties and franchise fees 
store openings typically mark the recognition of franchise fees and the beginning of the royalty stream to the company 
accordingly  a large number of store openings has a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue 
the timing of store openings can also affect the same store sales and other period to period comparisons 
there were store openings in  in  in and in at july   the initial franchise fee was increased from  to  and was further increased to  effective august  the net profitability from developer fees is substantially higher than that derived from royalties and franchise fees because of the relatively lower costs associated with developer fees 
effective january   the company changed its accounting policy related to revenue recognition of developer fees 
prior to  the company recognized developer fee revenue at the time the agreement was executed  its obligations substantially completed  and the fee paid 
this was typically in the period in which the transaction occurred 
however  based on a recent change of its position related to these types of fees by the securities and exchange commission  the company made a change in accounting principle whereby revenue generated from developer transactions will be recognized over the term of the development schedule specific to each contract 
the change in accounting principle will result in these fees being recognized over an average of an approximately ten years 
this change was made effective january  the quarterly results for reflect the application of this new accounting principle 
in addition  the first quarter of reflects the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of  net of tax for the impact of the change for developer transactions that occurred prior to it is anticipated that as a result of the change in accounting principle  and the growth of the royalty base  revenue from developer fees will be fairly stable in actual dollars for the next several years but will decline as a percentage of total revenue 
moreover  the company anticipates that other revenue will also continue to increase contributing to a further decline in revenue recognized from developer fees will decline as a percentage of total revenue  resulting in more normalized margins 
the company also believes restaurant sales and private label licensing fees brand contributions will continue to increase as a percentage of revenue 
in  the company recorded a significant fourth quarter adjustment related to activities within the turnkey program 
the adjustment included the deferral of approximately  representing the excess of proceeds received of approximately  over the related development costs of approximately  in connection with the transfer of title or assignment of earnest money contracts on turnkey program properties to various third party investors 
revenue is deferred only in those turnkey program transactions for which the company provides a credit enhancement to the third party investor in the form of a guaranty on the franchisee lease assigned at the same time that the sale or assignment of the property occurs 
the company also deferred certain costs of approximately  associated with the acquisition  development and  in some instances  construction of the turnkey program properties 
the applicable tax effect of the adjustments was approximately  during  only five of the turnkey program transactions involved the company s guaranty on franchisees leases with third party investors who acquired properties from the company 
accordingly  most of the revenue from turnkey program transactions during was recognized in the period in which the transactions occurred 
turnkey program revenue in was a result of transactions that involved the sale of the site or land contract to a franchisee 
revenue for also included approximately  of rental revenue 
management believes that the company experiences only moderate seasonality 
the company attempts to make store sales less seasonal by offering a variety of products which tend to sell better during various seasons

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates on loans from financial institutions could materially affect the company s earnings because the underlying obligations are either variable  or fixed for such a short period of time as to effectively become variable 
at december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the increased interest expense of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  the fair values of the company s bank loans are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates
