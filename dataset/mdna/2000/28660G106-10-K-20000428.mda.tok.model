credit facility 
the company s credit facility with fleet provides for borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million with a million sublimit for commercial letters of credit for general corporate purposes  including working capital needs and acquisitions  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the credit facility matures in may the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is limited to the sum of between to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory up to a maximum of million 
the company s existing collateral base is more than adequate to cover the collateral requirements of the credit facility and management believes  based on discussions with fleet  that  if necessary  the excess collateral could be used to increase the borrowing availability under the credit facility to fund acquisitions or for additional working capital requirements 
the credit facility restricts the company s ability to incur additional non trade debt with certain exceptions  including indebtedness not exceeding million for a fiscal year issued in connection with certain asset purchases  and to enter into certain acquisitions  mergers  investments and affiliated transactions  and prohibits the payment of dividends on the company s capital stock  certain payments on its subordinated debt and the sale of the company s interest in its subsidiaries

future liquidity and capital needs 
the company has historically financed  and expects to continue to finance  its internal growth and acquisitions primarily through internally generated funds  its credit facility and external financing 
the company s principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  debt service and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
as a result of several acquisitions during the past five years  the growth in direct distribution relationships for additional fragrance brands and certain favorable product buying opportunities  the company s working capital needs have increased significantly 
nevertheless  the company believes that internally generated funds and available financing under the credit facility will be sufficient to cover the company s working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months  other than any additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion of the company s operations through acquisitions of brands or new product distribution arrangements 
the company has discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding possible acquisitions by the company of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
the company currently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although it periodically executes routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that it will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of its operations 
the company s future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon its relative amounts of current assets principally cash  accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities principally short term debt  accrued expenses and accounts payable 
additional inventory requirements and accounts receivable can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity  particularly during expansion 
to date  the company generally has not experienced any material adverse problems with the collection of accounts receivable relating to its fragrance operations 
there can be no assurance that refusals to pay or delays in payment would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations and general financial condition in the future 
the company establishes reserves and provides allowances for returns at the time of sale based upon historical experience  but there can be no assurance that such reserves and allowances will be adequate 
the characteristics of the company s business do not generally require it to make significant ongoing capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily relating to computer software and hardware costs and the purchase of warehouse and manufacturing equipment 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it is materially at risk relating to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price risks fluctuations 
the only debt instrument of the company that is subject to interest rate fluctuations is its million credit facility 
while inflation likely would increase the interest rates that the company pays on its credit facility  based on the amounts and projected utilization of the credit facility  the company does not anticipate that any such increase would be material to its results of operations 
further  all of the company s purchases of fragrances and related cosmetic products from foreign suppliers are in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency exchange rate risks 
moreover  while the company s international sales may be subject to foreign currency fluctuation risks  such sales  and any currency fluctuations relating to those sales  have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that it experienced any material change in its market risk relating to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price risks fluctuations during the fiscal year ended january
