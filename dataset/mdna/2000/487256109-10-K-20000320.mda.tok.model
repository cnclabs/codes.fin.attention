overview general we sell cookies and crackers  custom baked products to other manufacturers of branded food products  pie crusts and ice cream cones 
our net sales are principally affected by product pricing and quality  brand recognition  new product introductions  product line extensions  marketing and service 
we manage these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring our higher margin products while driving volume through our national dsd distribution system 
the principal elements comprising our cost of sales are raw and packaging materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the major raw materials that we use in the manufacture of our products are flour  sugar  chocolate  shortening and milk 
we also use paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  as well as films and plastics to package our products 
the prices of these raw materials have been subject to significant volatility 
we have mitigated the effect of such volatility in the past through our hedging programs  but we may not be successful in protecting our business from price increases in the future 
in addition to the foregoing factors  our cost of sales is affected by the efficiency of production methods and manufacturing capacity utilization 
our selling  marketing and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of labor and lease costs associated with our national dsd distribution system  trade and consumer promotion costs  other advertising costs and the cost of our corporate offices 
while costs associated with our national dsd distribution system and the cost of our corporate offices are generally fixed  promotion and other advertising costs are more variable 
promotion and other advertising costs represent the largest component of our cost structure other than cost of sales and are principally influenced by changes in net sales 
matters affecting comparability keebler s fiscal year consists of thirteen four week periods fifty two or fifty three weeks and ends on the saturday nearest december the and fiscal years consisted of fifty two weeks and the fiscal year consisted of fifty three weeks 
keebler s operating results for the year ended january   include a million pre tax restructuring and impairment charge resulting from a decision to close our sayreville  new jersey  manufacturing facility due to excess capacity within the company s manufacturing network 
see additional disclosure regarding this charge under the caption restructuring and impairment charge in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
keebler s operating results for the year ended january   include the operating results of president from the acquisition date of september   whereas the subsequent year ended january   includes the operating results of president for the entire year

net income keebler s reportable segments are branded and specialty  which were determined using keebler s method of internal reporting  which divides and analyzes the business by sales channel 
the reportable segments represent an aggregation of similar sales channels 
we evaluate the performance of the reportable segments and allocate resources based on the segment s profit contribution  defined as earnings before certain functional support costs  amortization  interest and income taxes 
while the accounting policies for each reportable segment are the same as for the total company  the cost of sales used to determine a segment s profit contribution is calculated using standard costs for each product  whereas actual cost of sales is used to determine consolidated income from operations 
branded segment the branded segment sells a number of well recognized products  primarily to retail outlets such as supermarkets  mass merchandisers  warehouse club stores  convenience stores and drug stores  as well as to private label retailers 
years ended january  january  january  in millions net sales    profit contribution net sales in the branded segment grew in to  million versus  million in the acquisition of president contributed million or to total net revenues in  compared to fourteen weeks totaling just of overall net sales in volume gains of in the keebler core business  which exclude sales attributed to the president acquisition  together with the national distribution of famous amos and murray sugar free cookies  significantly contributed to the top line growth 
new products introduced under our keebler and cheez it brands during included keebler double fudge and caramel cookies  keebler rainbow vanilla wafers and keebler walnut chips deluxe cookies 
growth in the cheez it brand was realized through the introduction of cheez it hot spicy and cheez it get nutty snack mix 
multiple variations of our single serve snack size products  both in new products and the cheez it brand  also drove the sales increases 
sales growth also benefited from price increases taken in the branded segment earlier in the year 
partially offsetting the favorable revenue growth was a shift in the sales mix in mass merchandisers away from frequent  low margin promotional activities  to a more profitable  consistent distribution focus 
net sales in increased to  million as compared to  million in  with the acquisition of president contributing million in incremental revenue 
adjusting to an equal number of selling days in and before including the acquisition growth in  branded revenues grew over the prior year 
the primary drivers of the increase were higher sales of products under both the keebler and cheez it brands 
the keebler brand name was used to leverage new product introductions through line extensions such as the keebler peanut butter fudge sticks 
the growth in cheez it sales was partly attributed to new products such as cheez it heads and tails  cheez it sandwich crackers and cheez it snack mix 
additionally  we redirected marketing support into brand building advertising and consumer promotions 
a favorable sales mix of keebler branded products  combined with selected price increases  also generated higher revenues 
further contributing to the improvement was continued revenue growth outside supermarkets  such as in mass merchandisers  convenience and club stores 
profit contribution for the branded segment was million and million for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
the profit contribution surpassed the prior year mainly due to a higher gross profit on keebler core products  incremental volume associated with a full year of sales of president products and several cost reduction programs designed to improve efficiencies and reduce distribution costs 
the gross profit on keebler core products increased percentage points in  achieving  as a percentage of net sales 
the branded segment s profit contribution was million above the prior year 
after removing the impact of president  profit contribution was of net sales  which represented a percentage point increase over a higher gross profit and lower distribution expenses drove the improvement 
the benefit noted in gross profit was attributed to improved sales mix  selected price increases and continued productivity gains in our bakeries 
lower distribution expenses were due to more fully utilizing available trailer capacity and productivity and cost savings programs designed to minimize inventory losses 
specialty segment the specialty segment produces cookies and crackers for the foodservice market  custom baked products for other marketers of branded food products  including sales of cookies to the girl scouts of the usa  and preformed pie crusts 
this segment also imports and distributes carr s crackers in the us under an exclusive long term licensing and distribution agreement with united biscuits 
years ended january  january  january  in millions net sales profit contribution the specialty segment recorded revenues of million in  million higher than the inclusion of president for a full year contributed million to net sales  which was million greater than revenue growth of achieved in the core specialty business  which excludes sales attributed to the president acquisition  was driven by volume increases of custom baked products for other marketers of branded food products 
additionally  sales in the foodservice market were favorably impacted by volume gains  which occurred principally in the last half of the year  combined with the earlier in the year benefit of prior year price increases 
these higher sales were partially offset by reduced sales of preformed pie crusts  due to a soft pie crust market 
before including the million of sales attributed to president in  and after adjusting to an equal number of selling days  revenues finished million below the decrease in net sales was principally associated with lower margin products that were either subsequently discontinued or re positioned at higher price levels 
profit contribution in the specialty segment increased million to million in excluding the impact of president  the profit contribution of  as a percentage of net sales  declined million due to a change in the sales mix  which was heavily weighted toward custom baked products  that carry a higher cost of sales 
the benefits from cost reduction programs were not enough to offset the effects of increased production of lower margin products and higher marketing expenses 
excluding president  profit contribution was of net sales in  compared to in the improvement in profit contribution was primarily achieved by a more profitable sales mix  selected price increases and productivity gains received through bakery automation projects and supply chain initiatives in distribution and inventory management 
cost of sales cost of sales was  million  or of net sales in  compared to million  or of net sales in the increase  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  was primarily caused by the inclusion of president for a full year compared to only fourteen weeks in excluding the impact of president  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in year over year comparisons resulted from the benefits received on productivity and cost savings programs designed to improve efficiency at our manufacturing facilities  as well as from other cost reduction initiatives 
cost of sales was also favorably impacted by lower raw and packaging material costs in each respective year 
in  the benefits generated by these lower costs were partially offset by a change in the production mix to include more products sourced outside of the keebler manufacturing network  which generally carry a higher cost than internally produced products 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses of  million in  were million greater than  but percentage points favorable  as a percentage of net sales 
in addition to the inclusion of president expenses for a full year in  as compared to just fourteen weeks in  higher selling  marketing and administrative expenses were also experienced as a result of core keebler volume growth 
after removing the expenses contributed by president  selling  marketing and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in  compared to in total marketing expenses increased as we continued our focus on building brand equity and incremental trade promotion programs were instituted in support of the national distribution of famous amos and murray sugar free cookies 
despite higher sales levels in  more efficient marketing programs resulted in a lower rate of marketing expenses  as a percentage of net sales 
in addition  increased administrative expenses were incurred in  due principally to higher compensation costs resulting from growth in the core keebler business 
net increases in selling and distribution expenses resulting from volume gains were lower than expected  as savings were achieved through a more efficient selling and distribution network 
in  selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million higher than  however  percentage points better as a percentage of net sales 
after removing million of expenses attributable to president  selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million above the prior year 
higher marketing expenses related to our continued focus on building brand equity through advertising and consumer promotions was the primary driver of the increased spending 
partially offsetting these higher marketing expenses were savings achieved in distribution costs due to improved inventory handling and deployment 
other other expense was million in  compared to million in and million in the increases for both and were driven by incremental amortization expense resulting from the addition of over million of intangible assets from the president acquisition in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the higher current year spending  were various fees and costs of million associated with the selling of accounts receivable under the receivables purchase agreement agreement 
these higher costs were partially offset by million of income recorded to recognize the mark to market of an interest rate swap that no longer served as a hedge in restructuring and impairment charge as part of the continuing process of integrating the business of president into our operations  on may   keebler announced the decision to close its manufacturing facility in sayreville  new jersey due to excess capacity within the company s plant manufacturing network 
as a result  a pre tax restructuring and impairment charge to operating income of million was recorded in the restructuring and impairment charge included million for cash costs related to severance and other exit costs from the sayreville facility 
the remaining million was non cash charges for asset impairments related to the sayreville closing  including write downs of property  plant and equipment at sayreville and equipment at other locations  and a proportionate reduction of goodwill acquired in the acquisition of sunshine in june the impairment charge for equipment at other locations resulted from a combination of factors 
the acquisition of president brought a new capability to keebler s production network 
the president baking process is principally based on shorter  more flexible ovens compared to the larger ovens common to keebler and sunshine bakeries 
this new capability resulted in a comprehensive analysis of system wide production needs 
the acquisition and resulting exit plans of keebler  sunshine and president  when considered together  resulted in redundant productive equipment  which ultimately became idle 
the original million charge recorded in the second quarter of was reduced by a fourth quarter adjustment of million 
the adjustment was for costs related to severance and other exit costs from the facility due to lower than expected severance costs and an earlier than expected disposal of the facility 
of the total million charge  approximately million was recorded as plant and facility closing costs and severance  with the remaining million recorded as other liabilities and accruals 
approximately employees were expected to be terminated as a result of the closing of the sayreville facility  of which approximately employees were represented by unions 
at january   approximately employees under union contract and approximately employees not under union contract have been terminated 
at january   million remained for plant and facility closing costs and severance accruals and million for other liabilities and accruals 
substantially all of the remaining severance liability is expected to be spent in  as nearly all employees have been terminated 
production at the sayreville  new jersey manufacturing facility ceased on september  spending for exit costs associated with the closure of the facility will continue into the year as the facility is prepared for sale 
spending for exit costs related to the facility closure is expected to continue for eighteen months or until the facility is disposed of  whichever occurs earlier 
the amount of suspended depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized for the year ended january   if the impairments had not been recognized  was approximately million  with million of annualized savings anticipated in interest expense  net net interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the overall higher average debt balance outstanding as a result of the president acquisition late in the debt incurred from the president acquisition  less quarterly principal payments  was outstanding for the full year as compared to only three months in the president acquisition also caused a reduction in the average invested cash balance in  which resulted in lower interest income as compared to interest expense declined in from  despite the million of additional debt incurred from the acquisition of president  due to lower interest rates  fees and favorable terms 
in conjunction with the president acquisition  the million outstanding balance on the term note was extinguished  also contributing to the reduction in interest expense 
additionally  each year has benefited from favorable interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate was percentage points lower than the previous year and the weighted average interest rate was percentage points lower than income tax expense income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of in  in and in in each year  the effective tax rate exceeded the statutory rate due to nondeductible expenses  principally amortization of intangibles  including trademarks  trade names  other intangibles and goodwill 
the increase in nondeductible expenses  mainly a full year amortization period for the president intangibles and the goodwill impairment related to the closure of the sayreville  new jersey facility  was the principal reason for the percentage point increase in the effective tax rate in  as compared to the percentage point increase in the effective tax rate from to was due primarily to the increase in nondeductible expenses  principally the amortization of intangibles  resulting from the president acquisition 
in  the previously established valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  was eliminated as part of effecting a change in the tax basis of the assets and liabilities that resulted from the keebler acquisition 
previously  pursuant to the terms of the keebler acquisition  the predecessor company retained the right to use the net operating losses for potential carrybacks 
any unused operating losses would then be available to keebler  but were significantly restricted under current tax law 
as such  we carried a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at january  and january  to fully reserve all net operating loss carryforwards due to the past uncertainty of their realization 
the ability of the predecessor company to use these net operating losses is now considered unlikely  and therefore  their realization by keebler was more likely than not 
in addition  we sought and successfully obtained permission from the internal revenue service to value the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the keebler acquisition in accordance with internal revenue code section in conjunction with filing amended tax returns to effect the change in the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  all net operating loss carryforwards were utilized 
extraordinary item net of income taxes in the latter part of  an after tax extraordinary charge of million was recorded for the write off of unamortized bank fees related to the early extinguishment of the term note 
similarly  in we also recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of income taxes  with million of the charge related to the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the early retirement of term loans 
the additional million after tax extraordinary charge was recorded due to a loss on the early extinguishment of the seller note  which was entered into at the time of the keebler acquisition 
there were no extraordinary charges recorded in net income net income for was million  which when compared to net income was million lower 
the decrease was primarily due to a million after tax restructuring and impairment charge that was recorded in excluding the restructuring and impairment charge  net income of million in was up over the improvement in net earnings  before considering the restructuring and impairment charge  reflects growth due to the inclusion of the president business for a full year  growth in the keebler core business and the benefits of productivity and cost savings programs 
in  net income of million was higher than the prior year of million 
the substantial growth in net earnings in year over year comparisons was achieved through revenue gains combined with lower operating expenses resulting from productivity and cost savings programs 
liquidity and capital resources a condensed cash flow statement of keebler follows years ended in millions january  january  january  cash provided from used by operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flow for for the year ended january   operating activities provided million of cash 
net earnings contributed million to the growth 
an increase in trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of million  along with higher income taxes payable of million also contributed to the positive cash flow 
higher trade accounts payable and current liabilities were driven by increased purchases of production related inputs  as well as from higher marketing accruals 
income taxes payable increased principally due to the timing of income tax payments 
somewhat offsetting the favorable cash flow position were higher levels of inventory 
in addition  trade accounts and notes receivable  before accounting for the securitization of receivables  increased primarily from a shift in the timing of sales to later in the year  as well as reduced cash collections resulting from the timing of our year end date  which coincided with the bank s holiday schedule 
included in operating activities was the restructuring and impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of  which included million relating to the non cash write down of impaired property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  while the remaining portion of the charge related to cash costs 
during  investing activities used a total of million 
spending on capital projects of million was principally for on going enhancement  capacity enrichments  automation expansion and numerous cost reduction programs at various manufacturing and distribution locations 
additional funds were also used for the implementation of new computer equipment at the president locations to install and support the sap r management information system  as well as year information technology compliance upgrades 
asset disposals  including the sale of the atlanta  georgia manufacturing facility and an idle muffin line  generated the majority of the million proceeds 
cash used by financing activities in totaled million 
the primary uses of cash in the year were for long term debt repayments to pay down million on the revolving facility  repay the million bridge facility and to make regularly scheduled principal payments of million 
also  million was used to repurchase common stock into treasury 
these uses of cash were partially offset by net cash proceeds of million received from the sale of accounts receivable under the receivables purchase agreement 
this agreement  which was initially entered into during the first quarter of the year  allowed funds to be borrowed at a lower cost to the company 
additionally  the million income tax benefit related to stock options exercised further reduced the total financing uses of cash  as did the million in cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during the year 
cash flow for and operating activities provided million of cash during  a million decrease from net earnings of million  together with a deferral of additional income taxes  were the primary drivers of the positive cash flow  while additional investments in accounts receivable and inventories utilized a portion of the cash flow generated from operations 
the addition of president s trade accounts receivable subsequent to the acquisition was the principal contributor to the higher trade accounts receivable balance 
a build in finished goods drove the additional investment in inventories in anticipation of the upcoming girl scout cookie selling season 
additionally  higher income tax payments attributable to a million increase in pre tax income over also used incremental operating cash 
spending on plant and facility closing costs and severance related to exit costs associated with recent acquisitions  while continuing to decline from prior years  accounted for million of cash used by operations 
exit cost spending associated with these acquisitions includes noncancelable lease obligations  which are expected to continue through cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash used by investing activities in was primarily attributable to the million  net of cash acquired  acquisition of president in september of that year 
capital spending increased million over to million 
new product modifications  updates and enhancements of production facilities and progress towards the achievement of near term cost savings and efficiencies in the manufacturing  sales and distribution process drove the increase in capital spending 
at year end  keebler held the idle atlanta  georgia manufacturing facility  a distribution center in kensington  connecticut and a warehouse in houston  texas for sale  and disposition of these facilities was expected to be completed before the end of in  financing activities generated million  which was million greater than in the increase in mainly resulted from proceeds of long term debt borrowings under million of available new debt financing used to fund the acquisition of president 
these cash sources were partially offset by the pre payment of the outstanding term note balance and a million repayment on the revolving facility 
in  however  financing activities resulted in a net use of million 
we entered into an amendment and restatement of our prior senior credit agreement  proceeds from which were used to extinguish existing term loans of million 
the extinguishment was funded primarily by a draw down on the revolving loan facility and million under the new term loan 
during  the draw down on the revolving loan facility was completely repaid 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we extinguished million of debt related to the seller note and made million in principal pre payments on the term loan using existing cash resources 
the increase in cash provided from financing activities in was also due to the receipt of million of cash proceeds resulting from bermore exercising a warrant in exchange for  shares of common stock at the time of our initial public offering 
employee stock options were also exercised during the year providing another million  while cash totaling million was used to repurchase common stock into treasury under the stock repurchase program 
capital resources in  our capital resources were provided by the million credit facility that existed at the end of in september  a change in our credit agreements was needed to accommodate the additional cash required for the acquisition of president 
in order to consummate the acquisition  we entered into the million credit facility consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term facility 
in addition  we also entered into a million bridge facility that was subsequently refinanced with a receivables purchase agreement on january  these new debt facilities replaced the previously available million revolving loan facility and an existing term loan which were outstanding in until the time of the president acquisition 
available borrowings under the revolving facility were million and million in and  respectively 
borrowings under the million revolving facility in were million  which were all repaid as of january   and in borrowings were million with million repaid as of january  there were no borrowings under the million revolving loan facility in capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  down million from the majority of capital spending in will be used for the continued improvement in automation to generate additional productivity and cost savings 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded by cash provided from operations and will continue at a level sufficient to support our strategies and operating needs 
historically  we have not paid dividends 
however  in the first quarter of  keebler s board of directors declared an initial quarterly dividend of per common share 
the existing credit facility and notes place limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on our common stock 
additionally  the credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants including a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio and cash flow coverage ratios 
in addition to these ratios  the credit agreement also requires us to meet net worth and interest coverage ratios 
in and  we met all financial covenants in each of our financing agreements 
total debt was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
current maturities on the total debt outstanding were million and million at such respective dates 
cash and cash equivalents on january  and january  were million and million  respectively 
we believe that available cash  as well as amounts available under our debt facilities  will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the new statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that the instruments be measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
however  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment to fasb statement no 
citing concerns about companies ability to both modify their information systems for year readiness and become educated with the new derivatives and hedging standard  the fasb has delayed the effective date on sfas no 
for one year  to fiscal years beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact sfas no 
may have on the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our net sales  net income and cash flow are affected by the timing of new product introductions  promotional activities  price increases and seasonal biases in the first quarter and second half of the year 
the first quarter bias results because substantially all sales of girl scout cookies occur in that quarter 
the bias in the second half of the year has been due to events and holidays such as back to school  thanksgiving and christmas 
the relative mix between cookie and cracker sales varies throughout the year with stronger cracker sales in the last quarter of the calendar year 
self insurance we purchase insurance coverage for workers compensation  as well as general  product and vehicle liability maintaining certain levels of retained risk self insured portion 
potential losses relating to claims under the self insured portion of the policies are accrued in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
there are no unasserted claims that require a reserve or disclosure in accordance with sfas no 
year issue the year issue arose because many existing computer programs used only the last two digits to refer to a year 
as a result  computer programs may not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many businesses were at risk for possible computer application miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in business operations 
these risks were commonly referred to as the yk issues 
we performed a comprehensive review of our computer systems and non information systems to identify potential yk issues because we utilize software and related technologies that were anticipated to be impacted by the date change in the year our sap r enterprise wide information systems sap and manugistics software were developed purchased as yk compliant 
additionally  a complete simulation of the sap production environment was conducted in the second quarter of and the overall success revealed that the risk factors for potential issues in the year were minimal for the sap environment 
our secondary information systems  which are not material to our ability to forecast  manufacture or deliver product  were also corrected or upgraded where needed 
we completed our plan to test all business critical systems before the end of the third quarter of and this testing did not indicate any yk issues 
additionally  the results of a comprehensive questionnaire sent to our significant vendors and suppliers indicated that they all intended to be yk compliant prior to the end of we also developed a contingency plan to address potential critical yk issues caused internally or by a third party  however  this contingency plan was not needed 
we incurred costs of million in for becoming yk compliant  which were entirely funded by cash provided from operations and expensed as incurred 
this spending was exclusive of yk issues regarding the president acquisition 
many of the yk risks at president were mitigated through our implementation of the sap and manugistics software at president facilities in  however  additional spending of million was incurred to correct and upgrade president s secondary information systems in order to make them yk compliant 
as of the date of this filing  we have not experienced any yk failures with our internal systems or equipment  nor have we detected any yk problems affecting any third parties 
we will continue to monitor our information systems  facilities  equipment and relationships with third parties regarding the yk issue 
although we believe our efforts to address yk issues have been adequate  there can be no certainty that failures or problems related to yk may not develop in the future 
also  we cannot guarantee that we will not experience unanticipated consequences by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems or those of significant third parties 
however  we believe no such failure or problem is reasonably likely to materially disrupt our business 
the above discussion of our efforts and expectations relating to yk compliance is forward looking based on our best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this discussion should be read in conjunction with our disclosure under the heading forward looking statements that follows below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed that may adversely affect results of operations and financial position include changes in future interest rates and raw material prices 
we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements and commodity futures and options contracts 
the use of these instruments is limited to hedging activities and they are not entered for trading or speculative purposes 
these agreements and contracts are entered into at a corporate level and as such  any income or expense associated with these transactions is not allocated to our reportable segments 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
our current debt structure consists of both fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swap agreements are used to effectively manage changes in interest rates related to the majority of our borrowings with the objective of reducing overall interest costs 
sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact that changes in market prices have on the fair value of interest rate swap agreements 
assuming a ten percent increase in market price  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at january   with a notional amount of million  would increase the net receivable to million  while the impact of a ten percent decrease in market price would reduce the net receivable to million 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at january   with an assumed ten percent increase in market price and the notional amount of million  would increase the net receivable to million  while the impact of a ten percent decrease in market price would result in a net payable of million 
during  an interest rate swap that no longer served as a hedge  with a notional amount of million  was recognized in income from operations with a marked to market fair value of million 
we enter into commodity futures and options contracts to neutralize the impact of price increases on raw material purchases that are not likely to be recovered through higher prices on our products 
we also used sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact on the fair value of commodity futures and options contracts 
assuming a ten percent increase or decrease in market price  the fair value of open contracts with a notional amount of million at january  would be impacted by million 
assuming a ten percent increase or decrease in market price  the fair value of open contracts with a notional amount of million at january  would be impacted by million
