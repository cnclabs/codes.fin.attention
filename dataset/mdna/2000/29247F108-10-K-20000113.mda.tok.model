item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company was incorporated in january and commenced operations in march as a reseller of information technology products 
the company began emphasizing its value added services to its customers in fiscal value added services accounted for of the company s net sales in fiscal the gross profit margins on the value added services that the company currently offers are significantly higher than the gross profit margins on the company s information technology products reselling business 
firstsource 
com  an internet and call center based business to business provider of products  services and information necessary to operate small to medium sized businesses  began operations in june of as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in july of  through a private placement of firstsource 
com s common stock  million of additional capital was raised 
total shares issued in connection with the private placement were  which reduced the company s ownership interest to 
the company s net sales have increased from million in fiscal the company s first full year of operations to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
the growth in net sales has principally been driven by sales to new customers and increased sales to existing customers as well as geographic expansion through the opening of additional sales offices 
the company s gross profit margins expanded in earlier years from in fiscal to in fiscal  but contracted to in fiscal  principally from highly competitive market pressures 
because of the tighter margins  there has not been sufficient gross margins to provide for the disproportionately larger operating expenses of million before allocation to minority interest related to firstsource 
com  and for the non recurring charges of million 
a major factor in the increase in firstsource 
com s operating expenses was million of non cash expense related to the issuance of stock options see discussion in general and administrative comparison section 
most of the non recurring charges related to the impairment charge of million for the ontario facility see following discussion 
thus  the company incurred its first operating loss of million in fiscal in june  the company completed construction of its  square foot ontario facility 
the company believed the facility would enable it to compete in what it believed would be an emerging market for final assembly of certain computer products being performed by third parties  including corporate resellers and distributors  rather than being done in house under the build to forecast methodology traditionally employed by computer manufacturers 
as this market developed  it became apparent that certain manufacturers would require distributors to co locate their final assembly operations at the manufacturer s facility instead of outsourcing final assembly to distributors at a separate site 
in reaction to the change in this emerging market  in january  the company decided to sell and leaseback the ontario facility  continuing the product configuration operation 
during the quarter ended march  the company recorded an impairment charge of million against operations to write down the net book value of its ontario facility to its estimated fair value 
the write down was determined using the held for use model contained in sfas no 
at the time of the sale leaseback  it was the intent of the company to sublease approximately of the facility space to an unrelated party 
however  no sublease has been executed to date and the company continues to evaluate its options with regard to the use of the excess space 
because the company s business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  the company does not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
the company typically does not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to the company s configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of the company s net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although the company maintains a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  it records as inventory the merchandise being configured and products purchased from distributors  but not yet shipped to customers 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment and satisfaction of significant vendor obligations  if any 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by the company s distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits 
the company s effective tax rate varied significantly from the statutory rate in the current fiscal year 
this was attributable principally to net operating losses generated by firstsource 
com that could not be utilized by the company due to a reduction in ownership that precluded consolidation for tax filing purposes

recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the aicpa issued sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop no 
requires that all start up costs related to new operations must be expensed as incurred

is adopted 
the company does not expect the adoption of sop no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company will be required to implement sop no 
in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets  or liabilities in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the planned use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
because the company does not currently hold any derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
is not currently expected to have a material impact on results of operations or financial position 
sfas no 
defers the effective date of sfas no 
until all fiscal years beginning after june  item a 
quantative and qualitive disclosures about market risk

the company s lines of credit bear interest at the prime rate less 
assuming an increase of one half a percentage point in the lenders prime rate on october  and no change in the outstanding borrowings under the lines of credit at september   interest expense would increase by approximately  for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year
