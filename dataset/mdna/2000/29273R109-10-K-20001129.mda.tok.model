item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  as well as some statements by heritage in periodic press releases  include certain forward looking statements 
although heritage believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future events  no assurance can be given that every objective will be reached 
such statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of as required by that law  heritage hereby identifies the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted or estimated by heritage in forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  among other things o changes in general economic conditions in the united states as well as changes in general economic conditions and currencies in foreign countries  o weather conditions that vary significantly from historically normal conditions  o the general level of petroleum product demand  and the availability of propane supplies  o energy prices generally and specifically  the price of propane to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels  o competition from other propane distributors and alternate fuels  o the availability and cost of capital  o changes in laws and regulations to which heritage is subject  including tax  environmental and employment regulations  o the costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings against heritage or which may be brought against heritage  o the ability of heritage to sustain its historical levels of internal growth  and o the ability of heritage to continue to locate and acquire other propane companies at purchase prices that are accretive to its financial results 
weather and seasonality heritage s propane distribution business is seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in its service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements  which generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes 
heritage propane partners  lp and subsidiaries formerly peoples gas company and surviving legal entity in the series of transactions with us propane general peoples gas engaged in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
revenues are derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
peoples gas believes that prior to the series of transactions with atmos  agl  piedmont and predecessor heritage  it was among the top retail propane marketers nationally and was the largest independent propane distributor in florida 
at the time of the merger  peoples gas was serving more than  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in the florida peninsula 
in august  teco energy  inc  atmos energy corporation  piedmont natural gas company  inc and agl resources  inc 
contributed each company s propane operations  peoples gas company peoples gas  united cities propane gas  inc united cities  piedmont propane company piedmont  and agl propane  inc agl  respectively  to us propane  us us propane in exchange for equity interests in us propane 
the merger was accounted for as an acquisition using the purchase method of accounting with peoples gas being the accounting acquirer 
in august  us propane acquired all of the outstanding common stock of heritage holdings  inc  heritage propane partner  lp s general partner  for million 
by virtue of heritage holdings  inc s general partner and limited partner interests in heritage propane partners  lp  lp propane gained control of heritage propane partners  lp simultaneously  lp propane transferred its propane operations  consisting of its interest in four separate limited liability companies  agl propane  llc  peoples gas company  llc  united cities propane gas  llc and retail propane company  llc former piedmont operations to heritage propane partners  lp for million plus working capital 
the million was payable million in cash  million of assumed debt  and the issuance of  common units of heritage propane partners  lp valued at million and a percent limited partnership interest in heritage operating  lp valued at million 
the purchase price and the issuance price for the common units were approved by an independent committee of the board of directors of heritage holdings  inc the issuance price for the common units was per unit under a formula based on the average closing price of heritage propane partners  lp s common units on the new york stock exchange for the twenty day period beginning ten days prior to the public announcement of the transaction on june  the working capital adjustment is anticipated to be settled in december the formation of us propane and the merger with predecessor heritage affect the comparability of the eight months ended august  and august   because the volumes and results of operations for the period from august  through august  include the volumes and results of operations of agl  united cities  piedmont and predecessor heritage 
the increases in the line items discussed below are a result of these transactions 
amounts discussed below reflect percent of the results of m p energy partnership during the period from august  through august  m p energy partnership is a general partnership in which heritage owns a percent interest 
because m p energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to heritage s net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda calculation

heritage propane partners  lp and subsidiaries predecessor heritage the propane operations of heritage propane partners  lp  prior to the series of transactions with us propane general predecessor heritage engaged in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
predecessor heritage derived its revenue primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes that predecessor heritage was the seventh largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold prior to the series of transactions with us propane  serving almost  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states through over retail outlets 
the general partner believes that after the us propane transactions  heritage is the fourth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold  serving almost  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states through over retail outlets 
since its formation in  predecessor heritage grew primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
through august   predecessor heritage completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
predecessor heritage completed of these acquisitions since its initial public offering on june  during the period between august  and august   heritage completed two additional acquisitions 
annual retail propane sales volumes in gallons for predecessor heritage were million for the period ended august  and million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the retail propane business of predecessor heritage consisted principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel that burns in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
the retail propane distribution business is largely seasonal due to propane s use as a heating source in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of predecessor heritage s retail propane volume and in excess of percent of predecessor heritage s ebitda was attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits were concentrated in predecessor heritage s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flow from operations  however  was generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
a substantial portion of predecessor heritage s propane was used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in predecessor heritage s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on their financial performance 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
heritage therefore uses information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations  which assumes that normal weather will prevail in each of the regions in which it operates 
the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce gross profits 
in the past  predecessor heritage generally attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
predecessor heritage had on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities for future resale 
gross profit margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
analysis of historical results of operations predecessor heritage the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of predecessor heritage should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial and operating data and notes thereto  and the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
the following discussion reflects for the periods indicated the results of operations and operating data for predecessor heritage 
most of the increases in the line items discussed below result from the acquisitions made by predecessor heritage during the periods discussed 
during the period ended august   predecessor heritage completed acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in fiscal  predecessor heritage consummated six acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in fiscal  predecessor heritage consummated seven acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
these acquisitions affect the comparability of prior period financial matters  as the volumes are not included in the prior period s results of operations 
amounts discussed below reflect percent of the results of m p energy partnership  a general partnership in which predecessor heritage owns a percent interest 
because m p energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to predecessor heritage s net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda calculation 
as a result of the series of transactions between predecessor heritage and u 
s propane  the results of predecessor heritage are included in the results of heritage beginning august the period september  to august  compared to fiscal year the following discussion compares the period september  to august   an approximate eleven month period for predecessor heritage to its full fiscal year ended august  the pro forma amounts include the stand alone results of predecessor heritage without the effect of the series of transactions with us propane 
volume 
predecessor heritage sold million retail gallons during the period ended august   an increase of million gallons or percent from the million gallons sold in fiscal primarily as a result of acquisitions 
the increases in volumes were net of the effects of one of the warmest winters this century 
the pro forma retail gallons for predecessor heritage sold through august  were approximately million  an increase of million gallons or percent as compared to fiscal predecessor heritage also sold approximately million wholesale gallons during the period ended august   a increase of million gallons from fiscal s million gallons 
the increase in the wholesale volumes was attributable to the net of an increase of million gallons in the foreign operations of m p energy partnership and the decline of 
million gallons in the us wholesale operations 
revenues 
total revenues for predecessor heritage increased million or percent to million for the period ended august  as compared to million for fiscal the current period s domestic retail propane revenues increased million or percent to million as compared to fiscal s results of million due to increased volumes and higher selling prices

other revenues increased million or percent to million as a result of acquisitions and internal growth 
foreign revenues increased million for the period ended august   to million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august   primarily as a result of higher selling prices and to a lesser degree  increased volume 
sales price per gallon during the period ended august  continued to remain above last year s level due to the higher cost of propane  which was passed through to customers  as compared to the same period last year 
total revenues included million of trading activity for the period ended august   which predecessor heritage did not have last fiscal year 
the pro forma results for predecessor heritage for the period ended august   would reflect total revenues of approximately million  an million increase or percent as compared to fiscal this pro forma amount includes million of trading revenues  which are new to predecessor heritage as of july  cost of sales 
total cost of sales increased million or percent to million for the period ended august  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  this increase is the result of a significant increase in the wholesale propane prices which began increasing during the first fiscal quarter as compared to the low wholesale costs experienced in the fiscal year ended august   the increase in gallons sold and million of trading cost of sales which were not included in fiscal cost of sales 
retail fuel cost of sales increased million or percent to million during the period ended august   compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  foreign wholesale cost of sales also reflected an increase  increasing from million for the fiscal year ended august  to million for the period ended august  due to the impact of the increase in the cost of propane and increased volumes in this area 
u 
s 
wholesale cost of sales increased 
million as a result of the higher cost of fuel 
other cost of sales also increased 
million due to an increase in other revenues 
the pro forma cost of sales for the period ended august   for predecessor heritage is approximately million  of which million represents trading cost of sales that are not included in fiscal cost of sales 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or percent to million for the period ended august   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  due to the increases in volumes sold and revenues discussed above  offset by the increase in product costs 
the pro forma gross profit for predecessor heritage for the twelve months ended august  is approximately million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august   an increase of million or percent 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or percent to million in the period ended august  as compared to million in the fiscal year ended august  primarily due to acquisition related operating expenses

selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the period ended august   a decrease of 
million from the million reported for the fiscal year ended august  selling  general and administrative expenses for the pro forma period ended august  for predecessor heritage were approximately million  a 
million increase over fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million for the period ended august  to million as compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase is primarily the result of additional depreciation and amortization cost on the fixed assets and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
pro forma depreciation and amortization for the period ended august  was approximately million 
operating income 
operating income for the period ended august  decreased million to million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended august  the pro forma operating income for predecessor heritage for the period ended august  was million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization related to acquisitions  as well as lower volumes in existing operations as a result of unusually warm weather 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million or percent to million for the period ended august  as compared to million for the twelve month ended august  the increase was primarily due to borrowings related to acquisitions and to lesser extent  increased borrowings as a result of higher product costs 
interest expense for the pro forma twelve month period ended august   was approximately million  a million increase over fiscal s interest expense 
net income 
net income for the period ended august  was million as compared to the net income of million for the fiscal year ended august  the million decrease is the result of the decrease in operating income described above together with an increase in interest costs

earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the period ended august   as compared to fiscal s ebitda of million 
the pro forma ebitda for predecessor heritage for the twelve months ended august  was million 
heritage s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of m p energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating heritage s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
predecessor heritage sold million retail gallons in fiscal  an increase of million gallons or percent from the million gallons sold in fiscal primarily as a result of acquisitions 
the increases in volumes were net of the effects of one of the warmest winters this century 
predecessor heritage also sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal  a decrease of million gallons from fiscal s million gallons 
the decrease in the wholesale volumes was attributable to a decline of million gallons in the foreign operations of m p energy partnership and the decline of million gallons in the us wholesale operations 
the warm weather this past heating season was the main factor in the decline in these volumes 
revenues 
total revenues for predecessor heritage decreased million to million from fiscal total revenues of million 
retail fuel revenues increased million to million while domestic wholesale fuel revenues decreased million and foreign wholesale revenues decreased million 
the increase in retail fuel revenues due to increased volumes was partially offset by the effects of lower cost of fuel in fiscal year the decreases in the us and foreign wholesale revenues correspond primarily to the decrease in volumes 
other revenues increased million primarily as a result of acquisitions and to a lesser extent internal growth 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased million  or percent to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for fiscal year ended august  domestic cost of sales decreased million  or percent to million and foreign cost of sales decreased million  or percent to million

domestic wholesale and foreign cost of sales both decreased due to the lower cost of fuel realized in fiscal and the decrease in volumes 
gross profit 
total gross profit for fiscal was million  a million increase or percent over fiscal s gross profit of million 
the reduction in the cost of fuel in fiscal year was the primary contributing factor in the increase in gross profit along with the increase in other revenues 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal increased million or percent to million as compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased costs related to acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased 
million or percent to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase was the result of additional expenses to support business growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for fiscal  a million increase over fiscal s million 
this increase is the result of additional depreciation and amortization costs on the fixed assets and intangibles recorded in relation to acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income increased percent to million in fiscal  a million increase over fiscal s million 
the increased gross profit described above offset by the increases in operating and other expenses  also described above  resulted in this increase 
net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended august   increased 
million  or percent to million as compared to fiscal s net income of million 
this increase is the result of increased operating income partially offset by increased interest costs related to acquisition debt 
ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million or percent to million for fiscal as compared to the restated ebitda of million 
fiscal s ebitda was restated to account for the non cash compensation expense that was previously included 
predecessor heritage s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of m p energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligation  but provides additional information for evaluating heritage s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of heritage to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of heritage are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities 
to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable b growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition bank line of credit  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by revolving acquisition bank line of credit  other lines of credit  long term debt  issues of additional common units or a combination thereof 
cash flows heritage propane partners  lp formerly peoples gas operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities during the period ended august   was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in the twelve months ended december  the net cash provided from operations for the period ended august  consisted of a net loss of million offset by the impact of working capital provided of million and noncash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
working capital items have increased over the period ended august  as a result of the net effect of the formation of us propane and the merger with predecessor heritage 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of the million spent in the formation of us propane 
heritage completed two acquisitions during the period from august  and august  spending million  net of cash received  to purchase the two propane companies 
in january  peoples gas purchased substantially all of the assets of a company for approximately million 
these capital expenditure amounts are reflected in the cash used in investing activities of million along with million spent for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels and customer tanks to support growth of operations and other investing activities of million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities during the period ended august  of million was primarily from the million received from the issuance of senior secured promissory notes in conjunction with the merger with us propane 
see description of indebtedness 
the proceeds were used in conjunction with the merger with us propane and to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition facility and a portion of the working capital facility assumed in the transaction with predecessor heritage

these increases were offset by debt issuance costs of million and dividends paid by peoples gas to their parent company of million 
cash flows predecessor heritage operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities during the period ended august   was million compared to cash provided of million in the twelve months ended august  the net cash provided from operations for the period ended august  consisted of net income of million and the impact of working capital used of million offset by noncash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
accounts receivable have increased over last year as a result of the net effect of the increase in propane costs which in part was passed on to the customers and a larger customer base due to acquisitions 
accounts payable has also increased due to the same related reasons of increased cost of propane and acquisitions 
investing activities 
predecessor heritage completed eleven acquisitions during the period ended august  spending million  net of cash received  to purchase propane companies 
this capital expenditure amount is reflected in the cash used in investing activities of million along with million spent for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels and customer tanks to support growth of operations 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities during the period ended august  of million is primarily the result of net proceeds received in a public offering of  common units of heritage propane partners  lp the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition facility that was incurred to acquire propane businesses 
other cash provided by financing activities of million was mainly from a net increase in the working capital facility of million and a net increase in the acquisition facility of million used to acquire other propane businesses 
these increases were offset by cash distributions to unitholders of million  payments on other long term debt of million and contributions by the general partner of 
million 
financing and sources of liquidity heritage has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes  and an acquisition facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and improvements 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
predecessor heritage used its cash provided by operating and financing activities to provide distributions to unitholders and to fund acquisition  maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for the period ended august  as compared to million for fiscal year and million during fiscal in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during the period ended august   million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during fiscal  million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
under its partnership agreement  heritage will distribute to its partners  days after the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount equal to all of its available cash for such quarter 
available cash generally means  with respect to any quarter of heritage  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the heritage s business  ii comply with applicable law or any heritage debt instrument or other agreement  or iii provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partner in respect of any one or more of the next four quarters 
available cash is more fully defined in the amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of heritage propane partners  lp previously filed as an exhibit 
distributions of available cash to the holders of the subordinated units and the class b subordinated units are subject to the prior rights of the holders of the common units to receive the minimum quarterly distributions of 
per unit for each quarter during the subordination period  and to receive any arrearages in the distribution of minimum quarterly distributions on the common units for prior quarters during the subordination period 

the subordination period will not end earlier than june  subordination period 
heritage s commitment to its unitholders is to distribute the increase in its cash flow while maintaining prudent reserves for operations 
heritage raised the quarterly distribution paid on october  for the fourth quarter ended august   to 
per unit or annually from the quarterly distribution of 
or annually 
the decision to increase the quarterly distribution resulted from a review of predecessor heritage s past financial performance and current projections for available cash due to the merger between us propane and heritage 
the current distribution level includes incentive distributions payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds 
per unit annually 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time nor complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  heritage does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  heritage has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk heritage has very little cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations 
predecessor heritage primarily entered into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
predecessor heritage s long term debt instruments were typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt obligations mature  heritage may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the propane inventory that heritage buys and sells 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to predecessor heritage s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
in order to help ensure adequate supply sources are available to heritage during periods of high demand  predecessor heritage in the past has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities 
heritage also attempts to minimize the effects of market price fluctuations for its propane supply through its trading activities and by entering into certain financial contracts 
heritage s trading activities include both purchases and sales of product supply 
trading activity is recorded at fair value on heritage s balance sheet  with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
the financial contracts entered into by heritage are often referred to as swap instruments 
the swap instruments are a contractual agreement to exchange obligations of money between the buyer and seller of the instruments as propane volumes during the pricing period are purchased 
the swaps are tied to a fixed price bid by the buyer and a floating price determination for the seller based on certain indices at the end of the relevant trading period 
heritage enters into these swap instruments to hedge the projected propane volumes to be purchased during each of the one month periods during the projected heating season 
at august   heritage had outstanding propane hedges swap agreements for a total of million gallons of propane at a weighted average price of 
per gallon 
the fair value of the swap agreement is the amount at which they could be settled  based on quoted market prices 
at august   heritage would have received approximately million to terminate the swap agreements then in place 
heritage continues to monitor propane prices and may enter into additional propane hedges in the future 
inherent in the portfolio from the trading activities are certain business risks  including market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the risk that the value of the portfolio will change  either favorably or unfavorably  in response to changing market conditions 
credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers  customers  or financial counterparties to a contract 
heritage takes an active role in managing and controlling market and credit risk and has established control procedures  which are reviewed on an ongoing basis 
heritage monitors market risk through a variety of techniques  including routine reporting to senior management 
heritage attempts to minimize credit risk exposure through credit policies and periodic monitoring procedures 
trading activities heritage trades financial instruments for its own account through its wholly owned subsidiary  heritage energy resources resources 
financial instruments utilized in connection with trading activities are accounted for using the mark to market method 
under the mark to market method of accounting  forwards  swaps  options and storage contracts are reflected at fair value  and are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities from trading activities 
unrealized gains and losses from the financial contracts and the impact of price movements are recognized in the income statement  as other income expense 
changes in the assets and liabilities from trading activities result primarily from changes in the market prices  newly originated transactions and the timing of settlement related to the receipt of cash for certain contracts 
resources attempts to balance its contractual portfolio in terms of notional amounts and timing of performance and delivery obligations 
however  net unbalanced positions can exist or are established based on assessment of anticipated market movements 
heritage has recorded its trading activities at fair value in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf requires energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet  with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
notional amounts and terms the notional amounts and terms of these financial instruments as of august  include fixed price payor for thousand barrels and thousand barrels of propane and butane  respectively and fixed price receiver of thousand barrels and thousand barrels of propane and butane  respectively 
notional amounts reflect the volume of the transactions  but do not represent the amounts exchanged by the parties to the financial instruments 
accordingly  notional amounts do not accurately measure heritage s exposure to market or credit risks 
fair value the fair value of the financial instruments related to trading activities as of august   were assets of million and liabilities of million related to propane and butane 
the income related to trading activities for the period ended august   was 
million 
market and credit risk inherent in the resulting contractual portfolio is certain business risks  including market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the risk that the value of the portfolio will change  either favorably or unfavorably  in response to changing market conditions 
credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by suppliers  customers  or financial counterparties to a contract

heritage monitors market risk through a variety of techniques  including routine reporting to senior management 
heritage attempts to minimize credit risk exposure through credit policies and periodic monitoring procedures 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimate considering various factors including closing average spot prices for the current and outer months plus a differential to consider time value and storage costs
