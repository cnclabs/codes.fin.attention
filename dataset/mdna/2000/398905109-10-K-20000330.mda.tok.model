item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator and consolidator in the highly fragmented automotive retailing industry 
we own automobile dealership franchises located in texas  oklahoma  florida  new mexico  georgia  colorado  louisiana and massachusetts 
through our dealerships and internet sites  we sell new and used cars and light trucks  provide maintenance and repair services at all of our dealerships  and operate collision service centers 
we expect a significant portion of our future growth to come from acquisitions of additional dealerships 
we have diverse sources of revenues  including new car sales  new truck sales  used car sales  used truck sales  manufacturer remarketed vehicle sales  parts sales  service sales  collision repair services  finance fees  insurance commissions  vehicle service contract commissions  documentary fees and after market product sales 
sales revenues from new and used vehicle sales and parts and service sales include sales to retail customers  other dealerships and wholesalers 
other dealership revenue includes revenues from arranging financing  insurance and vehicle service contracts  net of a provision for anticipated chargebacks  and documentary fees 
our total gross margin varies as our merchandise mix the mix between new vehicle sales  used vehicle sales  parts and service sales  collision repair services and other dealership revenues changes 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services generally varies between approximately and  with new vehicle sales generally resulting in the lowest gross margin and other dealership revenue sales generally resulting in the highest gross margin 
when our new vehicle sales increase or decrease at a rate greater than our other revenue sources  our gross margin responds inversely 
factors such as seasonality  weather  cyclicality and manufacturers advertising and incentives may impact our merchandise mix  and therefore influence our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for sales  administrative  finance and general management personnel  rent  marketing  insurance and utilities 
interest expense consists of interest charges on interest bearing debt  including floorplan inventory financing  net of interest income earned 
until we acquired them  all of the dealerships had been managed as independent private companies and their results of operations reflect different tax structures s corporations and c corporations  which influenced  among other things  their historical levels of owners compensation 
certain of these owners and key employees agreed to reductions in their compensation and benefits in connection with their acquisition by us 
we are integrating certain functions and installing practices that have been successful at other franchises and in other retail segments best practices 
this integration of functions and installation of best practices may present opportunities to increase revenues and reduce costs but may also necessitate additional costs and expenditures for corporate administration  including expenses necessary to implement our acquisition strategy 
these various costs and possible cost savings and revenue enhancements may make historical operating results difficult to compare to and not indicative of  future performance

revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  new vehicle revenues increased primarily due to strong customer acceptance of our products  particularly chevrolet  ford  lexus and honda  and the acquisitions of additional dealership operations during and the growth in used vehicle revenues was primarily attributable to an emphasis on used vehicle sales in the houston and oklahoma markets  and the additional dealership operations acquired 
the increase in parts and service revenues was due to the additional dealership operations acquired  coupled with strong organic growth in the denver  houston and beaumont markets 
other dealership revenues increased primarily due to the implementation of our vehicle service contract and insurance programs  and related training  which resulted in improved revenues per unit  in addition to an increase in the number of retail new and used vehicle sales

floorplan and other interest expense  net  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the floorplan interest expense of the additional dealership operations acquired and borrowings to complete acquisitions 
a portion of the increase is due to the completion of our offering of million of senior subordinated notes during the first quarter of partially offsetting the increases was a basis point decline in the weighted average interest rate on our floorplan notes payable 
contributing to the rate decline was a rate reduction realized from obtaining a lower interest rate on our floorplan notes payable

partially offsetting the increases was a cost reduction realized from obtaining a lower interest rate on our floorplan notes payable 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash from operations  our credit facility which includes the floorplan facility and the acquisition facility and equity and debt offerings 
the following table sets forth historical selected information from our statements of cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities 
   net cash provided by financing activities    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows total cash and cash equivalents at december   were million 
operating activities 
for the three year period ended december   we generated million in net cash from operating activities  primarily driven by net income plus depreciation and amortization 
cash flow provided by operating activities increased million from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  excluding working capital changes  during cash flows from operating activities increased million over the prior year period 
investing activities 
the million of cash used for investing activities during was primarily attributable to cash paid in completing acquisitions  net of cash balances obtained in the acquisitions  and purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by sales of property and equipment 
during  we used approximately million in purchasing property and equipment  of which  approximately million was for the purchase of land and construction of facilities 
partially offsetting these uses of cash  we received million from sales of property and equipment 
the proceeds were received primarily from the sale of dealership properties to a reit for approximately million  and for which no gain or loss was recognized 
during  million was used in investing activities  primarily for acquisitions  net of cash received  and purchases of property and equipment  net of sales 
of the million used in purchasing property and equipment during  approximately million related to the purchase of land and construction of facilities for new or expanded operations 
during december  we completed the sale and leaseback of six dealership properties and received million in gross proceeds from the sale  for which no gain or loss was recognized 
financing activities 
we obtained approximately million  million and million from financing activities during the years  and  respectively 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from our march offerings of million shares of common stock and million of senior subordinated notes 
the net proceeds from these offerings  approximately million  were used to repay million borrowed under the acquisition portion of the credit facility  with the remainder of the proceeds being used in completing acquisitions during additionally  in connection with the sale of properties to a reit  we paid off mortgages of approximately million 
the net cash provided during was generated primarily from drawings on our credit facility and was utilized in completing acquisitions and supporting increased sales volumes 
partially offsetting the million in borrowings was million in principal payments on long term debt  of which million was related to the payoff of mortgages in connection with the sale and leaseback transaction completed in december the net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our initial public offering of approximately million  offset primarily by the pay down of floorplan debt in the amount of million 
working capital 
at december   we had working capital of million 
historically  we have funded our operations with internally generated cash flow and borrowings 
while we cannot guarantee it  based on current facts and circumstances  management believes we have adequate cash flow coupled with borrowings under our credit facility to fund our current operations 
acquisition financing we anticipate that our primary use of cash will be for the completion of acquisitions 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from the operating cash flows of our existing dealerships  borrowings under our current credit facilities  other borrowings or equity or debt offerings 
although we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund acquisitions  we cannot guarantee that such capital will be available to us at the time it is required or on terms acceptable to us 
see cautionary statement about forward looking statements 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures exclusive of new or expanded operations have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities  generally  are driven by new franchises being awarded to us by a manufacturer or significant growth in sales at an existing facility 
although we believe that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund capital expenditures  we cannot guarantee that such capital will be available to us at the time it is required or on terms acceptable to us 
credit facility in october  we amended our credit facility to increase the commitment from million to billion and to extend the term of the credit facility from december to december the credit facility provides a floorplan facility of million for financing vehicle inventories and an acquisition facility of million for financing acquisitions  general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
currently  million is available to be drawn under the acquisition facility  subject to a cash flow calculation and the maintenance of certain financial ratios and various covenants 
the credit facility also limits the amount we may pay as cash dividends 
in january  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
this swap converts the interest rate on million of debt to a fixed rate of approximately 
sale of dealership properties to a reit during  we entered into an agreement with a reit to sell certain of our dealership properties 
in connection with the sale of the properties  we have agreed to leaseback the properties under leases with terms of years  with tenant termination options after  and years 
as of december   we had closed the sale of six properties to the reit  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  for approximately million 
during  we sold two additional properties to the reit for approximately million 
we generally seek to avoid the ownership of real property 
accordingly we intend to continue to enter into sale and leaseback transactions in order to minimize our investment in acquired and constructed facilities 
leases we lease various real estate  facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements  including leases with related parties 
generally  the related party leases have terms of years and are renewable at our option years from execution of the lease and at the end of each subsequent five year period 
typically  the third party leases also have year terms  but are cancelable after an initial year period and at the end of each subsequent five year period 
cautionary statement about forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements appear in a number of places in this annual report and include statements regarding our plans  beliefs or current expectations  including those plans  beliefs and expectations of our officers and directors with respect to  among other things o future acquisitions  o expected future cost savings  o future capital expenditures  o trends affecting our future financial condition or results of operations  and o our business strategy regarding future operations 
any such forward looking statements are not assurances of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from anticipated results for a number of reasons  including o industry conditions  o future demand for new and used vehicles  o restrictions imposed on us by automobile manufacturers  o the ability to obtain the consents of automobile manufacturers to our acquisitions  o the availability of capital resources  and o the willingness of acquisition candidates to accept our common stock as currency 
the information contained in this annual report  including the information set forth below and under the heading business  identifies additional factors that could affect our operating results and performance 
we urge you to carefully consider those factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
dependence on acquisitions for growth growth in our revenues and earnings will depend significantly on our ability to acquire and successfully operate dealerships 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire dealerships in the future 
in addition  managing and integrating additional dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
restrictions by our manufacturers as well as covenants contained in our debt instruments limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships 
in addition  increased competition for acquisition candidates may develop  which could result in fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and or higher acquisition prices 
further  acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including possible diversion of resources and management s attention  inability to retain key acquired personnel and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will continue to need substantial capital in order to acquire additional automobile dealerships 
in the past  we have financed these acquisitions with a combination of cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities with banks and issuances of our common stock 
we cannot guarantee that these sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our acquisition program and other cash needs  or that we will be able to obtain adequate additional capital from other sources 
we expect to utilize our current credit facility to borrow a portion of the funds required for acquisitions 
if funds under the credit facility are insufficient to fund our acquisition program  we will be required to obtain alternative financing such as from the issuance of additional debt or equity securities or an expansion or replacement of the credit facility 
we currently intend to finance acquisitions by issuing shares of common stock as full or partial consideration for acquired dealerships 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to issue common stock for acquisitions will depend on the market value of the common stock from time to time and the willingness of potential acquisition candidates to accept common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses 
if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our common stock  we will be forced to rely solely on available cash or debt or equity financing  which could adversely affect our acquisition program 
accordingly  our ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected if our common stock is unfavorably valued by the market 
contingent acquisition payments in our early acquisitions in which we issued shares of our common stock as consideration  we guaranteed to the recipients of the shares that they would receive a minimum price for their shares if they sell the shares in the market 
in the event that they do not receive the guaranteed price in a sale  we will be required to pay them the difference between the price they receive and the guaranteed price 
as of december   there were approximately million shares of common stock subject to our guarantee with a weighted average guarantee price of approximately per share 
these guarantees have terms of three years to ten years with a weighted average term remaining of approximately years 
if we are required to perform on our guarantees  our liquidity and ability to finance our acquisition program could be adversely affected 
in addition  in certain of our acquisitions  we may be required to pay contingent consideration to the former stockholders of the acquired dealerships based on an increase in earnings before taxes of their operations during certain periods of time 
we cannot determine whether or how much we will have to pay in the future under these contingent payment arrangements 
if we are required to make any of these contingent payments  we will have to pay approximately one half of each payment in common stock and one half in cash 
if these contingent payments must be paid in full  our liquidity and ability to finance our acquisition program could be adversely affected 
dependence on the success of our manufacturers our success depends upon the overall success of the line of vehicles that each of our dealerships sells 
demand for our manufacturers vehicles as well as the financial condition  management  marketing  production and distribution capabilities of our manufacturers affect our business 
although we have attempted to lessen our dependence on any one manufacturer by buying dealerships representing a number of different domestic and foreign manufacturers  events such as labor disputes and other production disruptions that may adversely affect a manufacturer may also adversely affect us 
similarly  the late delivery of vehicles from manufacturers  which sometimes occurs during periods of new product introductions  can lead to reduced sales during those periods 
moreover  any event that causes adverse publicity involving any of our manufacturers may have an adverse effect on us regardless of whether such event involves any of our dealerships 
cyclicality our operations  like the automotive retailing industry in general  can be impacted by a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including consumer business cycles  consumer confidence  economic conditions  availability of consumer credit and interest rates 
although the above factors  among others  may impact our business  we believe the impact on our operations of future negative trends in such factors will be somewhat mitigated by our i strong parts  service and collision repair services  ii variable cost salary structure  iii geographic diversity and iv product diversity 
seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations  with the second and third quarters generally contributing more operating profit than the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is driven by three primary forces i manufacturer related factors  primarily the historical timing of major manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers  ii weather related factors and iii consumer buying patterns 
additional factors to consider our business is subject to factors in addition to those discussed above 
for a discussion of those factors  see business agreements with manufacturers  competition  governmental regulations and environmental matters 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rates through use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate  based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss
