item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we research and develop novel compounds for treating and diagnosing human diseases based on the discovery and understanding of the medical usefulness of genes 
we have used automated  high speed technology to discover the sequences of chemicals in genes and generate a large collection of partial human gene sequences 
we began our work in the genetics industry by identifying and cataloging genes 
we have since focused primarily on the research and development of proteins for the treatment of human disease 
we use our advanced computer system to identify the most promising product candidates 
we are able to analyze partial gene sequences  identify the genes corresponding to partial and full length gene sequences and the proteins made by those genes 
we recently expanded our use of anitbodies and other technologies to increase the opportunities created by our genomic database 
we have not received any product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and do not anticipate revenues from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years 
through december   we have received million in revenue and million in equity payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements with smithkline beecham  payments of million from additional collaboration partners and an aggregate of million from other collaborators  including million from transgene sa  million from pioneer hi bred international  inc  million from pharmacia upjohn company  million from schering plough in addition to certain payments received from schering plough pursuant to our additional collaboration partner agreements  million from f 
hoffmann la roche and million from oravax merieux co 
and merieux oravax snc pursuant to the terms of such collaboration agreements  we expect to receive license fees and research payments of million in the aggregate over the next two years 
see business collaborative arrangements 
we expect that our revenue sources for at least the next several years may be limited to interest income  payments under various collaboration agreements  payments from the sale of rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and increasing losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
earnings per share have been restated to reflect a two for one stock split paid in the form of a stock dividend on january  results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenue consisted of million in license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo  and merck  the recognition of million from the collaborations with transgene  sa and pharmacia  and million in other revenue 
the revenue consisted of million in annual license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo and merck  million in license fees and research payments from a collaboration with pioneer  the recognition of million from the collaboration with transgene sa  million in license fees from a collaboration with pharmacia  and million in other revenue 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the start of operations for our leased process development and manufacturing facility in  along with a continued increase in preclinical and clinical research 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins we discovered 
patent expenses will continue to increase as additional applications are filed and existing applications are prosecuted in the united states and internationally 
interest income was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances 
our average cash balance has increased during as a result of the placement of two convertible subordinated note offerings during  totaling million 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to these two convertible subordinated notes 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the difference in results for the years ended december  and is primarily due to higher operating expenses  reduced collaboration partner revenues  and lower net interest income 
years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenue consisted of million in annual license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo and merck  million in license fees and research payments from a collaboration with pioneer  the recognition of million from the collaboration with transgene sa  million in license fees from a collaboration with pharmacia and million in other revenue 
the revenue consisted of million in annual license fees and additional payments from collaborations with schering plough  sanofi synthelabo and merck  million in license fees and research payments from collaborations with pioneer and roche  and million in license fees from collaborations with pharmacia  medimmune and oravax 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the start of our clinical trials in  partially offset by a million reduction of payments under a research services agreement pursuant to the early termination of various agreements with the institute for genomic research 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  to support the increase in our activities 
the increase also resulted from significantly higher legal expenses associated with filing and prosecuting a larger number of patent applications relating to genes and proteins discovered by us 
interest income was higher for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher average cash balances 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the difference in results for the years ended december  and is primarily due to higher operating expenses  and the recognition of losses of million related to our investment in vascular genetics during the year ended december   offset by higher collaboration partner payments 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in working capital is due to the private placement of million in convertible subordinated notes during  partially offset by the net loss generated during the year 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which expenses are expected to increase relative to historical levels as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein product candidates 
at december   we had outstanding commitments for construction and equipment purchases totaling approximately million 
we expect that our existing funds  interest income  and committed license fees and research payments from our existing collaboration agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next several years 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs including our preclinical and clinical product development activities  the magnitude of those programs  the ability to establish collaborative and licensing arrangements  the cost involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and competing technological and market developments 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which expire  if unused  by the year we also had available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our funds are currently invested in us treasury and government agency obligations and high grade corporate debt securities and commercial paper 
these investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with the emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to become year  or yk  compliant 
because we were founded in  most if not all of our computer equipment and software adopt modern design principles 
we have not experienced any problems with the date rollover to the year with regard to our purchased computer systems  operating systems  or database management systems 
for internal systems development  we use four digit entries for all date items in our databases 
because these date representations have been built into systems from their inception  we have found them to be fully yk compliant 
we use third party equipment and software that has proved to be yk compliant 
to date  we are not aware of any major yk compliance problems impacting our business  however there can be no assurance that there will be no yk compliance disruptions in the coming months 
we do not believe that the cost of identification and correction of any yk compliance problems  estimated to be less than  will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
however  there can be no assurance that a failure of our internal computer systems  third party equipment  software we use  systems maintained by our suppliers  or utility systems such as electricity  gas  water  and telecommunications  to be yk compliant  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our corporate debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our us securities held as of december  is not material to our financial statements 
as of december   the carrying value of our equity investment in transgene was approximately million 
our investment in transgene is subject to equity market risk 
in february  we entered into an agreement with cambridge antibody technology to invest approximately million in exchange for  ordinary shares of cat 
we expect to close this transaction in april because we must make this investment in pounds sterling  we entered into a forward contract in order to eliminate any foreign currency risk associated with the purchase price 
our ongoing investment in cat will be denominated in pounds sterling and will be subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk
