creating manufacturing centers of excellence is expected to result in consolidated manufacturing operations in both europe and the us these actions are intended to eliminate redundancies and reduce fixed costs 
the company also plans to outsource and consolidate some of its distribution activities  which is expected to improve customer service  utilize space more efficiently  and reduce capital investment and operating costs 
the company s focus on its product offering and marketing efforts is expected to reduce operating costs  improve margins and inventory turns  and ultimately  provide the foundation for further sales growth of the company s graphics products business 
these actions will result in the elimination of more than positions  a few of which were eliminated during fiscal in addition to the restructuring charges of million recognized in fiscal  the company expects to spend approximately million  primarily in fiscal  for implementation costs 
these implementation costs will include employee retention bonuses  employee relocation expenses  employee outplacement expenses  equipment relocation expenses  and other related costs and will be expensed as they are incurred 
capital expenditures related to the restructuring plan are expected to total approximately million 
the expected pre tax cost savings to be generated from the restructuring plan are expected to be approximately million in fiscal and are expected to grow to million in fiscal and million per year thereafter 
although the company expects realization of such future cost savings  there can be no assurance that they will be achieved 
in april  the company initiated a new strategy for growth and restructuring the strategic plan designed to restore higher levels of sales growth and profitability and to reduce its cost structure 
the key initiatives of the strategic plan were focused on a significant reduction of the company s stock keeping units  rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities  and a major restructuring of its administrative and marketing and selling functions 
total restructuring charges recognized in fiscal  in connection with the strategic plan  were million pre tax per share 
this charge to restructuring included employee severance costs million  inventory writedowns and returns million  fixed and intangible asset writedowns million  recognition of future lease obligations million  and other related costs 
the company has substantially completed the implementation of its strategic plan

million pre tax 
per share some of its reserves established in connection with the company s implementation of its strategic plan 
this reserve reduction related primarily to a final resolution of lease obligations for a vacated facility and to lower than expected severance costs 
during fiscal  the company  on a net basis  reduced some of its restructuring reserves by million pre tax 
per share  a portion of which is included in cost of sales million pre tax 
this reserve reduction related primarily to lower than expected severance costs million  inventory returns million  decisions not to vacate certain leased facilities

the following discussion is on a continuing operations basis 
during fiscal  the company reduced by 
million pre tax 
per share some of its reserves established with respect to its business divestitures

during fiscal  the company reduced by 
million pre tax

this reserve reduction was principally related to lower than expected inventory returns 
in addition  the company reduced in fiscal by 
million pre tax 
per share some of the reserves established in connection with its disposal of the bevis discontinued business 
this reduction was largely attributable to lower than expected costs associated with accruals  primarily for accounts receivable and fixed assets  established at the time of the divestiture 
see the charts under comparison of fiscal vs 
below for information concerning the effects of the restructuring charges and reductions on reported operating results 
as a result of the above divestitures  including the discontinued bevis business  an aggregate of approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis and related profit will not be available to the company going forward 
management believes a critical part of the strategic plan and the restructuring plan is to offset these revenue and earnings losses through increased focus on the company s graphics products in the high growth digital imaging and sign and display markets  through leveraging the company s brand strength in consumer products  from internal new product development  and through acquisitions 
also  management believes improved manufacturing processes  rationalization of distribution facilities  and savings in administrative  marketing  and selling support areas will help offset these losses 
comparison of fiscal vs 
net sales 
net sales from continuing operations decreased 
to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this sales decrease was primarily the result of lower net selling prices  partially offset by higher unit volume  particularly from broader distribution in current sales channels  expanded placement of existing products  and introduction of new products

export sales of consumer products decreased in fiscal from fiscal  principally due to lower sales in latin america 
graphics products sales of million for fiscal decreased from fiscal sales of million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of laminating equipment products down  partially offset by higher sales of mounting and laminating supplies products up and board products up 
the decrease in laminating equipment product sales was due largely to significantly lower demand for high end equipment products and to continued softness in demand in asia and latin america 
export sales of graphics products decreased in fiscal from prior year 
foreign sales of graphics products decreased in fiscal from fiscal  due largely to lower sales of laminating equipment down and to decreases in the values of the british pound sterling and dutch guilder  partially offset by higher sales of mounting and laminating supplies products 
management is uncertain as to the extent that the unsettled conditions in asia and latin america will affect the company s business in the future 
in addition  the company is uncertain if the softness in demand for high end laminating equipment products will continue in the future 
as a result  management has begun focusing its efforts in the lower end of the laminating equipment market

european monetary union euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
the euro will trade on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  cash less payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
the company has assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
the company has also assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and for the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and has modified certain existing contracts 
the company s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
final accounting  tax  and governmental legal and regulatory guidance has been completed
