during the year ended december   the company performed it services for clients excluding clients that generated less than  in revenue during the year 
it services are primarily provided by the company through supplemental it services arrangements 
it solutions are provided through a combination of systems consulting  project outsourcing and supplemental it services arrangements 
substantially all services and solutions are billed on a time and materials basis 
for  the company estimates that supplemental it services accounted for more than while systems consulting and project outsourcing services accounted for less than of the company s revenue 
the company is seeking to increase its systems consulting and project outsourcing business to of revenue during the next months 
this goal is subject to a number of uncertainties and may not be achieved 
revenue growth is derived primarily from increases in the number of consultants placed with existing and new clients both through internal growth and through acquisitions 
the number of full time consultants grew from  at page december  to  at december  and to  at december  excluding the consultants gained through acquisitions  the number of full time consultants declined from  to  during over the same period  the company increased the average billing rates charged to clients for consultants 
since may  the company and the it services industry in general have experienced a slowdown in demand for it services 
this slowdown has mostly affected mainframe computer services 
management believes clients were reluctant to start new it projects until the full effect of computer problems associated with the advent of the year were known 
this reluctance has continued into the first quarter of the result has been to make it difficult for the company to place mainframe consultants on new assignments 
without new assignments  many mainframe consultants have left the company to seek other opportunities 
although demand for client server  network and internet related skills has been generally high  it has not been sufficient to offset the loss of mainframe consultants 
this reduction in demand has resulted in slower revenue growth in existing offices  lower bill rate increases and more non billable consultant time as compared to as a result  earnings fell during the third and fourth quarter of and are expected to fall in the first quarter of metro s revenue grew in to million  in to million and in to million 
in  and  the company s largest clients accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue and its largest client accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenue 
revenue growth during and was achieved almost entirely through internal growth  although and revenue growth includes revenue from two acquisitions in july  and one acquisition in december revenue growth in is attributable to acquisitions completed by the company between december and august without these acquisitions revenue would have increased approximately

in the offering  the company sold  shares and a shareholder of the company sold  shares 
shortly thereafter  the representatives of the several underwriters exercised their over allotment option resulting in the sale of  shares by other shareholders of the company 
the net proceeds to the company were approximately  the company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of page shares by the selling shareholders 
the company used a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering during and for the acquisitions of dp career associates  data systems technology  inc and the avery group  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company acquired dp specialists  inc and dp specialists learning center  llc  the professionals computer management consulting  inc  krystal solutions  inc  solution technologies  inc 
and acuity technology services  llc and acuity technology services of dallas  llc  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these acquisitions were financed with the balance of the proceeds from the company s january initial public offering  cash generated by operations and borrowings on the company s credit facilities 
the company made its first sale of stock under the metro information services  inc  employee stock purchase plan the espp on september  the company sold  shares for an aggregate purchase price of  during   shares for an aggregate purchase price of  during and  shares for an aggregate purchase price of  during the espp is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  certain employees exercised stock options which had vested pursuant to the employee incentive stock option plan 
total proceeds from the issuance of stock for option exercises during the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the company funds its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
net cash provided by operations was  for and consisted primarily of net income of  and  excluding the effects of acquisitions  an increase in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable are primarily due to the revenue growth experienced during to a lesser extent  accounts receivable increased because the companies acquired in do not collect their invoices as quickly as the rest of metro 
the company s working capital was  at december  compared to  at december  net cash used in investing activities was  for and included normal acquisitions of property and equipment used in operations of  and  of payments for the acquisitions described above 
the company s investing activities also include  spent on developing new computer systems for financial accounting  human resources and payroll activities 
see new systems implementation 
the funds used in these activities came from the company s lines of credit  cash generated by the company s operations  proceeds from the sale of stock and proceeds from the exercise of vested stock options and purchases of stock under the espp 
the company has experienced a slowdown in demand for its services since may this slowdown has reduced the rate of revenue growth for the company and caused earnings to fall 
cash flow from operations has been reduced as a result of the slowdown 
while the company expects this situation to change during the second quarter of  the short term effect of the slowdown is to increase the likelihood the company will have to borrow against its lines of credit to fund operations and future growth 
the company increased the maximum amount it may borrow on its credit facilities from  to  on january  and to  on august  amounts advanced under the facilities can be used for acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
the credit facilities are provided in equal amounts of  by three banks and  by a fourth bank 
as of december   the company had borrowed  against these facilities 
the facilities mature in june and may be extended each year for an additional year 
until june  interest  but no principal  is payable monthly 
two of the facilities allow the company to select among prime rate and london interbank offered rate libor based interest rates while the other two have only libor based interest rates 
all of the facilities have interest rates which increase as the balance outstanding under the facilities increases 
the rates on such borrowings ranged from to on december  the facilities also contain fees  ranging from to annually  which are charged on the unused portion of the facilities 
the facilities are collateralized by accounts receivable of the company 
page the credit facilities contain several covenants  including one requiring the maintenance of a certain tangible net worth ratio  which limit the amount of dividends that can be paid 
the covenants also impose limits on incurring other debt and require a certain debt service coverage ratio to be maintained 
the covenants may prevent the company from borrowing the full  of the facilities if adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization fall below  for any trailing four quarter period 
on march   the company negotiated more favorable terms on the credit facilities which are expected to allow the company to fully use the maximum borrowing amount 
the interest rates on the company s facilities change from time to time 
recent actions by the federal reserve to increase interest rates have increased the company s interest costs 
if the federal reserve increases rates further  the company s interest cost will increase as well 
assuming the company is in debt  and continues to have approximately  shares outstanding  a one percent increase in the interest rate will reduce annual earnings per share by approximately cents 
the company believes that the available funds under its credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet its needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next year 
these needs include the estimated earn out payment of approximately  included in accounts payable at december  and the estimated earnout payments payable by the company in on acquisitions completed in new acquisitions  however  are likely to require additional debt and equity financing 
seasonality metro s operating results are adversely affected when client facilities close due to holidays or inclement weather 
the company generally experiences a certain amount of seasonality in the fourth quarter due to the number of holidays and closings of client facilities during that quarter 
further  the company generally experiences lower operating results in the first quarter due in part to the timing of unemployment and fica tax accruals and delays in clients contract renewals related to clients budget approval processes 
inflation due to the high demand for it services and a shortage of qualified it consultants  wage inflation in the it services industry surpassed normal wage inflation during if this trend continues  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition if the company is unable to pass increased payroll costs on to its clients 
the company attempts to obtain bill rate increases from clients to offset these increases whenever possible 
the company expects to obtain bill rate increases in to offset pay rate increases in  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for average pay rates for increased over average pay rates for the company expects average pay rate increases in will fall between these percentages 
year issues the company has not experienced and management is not aware of clients who have experienced any material year problems 
new systems implementation on july   the company implemented new human resources  payroll and financial accounting software 
these systems provide enhanced capabilities and integration of information 
a combination of metro employees and outside consultants implemented these systems 
the company spent million on these systems 
the company capitalized these costs and is amortizing them over seven years 
page recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning june  the company does not expect sfas no 
to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the bulletin does not change existing rules on revenue recognition 
sab is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect sab to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed a new statement that would require all business combinations to be recorded using the purchase method of accounting and any resulting excess purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets would be charged to earnings over a period not to exceed years 
the proposal would also allow the reporting of earnings per share excluding amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
the proposed accounting would be effective for business combinations after the effective date 
the actual pronouncement  if issued  will likely have changes from the exposure draft 
if issued  this pronouncement would increase the amortization charge against earnings for any subsequent business combinations due to the year amortization period requirement 
the company has previously used a year life for goodwill 
as a result of these changes  the company believes investors may place increasing emphasis on net income before amortization of purchased intangible assets  net of tax effects  per share 
risk factors ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain consultants with the technical skills and experience required to meet its clients rapidly changing needs 
the company must continually identify and recruit technical personnel in each of its markets to fill new positions and to replace consultants who have left the company 
the it industry has high consultant turnover rates and the demand for consultants has  to date  substantially exceeded supply 
this has resulted in intense competition for consultants and the company expects such competition for consultants to increase in the future 
the company competes for these individuals with other providers of technical staffing services  system integrators  providers of outsourcing services  computer consultants  temporary personnel agencies and the company s own clients 
it professionals who work with the company also work with the company s competitors from time to time 
it professionals currently working on projects for the company may choose to work for competitors on future assignments 
the company s net revenues in any period are primarily driven by the number of it professionals the company has on billable assignments 
there can be no assurance that the company will attract and retain the personnel it requires to conduct its operations successfully or attract additional personnel for expanded operations 
failure to attract and retain such personnel or an increase in the company s consultant turnover rate could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change 
rapid technological advances  frequent product introductions and enhancements  and changes in client requirements characterize the market for it services 
the company s future success depends  in part  on its ability to provide consultants possessing the skills to service past  current and next generation products and technologies 
these factors will require the company to provide adequately trained personnel to address the increasing and evolving needs of its clients 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond rapidly to technological advances  new products and enhancements or changes in client requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the it services industry is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
although the market is consolidating  management believes no one company is dominant 
the company s competitors include general it page services firms  temporary staffing and personnel placement companies  general management consulting firms  major accounting firms  divisions of large hardware and software companies and niche providers of it services 
with the recent shift towards the internet a number of new competitors have entered the market 
these competitors are typically small but well funded services firms focused exclusively on helping businesses to change their relationships with customers and suppliers via the internet 
in addition  competition may come in the form of application service providers asps 
asps offer to host a standard or slightly customized versions of packaged software systems for businesses 
asps may attract clients who are dissatisfied with their custom software solutions or have difficulty managing their packaged software systems 
some of the company s competitors possess substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and a more established client base than the company 
in addition  the services offered by the company have been and continue to be provided by clients in house personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors as the industry continues to evolve 
risk associated with new services 
the company intends to grow  in part  through the development or acquisition of it services beyond the scope of services presently provided by the company 
the company s ability to successfully develop new services depends on a number of factors  including its ability to identify and effectively integrate new services into the company s existing operating structure 
the identification and offering of new services in which the company has no or little experience or expertise could result in diversion of management s attention and place disproportionate demands on the company s operational  administrative and financial resources 
there can be no assurance that the performance of any new service offerings  whether acquired or developed by the company  will meet management s expectations or provide the same profit margins as the company s existing operations 
contract performance and project outsourcing risks 
project outsourcing is distinguishable from the company s core business in that project outsourcing requires the company to assume a greater level of responsibility for developing or maintaining systems on behalf of its clients 
many of the company s project outsourcing engagements are critical to the operations of its clients businesses 
the company s failure or inability to complete such engagements to its clients satisfaction could have a material adverse effect on its clients operations and  consequently  may give rise to claims against the company for actual or consequential damages or otherwise damage its reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk associated with growth through acquisitions 
the company intends to grow  in part  through the acquisition of other it businesses 
the company s acquisition strategy depends on its ability to identify  finance and complete acquisitions 
there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities  which may increase the cost of acquisition candidates 
some competitors for these candidates have greater resources than the company 
the company will face a variety of additional risks if it completes acquisitions  including the inability to integrate the acquired businesses into the company s operations  the inability to achieve expected financial results from the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention  the inability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  losses due to liabilities and contingencies of the acquired businesses and the adverse impact on net income caused by amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the company s failure or inability to successfully implement and manage its acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the value of company stock held by shareholders at the time of any acquisition may be diluted if the company issues stock to complete any acquisition 
absence of long term contracts  dependence on key clients 
substantially all of the company s contracts to perform services may be canceled or modified by the company s clients at will without penalty 
approximately of the company s consultants are salaried employees and unless terminated  receive full compensation and benefits even if not engaged in billable work 
as a result  cancellation or reduction of a contract may result in a loss of revenue without a corresponding reduction in cost of revenue 
although the company has a broad client base  the loss of one or more large clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in  and  the company s largest clients accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue and its largest client accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenue 
page trend toward prime vendors 
to reduce the number of their it service providers  certain businesses are beginning to use a limited number of vendors and  in some cases  a single vendor collectively  prime vendors 
these prime vendors fill client needs directly or through subcontractors 
metro anticipates that this trend toward prime vendors may become increasingly common in the marketplace and may result in pricing pressure and the loss of business opportunities 
there can be no assurance that this trend will not lead to reduced gross profit margins and fewer opportunities to place consultants and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has taken steps  when practical  to become a prime vendor of it services 
in certain cases  the company experiences pricing pressure from clients as a condition to becoming or remaining a prime vendor 
in other cases  the company experiences demands to provide consultants in multiple locations to become or remain a prime vendor 
although the company believes it can effectively meet its clients requirements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with other prime vendors or remain a prime vendor 
risk associated with opening new offices 
the company recently accelerated its office expansion program by opening four new offices in  four new offices in and three new offices in in geographic markets where the company had no previous presence 
historically  for approximately six to months after opening  new offices have generally produced monthly operating losses or marginal operating income and have placed significant demands on the company s operational  administrative and financial resources 
in addition  the company s future performance and profitability will depend  in part  on its ability to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel to manage the growth and operations of the new offices 
the opening of additional offices  individually or in the aggregate  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
employment liability risks 
metro employs and places its consultants and other employees at its clients businesses 
risks associated with this activity include possible claims of discrimination and harassment  liabilities for errors and omissions by the company s employees  misuse of client proprietary information or intellectual property  injury to company and client employees  misappropriation of client funds  theft of client property  other criminal activity  torts and other similar claims 
in certain circumstances  the company may be held responsible for the actions of persons not under the company s direct control 
although the company has not had significant problems with respect to such employment liability  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such problems in the future 
reliance on technology and computer systems 
the company relies on its computer and communications systems  the hub of which is located at its corporate headquarters in virginia beach  virginia 
although the company has a disaster recovery plan  temporary or permanent loss of these systems from fire  power loss  natural disaster  operating malfunction or any other cause could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur 
dependence on senior management 
the continued growth and success of the company is largely dependent on the efforts  direction and guidance of its existing senior management and on its ability to attract and retain qualified managers 
the company has entered into employment agreements with its executive officers  each of which contains provisions limiting these employees rights to compete with the company and hire its employees 
the loss of any of the company s senior management or key personnel and  in particular  john h 
fain  president and chief executive officer  or andrew j 
downing  executive vice president and chief operating officer  or the inability to attract and retain key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company carries no key man life insurance on mr 
fain or mr 
downing 
intellectual property risks 
a portion of the company s business involves the development of software applications for specific client engagements 
although the company believes that its services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  it may be the subject of claims for infringement  which even if successfully page defended could be costly and time consuming 
an infringement claim against the company could materially and adversely affect the company in that the company may experience a diversion of the company s financial resources and the attention of management personnel  incur damages and litigation costs  including attorneys fees  be enjoined from future use of the intellectual property  be required to obtain a license to use the intellectual property  incurring licensing fees  need to develop a non infringing alternative  which could be costly and delay projects  and have to indemnify clients with respect to losses incurred as a result of the company s infringement of the intellectual property 
health plan self insurance risks 
the company self insures a portion of its group health and dental plan 
on december   approximately  of the company s  full time employees were covered by the group health plan 
the company self insures up to  of claims per covered employee per year with a company maximum annual aggregate liability of of expected claims as computed at the end of each year based on the number of covered persons during the year 
self insurance charges may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter and may cause a material adverse effect on the company s quarterly and annual business  operating results and financial condition
