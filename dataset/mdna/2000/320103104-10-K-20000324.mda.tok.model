assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amount required to meet estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors management may consider are the quality of specific loans  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  the level of non accruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and charge offs and collateral values of the underlying security 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses 
ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current estimates 
losses on loans  including impaired loans  are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of principal is doubtful 
provisions for loan losses totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
provisions result from management s continuing internal review of the loan portfolio as well as its judgment as to the adequacy of the reserves in light of the condition of the regional real estate market and the economy generally 
as a result of increased loans  there is an expectation that the bank will continue to find it necessary to make provisions for loan losses in the future

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccruing and restructured loans including impaired loans  and foreclosed property 
nonperforming assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the bank s general practice is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans including impaired loans for which payment of interest or principal is ninety days or more past due or for such other loans as considered necessary by management if collection of interest and principal is doubtful 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against current period interest income 
the recorded investment of restructured loans was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the amount of interest that would have been earned had the nonaccrual and restructured loans performed in accordance with original terms and conditions was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreclosed property at december  totaled  compared to  at december  and consists mainly of real estate collateral from loans that were foreclosed  as well as repossessed automobiles

the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to operations 
the potential for loss in the portfolio reflects the risks and uncertainties inherent in the extension of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s assessment of risk elements in the portfolio  factors affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economic environment in which the company operates 
the process includes identification and analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of significant individual problem credits 
in addition  management reviews overall portfolio quality through an analysis of current levels and trends in charge off  delinquency and nonaccruing loan data  forecasted economic conditions and the overall banking environment 
these reviews are of necessity dependent upon estimates  appraisals and judgments  which may change quickly because of changing economic conditions and the company s perception as to how these factors may affect the financial condition of debtors 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a review of the following key elements a formula allowance for the various loan portfolio classifications  a valuation allowance for loans identified as impaired  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula allowance is a percentage based reflection of historical loss experience and assigns required allowance allocations by loan classification based on a fixed percentage of all outstanding loan balances and commitments to extend credit 
the formula allowance employs a risk rating model that grades loans based on general characteristics of credit quality and relative risk 
as credit quality becomes more suspect  so called watch list loans  the risk rating and allocation percentage increase 
the sum of these allocations comprise the company s formula or general allowance 
the company also has valuation allowances for impaired loans 
loans are evaluated for impairment by measuring the net present value of the expected future cash flows using the loan s original effective interest rate  or looking at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the difference between the net present value of a loan or fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent is lower than the recorded investment of the loan  the difference is provided to expense with a resulting valuation allowance 
in addition to the formula and valuation components  there is an unallocated allowance that is composed of two additional elements 
the first element  which is based on the company s credit policy  consists of an amount that is at least to of the formula and valuation allowances 
this element recognizes the estimation risks associated with the formula model and the valuation allowance 
the second element is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining the formula and valuation allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss resulting from these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated allowance include the following then existing general economic and business conditions affecting the company s key lending areas  credit quality trends  including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results  and findings of our internal credit examiners 
when an evaluation of these conditions signifies a change in the level of risk  the company adjusts the formula allowance 
periodic credit reviews enable further adjustment to the allowance through the risk rating of loans and identification of loans requiring a valuation allowance 
in addition  the formula model is designed to be self correcting by taking into account recent loss experience 
the annual provision for loan losses is set based on the factors discussed above 
in addition  it is management s intent to maintain the allowance at a level consistent with the company s peers in the banking industry 
the allowance to loans ratio of at december  was slightly below the company s peer group s average allowance ratio of although the company realized total loan growth of million or during  there were no significant changes in loan concentrations  loan quality or loan terms during the period 
estimation methods and assumptions affecting the allowance for loan losses remained unchanged from those used in prior periods 
there was no significant reallocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various segments of the portfolio

during the second quarter of  the company reclassified to available for sale all securities previously classified as held to maturity 
this reclassification was the result of an analysis of the strategic alternatives for the securities portfolio 
under securities and exchange commission guidelines  this reclassification prohibits the company from classifying securities as held to maturity for a period of at least two years
