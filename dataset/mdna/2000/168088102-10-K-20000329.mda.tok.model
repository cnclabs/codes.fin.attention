results of operations in most respects  was another very good year for chicago rivet machine co 
the most important achievements include increases in revenue from both the fastener and assembly equipment segments of our business and a corresponding increase in net income 
other positives for the year include the absence of any year yk issues as a result of the significant progress toward full implementation of new information management technology and significant investments in equipment that will enhance and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
our financial condition remains solid  and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that will accompany the new year 
compared to the company s net sales and lease revenues increased approximately  totaling  in  compared with  recorded in revenues within the fastener segment improved  reflecting the strength of the automotive industry  which represents the company s largest market 
while revenue from sales within the assembly equipment segment improved  lease revenues in that segment declined compared to the prior year  which resulted in a net increase in sales and lease revenues within the assembly equipment segment of 
overall  gross margins improved to  an increase of approximately  despite a charge of  associated with a product recall 
selling and administrative expenses increased significantly  primarily due to expenditures for information technology  and net income increased to  the fastener segment produced the most dramatic changes compared with revenues within this segment increased to  this increase was largely a reflection of very strong growth in the economy in general and record levels of production within the automotive industry 
the increased volume levels contributed to generally higher margins as fixed costs  with the exception of depreciation  remained relatively constant compared with the strength of the employment market contributed to increases in wage levels that slightly exceeded overall inflation level  and the limited availability of skilled labor necessitated an increase in overtime expense in order to meet increased demand within this segment of our operations 
despite the strong market conditions prevalent throughout the year  our markets remain extremely price competitive  and our ability to obtain price relief continued to be limited 
fortunately  efforts to control manufacturing costs in other areas continued to be successful  and the company also benefited from negotiated reductions in the costs of certain raw materials 
while the fundamental performance within this segment of our business was very successful  that success was tarnished by a charge incurred in connection with a recall of vehicles that contained certain non conforming parts which were manufactured by the company 
as previously reported  a settlement was successfully negotiated  but total costs incurred in connection with this incident amounted to  before taxes  of which  was charged to cost of goods sold  offsetting a portion of the positive improvements recognized in operations 
revenues within the assembly equipment segment  as a whole  also improved compared with however  competitive conditions caused the company to occasionally accept margins below those that were enjoyed in the past  and  as a result  the increase in revenues was slightly biased toward products with lower margins 
in addition  increases in costs of raw materials and other manufacturing expenses nearly offset the increase in revenues 
as a result  the margin increase within this segment was minimal 
selling and administrative expenses increased slightly over compared with the prior year 
costs incurred in connection with implementation of new data processing systems  including efforts related to mitigating the impact of any potential yk issues  amounted to nearly  during the year and represent the primary factor contributing to the increased level of selling and administrative expense 
increases in data communications expense and depreciation related to the new information system added an additional  to administrative expenses 
freight and shipping expenses  associated with increased activity levels were higher by approximately  and profit sharing expense increased by  bad debt expense was reduced by  and travel expense declined by  increases in salary expenses were partially offset by a reduction in commission expense as a larger percentage of sales was handled by company employees 
interest expense during decreased approximately  compared with as the effect of higher interest rates was offset by a lower outstanding balance on the loan 
interest income was approximately  lower than that recorded in the prior year due to a reduction in the level of funds available for investment in interest bearing accounts 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
during interim periods  the company uses estimated gross profit rates to determine the cost of goods sold 
actual results can vary from these estimates and these estimates are adjusted  as necessary  when actual information is available 
during the fourth quarter of  net income included net favorable adjustments to inventory  accruals and allowances aggregating 
per share 
similar adjustments in the fourth quarter of and amounted to 
per share and 
per share  respectively 
compared to net sales and lease revenues increased slightly compared with  totaling  for  compared with  recorded during revenues in the fastener segment increased  largely as a result of the robust conditions in the automotive industry  which is the company s primary market 
conversely  revenues from the assembly equipment segment  which includes sale of automatic assembly equipment  related tools and parts and lease revenue  declined compared to several factors contributed to the decline in revenue within the assembly equipment segment 
the primary factor was a decline in unit volume compared to  which was an uncharacteristically strong year 
also evident in was a noticeable change in product mix  with sales consisting of more lower priced equipment compared to finally  in order to maintain certain customer relationships  the company responded to competitive pricing pressures by accepting margins below those historically associated with its products in this segment 
the positive impact from the increased level of fastener business was largely offset by increases in wages  higher costs related to health insurance and additional tooling expense in connection with initial production of a variety of new fasteners 
in addition  depreciation expense increased compared to due to increased capital expenditures 
competitive conditions within the fastener industry  in conjunction with our major customers continuing policy of not accepting price increases  restricted our ability to increase prices sufficiently to recover these higher costs 
the net result is reflected in only nominal improvement in gross profit within this segment of our operations 
the company s investment in newer  more efficient equipment and procedures is intended to reduce costs as well as expand capabilities  and should lead to improved operating margins in the future 
as would be expected given the s lower volume  gross profits in the assembly equipment segment declined compared to while variable costs were reduced in proportion to the reduced level of operations  fixed costs increased slightly due primarily to higher wage and depreciation expense 
finally  the competitive situation discussed above also had an adverse impact upon margins within this segment 
selling and administrative expenses  net of certain favorable adjustments to environmental reserve accounts  increased compared to three factors comprised the majority of this increase 
first  expenses incurred in connection with the development and implementation of new data processing software amounted to approximately  second  bad debt expense increased by  due to the voluntary reorganization of a certain fastener customer  and third  the company incurred certain state taxes  totaling  during while the company was subject to this same state tax in  no tax liability was incurred in that year due to certain deductions allowed in the computation of the tax 
in addition  the company incurred higher selling expense as a result of increased staffing designed to strengthen our presence in certain key markets 
a portion of these increased costs were offset by reductions in commission expense  reductions in expenses related to attaining qs certification and a reduction in profit sharing expense 
non operating expense declined approximately compared with  primarily as a result of reduced interest expense  which decreased from  in to  during this interest expense is related to borrowing in connection with the acquisition of h l tool company  inc the decrease in interest expense reflects both lower interest rates in and a lower principal balance outstanding compared with interest income increase approximately compared with due primarily to higher level of investment during the year 
dividends the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of 
per share during in addition  an extra dividend of 
per share was paid during the second quarter of  bringing the total dividend payout to per share 
on february  your board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable march  to shareholders of record march  this continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the company to its shareholders that extends over years 
at that same meeting  the board declared an extra dividend of 
per share  payable april  to shareholders of record  april  machinery equipment investments in machinery and equipment totaled  during once again  investments in new equipment related to the manufacture of fasteners accounted for the majority of these investments and amounted to  during the year 
investments in hardware and software related to improved information management technology totaled  a total of  was expended for the purchase of a variety of test and inspection equipment related to quality control initiatives 
investments in new machine tools used in the manufacture of assembly equipment totaled  approximately  was invested in new telephone equipment and the balance was expended for the purchase  or repair  of various  smaller machine tools and building repairs 
the company made a number of significant investments in both equipment and building improvements during capital expenditures totaled nearly  expenditures related to new data processing systems  including computer hardware and software  amounted to approximately  expenditures for the purchase of new equipment used in the manufacture of fasteners amounted to  the company also purchased a variety of new machine tools  material handling equipment and inspection equipment valued at approximately  building improvements  which included the installation of new air compressors at one facility and a new roof at another facility  amounted to approximately  investment in both new equipment and rebuilding of existing equipment used to plate and heat treat fasteners amounted to  a total of  was expended for the construction of new automatic rivet setting equipment that is leased to customers 
the balance was expended for a variety of smaller office equipment and for the construction of new rivet setting machines that will be used for demonstration purposes 
during  capital investments totaled  significant expenditures included approximately  for equipment used in the manufacture of fasteners and assembly equipment   for data processing and telecommunications equipment  building improvements amounting to  and approximately  which was invested in new equipment related to quality control 
the balance consists of investments in material handling equipment and other miscellaneous equipment 
depreciation expense amounted to  in   in and  in liquidity and capital resources despite the significant capital investments described above  the company s working capital increased slightly during the year and amounted to approximately million at the end of accounts receivable balances increased somewhat compared to the prior year 
this change reflects an increase in the number of customers delaying payment beyond the agreed upon terms and does not represent a deterioration in the quality of these receivables 
increases in inventory balances are expected to be temporary as they reflect increased stock levels as a hedge against potential yk disruptions and an additional increase in stock levels as a safeguard against potential  but unexpected  disruptions related to migration to new information management technology 
long term debt was reduced by million as the company continued to meet the repayment obligations of a commercial loan obtained in connection with the acquisition of h l tool company  inc the company borrowed million  on an unsecured basis  subject to certain customary covenants 
under the terms of the note  the company is scheduled to repay the principal in quarterly installments of  plus interest computed on the unpaid balance at a variable rate that is calculated under one of two methods the london inter bank offering rate  plus basis points  or the lender s reference rate  less basis points 
this rate is adjusted quarterly 
at year end  the rate was approximately and the unpaid balance of the note was million 
in march   the company initiated a tender offer for up to  shares of its outstanding common stock at a price between and per share 
details of the offer were previously distributed to shareholders 
in order to fund this purchase  the company has obtained a financing commitment for a term loan of up to million 
this new borrowing will replace the existing loan described above 
the amount of the new borrowing will depend upon the amount and price of shares tendered  and will be equal to the purchase cost of tendered shares combined with the balance then outstanding under the existing business loan 
under terms of the new commitment  principal payments are scheduled to be made in quarterly installments of  together with interest computed on the unpaid balance under one of two methods the london inter bank offering rate  plus to basis points  the specific rate to be determined quarterly based upon certain financial ratios  or the lender s reference rate  less to basis points  determined quarterly depending upon certain financial ratios 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million during management believes that this level of investment can be funded internally  nevertheless  a million line of credit  which was obtained from bank of america in connection with the acquisition  remains available to the company 
there was no charge for this facility  which remained unused as of december  the facility is scheduled to expire on may   but may be extended beyond that date 
new accounting standards the company s financial statements and financial condition were not  and are not expected to be  materially impacted by any other new  or proposed  accounting standards 
stock purchase program terms of a stock repurchase authorization originally approved by the board of directors in february of  and subsequently amended to permit the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares  provide for purchases to be made from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions  at prices deemed reasonable by management 
purchases under the current repurchase authorization have amounted to  shares at an average price of per share 
this includes the purchase of  shares during at an average price of per share 
it is management s intention to continue this program  provided market conditions are favorable and funding for repurchases is available 
year compliance we are pleased to report that no significant yk disruptions were incurred by the company  its major customers or its suppliers 
as previously reported  the company s primary approach to preventing anticipated yk issues was directly related to its efforts to install a new information management technology 
while the investment in new technology provided a solution to potential yk issues  it should also yield significant improvements in day to day operations 
it is not possible to separate the costs of this effort into segments solely related to yk issues and those associated with the other benefits of this project 
the total expenditures related to information technology and other specific yk related costs amounted to approximately million through the end of outlook for the coming year will bring new opportunities  along with new challenges 
the company has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to meet the challenges that face manufacturing concerns 
with the cooperation of our employees and our valued suppliers  we have managed to maintain profitability in the face of generally rising manufacturing costs in a market that has become increasingly competitive and increasingly resistant to normal efforts to pass on increased costs of doing business 
while we have been successful in the past  we recognize that future success will require continued emphasis on cost control as well as new initiatives 
our recent investments in manufacturing equipment and in information technology have positioned the company to take advantage of opportunities as they arise and are expected to contribute toward maintaining profitability and increasing market share 
however  costs continue to increase  most notably wages and benefits  especially health insurance costs which are expected to increase more than  in the coming year 
energy costs have also increased recently  and it is too early to determine if increases in the price of oil will manifest themselves in higher costs for other materials and supplies 
given the administration s efforts to slow the economy  the recent increase in oil prices and the uncertainties associated with an election year  forecasting economic activity for the coming year is extremely difficult 
through the first two months of  incoming orders have been somewhat softer than those enjoyed in the same period in the two prior years  suggesting  perhaps  that revenues in the coming year will not equal the record levels recorded in nevertheless  we believe the company is well positioned to meet the challenges that lie ahead and  more importantly  to take advantage of the opportunities the future will bring 
we wish to express our appreciation to our employees  our customers and our suppliers for their contributions to the company s success and we gratefully acknowledge the continued loyalty and support of our shareholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk over time  the company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the company has not historically used derivative financial instruments 
as of december   million of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates compared to million at the prior year end 
this exposure was primarily linked to the london interbank offering rate and the lender s reference rate under the company s term loan 
a hypothetical change in these rates would not have had a material effect on the company s annual earnings
