results of operations although we were formed prior to january   we did not complete our initial public offering ipo until february   at which time we purchased our initial properties and began generating rental income 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio and the timing of our property acquisitions properties owned as of december  versus properties as of december   from which we generate our rental income 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we began  on a prospective basis  straight lining our rents for leases with fixed minimum escalators 
this increased rental revenue for the year ended december  by approximately  the effect on prior years was not material 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for interest and other income during the year ended december  was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of the net proceeds of a private placement offering and our ipo including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option both of which were completed during the first quarter of 
these net proceeds were fully used during and therefore did not generate interest income during interest and other income during was primarily generated from the investment of the excess of debt issuance proceeds over the amount invested in properties and a  gain on the sale of properties during depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
partially offsetting the increase was a change in the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were acquired prior to that were being depreciated over years 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed the age and estimated remaining useful life of each of our properties in our real estate portfolio that we acquired prior to based on the average age of these assets  we changed the depreciable life on the majority of our buildings and improvements that were currently being depreciated over a year life to a year life in order to properly reflect the estimated remaining useful lives 
the change in depreciable life is consi dered a change in an accounting estimate and has been recorded on a prospective basis beginning in the third quarter of the impact of this change decreased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase is primarily due to increased payroll and related benefits attributable to personnel additions throughout and severance payments made in connection with staffing reductions during the first quarter of also contributing to the increase were increased marketing expenses as well as increased professional fees and other administrative costs associated with increased public reporting requirements 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction in payroll and related expenses as a result of staffing reductions throughout and the closing of the chicago office during the second quarter of interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to interest charged on issued debt in late and throughout including mortgage debt and borrowings under our credit facility 
debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness compared to million all of which was fixed rate indebtedness as of december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december  and were attributable to operating  investing and financing activities  as described below

final terms and conditions are currently being negotiated 
we also have had discussions with several financial institutions to obtain additional unsecured  partially secured or secured loans or credit facilities  the amount and terms of which have not been determined 
liquidity requirements 
short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses  regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  recurring capital expenditures  distributions to shareholders and unitholders  and amounts required for additional property acquisitions 
we expect to meet these requirements other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions through cash flow provided by operating activities 
we anticipate that any additional acquisition of properties during the next months will be funded with amounts available under our existing and committed secured credit facilities  and with future secured and unsecured debt 
acquisitions will be made subject to our investment objectives and policies to maximize both current income and long term growth in income 
as of december   long term liquidity requirements consisted primarily of maturities under our long term debt 
we anticipate that long term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for acquisition of properties 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and other debt and equity financing alternatives 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions 
our liquidity requirements with respect to future acquisitions may be reduced to the extent that we use units as consideration for such purchases

year update in  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to confront year issues 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of our software applications and hardware systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no material information technology or non information technology systems problems  and we believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we did not occur significant costs in designing and implementing our year plan  nor did we incur significant costs in modifying our existing software applications  replacing hardware or hiring consultants in resolving year issues 
in addition  we are not aware that any of our tenants or third parties with whom we conduct business experienced any material systems problems related to year issues 
we will continue to monitor our information technology and non information technology systems and those of our tenants and third parties with whom we conduct business throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
although management does not anticipate any additional expenditures relating to year issues  there can be no assurance as to the magnitude of any future costs until significant time has passed 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined under the revised definition adopted in by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring or sales of property plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
we consider ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of our presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
ffo of the operating partnership for the years ended december  and is computed as follows in thousands net income before minority interest   real estate depreciation and amortization   straight line rental income gain on sale of asset funds from operations   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
as of december   we had fixed rate indebtedness totaling approximately million 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percent higher  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations will affect our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt 
as of december   we had variable rate indebtedness totaling approximately million 
if the interest rate on our variable rate debt instrument outstanding at december  had been one percent higher  our annual interest expense relating to that debt instrument would have increased by  based on balances at december
