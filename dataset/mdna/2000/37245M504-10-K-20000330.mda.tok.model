item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery  research and development 
genta has been unprofitable to date and  even if it obtains financing to continue its operations  expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing research and development activities  preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities  and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from the period since its inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and it expects that these fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses will continue  although mitigated by recent developments 
the company has been reducing its human and other resources to reduce expenses while focusing its research and development r d efforts 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio  primarily  but not exclusively  focused on its anticode tm antisense products 
to this end  the company has significantly reduced its involvement with respect to its investment in an r d joint venture  genta jago  through an interim agreement reached in march the company also entered into an asset purchase agreement on march  for the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the company s wholly owned specialty chemicals subsidiary jbl scientific  inc jbl for cash  a promissory note and certain pharmaceutical development services in support of genta s g development project 
the transaction was completed on may  following the sale of jbl  the company is operating as one business segment 
accordingly  the following information and accompanying financial statements reflect jbl as a discontinued operation 
the company has closed its operation in france 
the company has also closed its facilities in san diego  california and has moved its headquarters to lexington  massachusetts as of the second quarter of in august  the company acquired androgenics technologies  inc  a wholly owned entity of the company s majority stockholder 
androgenics is a company with license rights to a series of compounds invented at the university of maryland  baltimore to treat prostate cancer 
as consideration for the acquisition  the company paid  in cash including reimbursements of pre closing expenses and on going research funding and issued warrants with exercise prices ranging from to per share to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  of which will not become exercisable until the successful conclusion of certain development milestones  ranging from the initial clinical patient trial through the submission of an application for marketing authorization 
the company has recently completed a private placement for million  however  its ability to continue operations beyond the first quarter of depends upon the company s success in obtaining additional funding 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funds on satisfactory terms or at all 
there are several factors that must be considered risks in that regard and those that are known to management are discussed in md a certain trends and uncertainties 
the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding the expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the company intends that all forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements reflect the company s views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many risks and uncertainties  which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
examples of such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  obtaining sufficient financing to maintain the company s planned operations  the timely development  receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and acceptance of new products  the successful application of the company s technology to produce new products  the obtaining of proprietary protection for any such technology and products  the impact of competitive products and pricing and reimbursement policies  changing market conditions and the other risks detailed in the certain trends and uncertainties section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statements 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations relates to the company s continuing business 
operating revenues totaled million in compared to million in and zero in the changes in operating revenue have largely reflected the company s lessened involvement in genta jago development activities 
related party contract revenues decreased from  in  to  in and zero in it is anticipated that  as the company has reduced its resources and focused them on its development of its lead anticode tm oligonucleotide  g  this trend will continue 
it should be noted that at the same time  the company has reduced its commitment to provide funds to genta jago 
on march   genta and skyepharma on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement pursuant to which the parties to the joint venture released each other from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations of genta jago 
skyepharma agreed to be responsible for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties and for the further development of the joint venture s products  with any net income resulting therefrom to be allocated in agreed upon percentages between genta and skyepharma as set forth in such interim agreement 
the completion of the sale of the assets of jbl resulted in a significant decrease in ongoing revenues  as all of the company s historical product sales have been attributable to jbl 
collaborative research and development revenues were  annually in and and zero in  recognized pursuant to the company s collaboration with johnson johnson consumer products  inc see business anticode tm brand of antisense oligonucleotide programs  oligonucleotide collaborative and licensing agreements and other anticode agreements 
the above agreement has expired 
costs and expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in primarily  the overall decrease between and reflects reduced research and development and general and administrative charges offset by non recurring charges related to restructuring 
the decrease in r d expenses is the result of work force reductions and related closure of research and development facilities in san diego 
the increase from to reflects increases in clinical trials and related drug supply  salaries and non cash stock compensation charges 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
all preclinical biology and clinical trial work are now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for preclinical studies  clinical trials  the g anticode oligonucleotide program and increased regulatory costs 
the company will be required to assess the potential costs and benefits of developing its own anticode tm oligonucleotide manufacturing  marketing and sales activities if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing  as compared to establishing a corporate partner relationship 
research and development expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease in research and development expenses between and is primarily attributable to the company s re deployment of certain employees  and related workforce reductions implemented in together with the discontinuation of several programs 
research and development and certain other services the company provided to genta jago under the terms of the joint venture were significantly reduced over the period from through these amounts were  in   in and zero in the increase between and is due primarily to expanded clinical trials and non cash stock compensation charges of  it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future  assuming the company obtains sufficient financing  as the development program for g expands and more patients are treated in clinical trials at higher doses  through longer or more treatment cycles  or both 
furthermore  the company is pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates  which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trials will proceed in this manner or that the company will initiate new development programs 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the million decrease from to reflects reductions in staff and in accounting and legal expenses 
legal expenses were higher in due to several factors successfully defending the litigation brought by certain of the company s preferred stockholders challenging a million investment made in february  which litigation was resolved in the company s favor in april  and the company s successful efforts to avoid a potential nasdaq delisting associated with the equity offerings consummated in the increase from to reflects primarily non cash stock compensation charges of  and accrual for severance due to change in management 
see legal proceedings and market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities 
as a continuation of its restructuring plan  in may  genta again reassessed its personnel requirements and established another termination plan involving the termination of research and administrative employees 
the company recorded general and administrative expenses of  in the second quarter of for accrued severance costs 
in  three additional staff personnel left the company  and two senior managers joined the company 
another senior manager joined the company in although the company has reduced its work force to a core group of corporate personnel  the remaining team is able to maintain genta s operations in the development of g the company recorded charges to general and administrative expenses of   and  in  and  respectively  to account for the carrying value of abandoned patents no longer related to the research and development efforts of the company 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to identify a material impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company continues to evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications  particularly as expenses to prosecute or maintain these patents come due 
through this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain these patents  seek to out license them  or abandon them 
the company s equity in net loss of its joint venture genta jago totaled million in  compared to million in and a net gain of million in the decrease in the company s equity in net loss of its joint venture during relative to is largely attributable to the fact that development efforts became focused exclusively on geomatrix based products and a greater portion of development activities were funded pursuant to genta jago s collaborative agreements with third parties 
the operating results of genta jago are based primarily on three factors 
first  genta jago receives collaborative research and development revenue from third parties 
secondly  genta jago is billed by jagotec and genta for research and development costs associated with genta jago projects 
thirdly  there are general and administrative costs associated with the joint venture 
the increase in equity in net income of joint venture from to is due to an agreement signed on march   between the company and skyepharma on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement the interim jv agreement pursuant to which the company was released from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations of genta jago  the joint venture between the company and skyepharma 
skyepharma agreed to be responsible for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties and for the further development of the joint venture s products  with any net income resulting therefrom to be allocated in agreed upon percentages between the company and skyepharma 
as a result of the interim jv agreement  the company wrote off its liability relative to the company s recorded deficit in the joint venture and  as such  recorded a gain of approximately million for the three months ended march  also  according to revised revenue sharing agreements  the company reported approximately  for its proportionate share of net income of genta jago in relation to skyepharma s royalty agreement  with elan pharmaceuticals  for genta jago s product  naproxen 
interest income has fluctuated significantly each year and is anticipated to continue to fluctuate primarily due to changes in the levels of cash  investments and interest rates during each period 
interest expense was million in   in and in in consideration of a beneficial conversion feature on a debt instrument  the company recorded  in imputed interest on million in convertible debentures due august   that were originally issued in september and were converted at a discount to market 
the discount represents an effective interest rate of 
the company recorded a million charge to imputed interest in related to value associated with million bridge warrants issued in connection with a million debt issue in february in consideration of a beneficial conversion feature on a convertible equity security  the company recorded  in imputed dividends for discounted conversion terms and liquidation preference of the series d preferred stock issued in the private placement 
recent accounting pronouncements on june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure instruments at fair value 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement and does not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from private and public offerings of its equity securities 
cash provided from these offerings totaled approximately million through december   including net proceeds of million raised in and million raised during at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million compared to million at december  management believes that at the current rate of spending  the company will have sufficient cash funds to maintain its present operations through december  the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
to the extent that the company is successful in accelerating its development of g or in expanding its development portfolio or acquiring or adding new development candidates  the current cash resources would be consumed at a greater rate 
certain parties with whom the company has agreements have claimed default and  should the company be obligated to pay these claims or should the company engage legal services to defend or negotiate its positions or both  its ability to continue operations could be significantly reduced or shortened 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties claims of genta s default under various agreements 
the company anticipates that significant additional sources of financing  including equity financing  will be required in order for the company to continue its planned operations 
the company also anticipates seeking additional product development opportunities from external sources 
such acquisitions may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
the company s working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of the company s research and development programs  ii the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that the company devotes to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties our business will suffer if we fail to obtain timely funding 
if the company successfully secures sufficient levels of collaborative revenues and other sources of financing  it expects to use such financing to continue to expand its ongoing research and development activities  preclinical testing and clinical trials  costs associated with the market introduction of potential products  and expansion of its administrative activities 
as previously discussed in the md a overview  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with promega corporation on march  under the agreement  a wholly owned subsidiary of promega acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of jbl for million in cash  a million promissory note  and pharmaceutical development services to be provided to genta

in  the company discontinued its effort to develop a capability at jbl to manufacture oligonucleotides and wrote off  to research and development expense 
in october  jbl retained a chemical consulting firm to advise it with respect to an incident of soil and groundwater contamination 
sampling conducted at the jbl facility revealed the presence of chloroform and perchloroethylenes pces in the soil and groundwater at this site 
a semi annual groundwater monitoring program is being conducted  under the supervision of the california regional water quality control board  for purposes of determining whether the levels of chloroform and pces have decreased over time 
the results of the latest sampling conducted by jbl show that pces and chloroform have decreased in all but one of the monitoring sites 
based on an estimate provided to the company by the consulting firm  the company accrued  in  relating to remedial costs 
prior to  such costs were not estimable  and therefore  no loss provisions had been recorded

from november through december   each share of series a preferred stock was convertible into shares of common stock 
at december  each share of series a preferred stock was convertible into shares of common stock 
terms of the company s series a preferred stock require the payment of dividends annually in amounts ranging from per share per annum for the first year to per share per annum in the third and fourth years 
dividends were to be paid in cash or common stock or a combination thereof  at the company s option 
dividends on the series a preferred stock accrued on a daily basis whether or not declared and accumulated to the extent not paid on the annual dividend payment date following the dividend period for which they accrued 
the company may redeem the series a preferred stock under certain circumstances  and was required to redeem the series a preferred stock  subject to certain conditions  in september at a redemption price of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends the redemption price 
the company elected to pay the redemption price in common stock in order to conserve cash and was required under the terms of the series a preferred stock to use its best efforts to arrange for a firm commitment underwriting for the resale of such common stock which would allow the holders ultimately to receive cash instead of securities for their series a preferred stock 
despite using its best efforts  the company was unable to arrange for a firm commitment underwriting

as a result of the modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the company experienced no significant operational problems for its computer systems related to the year date change 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer application and those of its suppliers throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
certain trends and uncertainties in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully 
our business will suffer if we fail to obtain timely funding 
our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our available resources  including the proceeds from our recent private offering  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs into the first quarter our future capital requirements will depend on the results of our research and development activities  preclinical studies and bioequivalence and clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  and regulatory processes of the fda and other regulatory authority 
if our operations do not become profitable before we exhaust existing resources  we will need to raise substantial additional financing in order to continue our operations 
we may seek additional financing through public and private resources  including debt or equity financing  or through collaborative or other arrangements with research institutions and corporate partners 
we may not be able to obtain adequate funds for our operations from these sources when needed or on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity  or securities convertible into equity  the ownership interest of existing genta stockholders will be subject to further dilution and share prices may decline 
if we are unable to raise additional financing  we will need to do the following delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  license third parties to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves  sell genta to a third party  to cease operations  or declare bankruptcy 
our products are in an early stage of development 
most of our resources have been dedicated to applying molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to the research and development of potential anticode tm pharmaceutical products based upon oligonucleotide technology 
while we have demonstrated the activity of anticode tm oligonucleotide technology in model systems in vitro in animals  only one of these potential anticode tm oligonucleotide products  g  has begun to be tested in humans 
results obtained in preclinical studies or early clinical investigations are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained in extended human clinical trials 
our products may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics that may prevent our obtaining fda or foreign regulatory approval for any indication 
in addition  it is possible that research and discoveries by others will render our oligonucleotide technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
clinical trials are costly and time consuming and are subject to delays 
clinical trials are very costly and time consuming 
how quickly we are able to complete a clinical study depends upon several factors  including the size of the patient population  how easily patients can get to the site of the clinical study  and the criteria for determining which patients are eligible to join the study 
delays in patient enrollment could delay completion of a clinical study and increase its costs  and could also delay the commercial sale of the drug that is the subject of the clinical trial 
our commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials also may be delayed by many other factors  including the following inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials  inability to adequately monitor patient progress after treatment  unforeseen safety issues  the failure of the products to perform well during clinical trials  and government or regulatory delays 
we cannot market and sell our products in the united states or in other countries if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals 
the united states food and drug administration and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial premarket approval requirements on the introduction of pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed preclinical and clinical testing procedures and other costly and time consuming procedures 
satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years or more depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
while limited trials of our products have produced favorable results  we cannot apply for fda approval to market any of our products under development until the product successfully completes its preclinical and clinical trials 
several factors could prevent successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials  including an inability to enroll the required number of patients or failure to demonstrate adequately that the product is safe and effective for use in humans 
if safety concerns develop  the fda could stop our trials before completion 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of our products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of our products could be limited 
we cannot assure the commercial success of our products 
even if our products are successfully developed and approved by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies  they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
several factors could limit our success  including possible limited market acceptance among patients  physicians  medical centers and third party payors  our inability to access a sales force capable of marketing the product  our inability to supply a significant amount of product to meet market demand  and the number an relative efficacy of competitive products that may subsequently enter the market 
in addition  it is possible that we  or our collaborative partners  will be unsuccessful in developing  marketing and implementing a commercialization strategy for our products 
we may be unable to obtain or enforce patents and other proprietary rights to protect our business 
our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to obtain us and foreign patent or other proprietary protection for our technologies  products and processes  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties 
legal standards relating to the validity of patents covering pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions and the scope of claims made under such patents are still developing 
there is no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
as a result  our ability to obtain and enforce patents that protect our drugs is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
we have more than us and international patents and applications to aspects of oligonucleotide technology  which includes novel compositions of matter  methods of large scale synthesis and methods of controlling gene expression 
we may not receive any issued patents based on pending or future applications 
our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against competitors with similar technology 
additionally  our patents  our partners patents and patents for which we have license rights may be challenged  narrowed  invalidated or circumvented 
furthermore  rights granted under our patents may not cover commercially valuable drugs or processes and may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may have to initiate arbitration or litigation to enforce our patent and license rights 
if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology or to license the disputed rights from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
the cost to us of any litigation or proceeding relating to patent rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any pending patent or related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we rely on our collaborative arrangements with research institutions and corporate partners for development of our products 
our business strategy depend in part on our continued ability to develop and maintain relationships with leading academic and research institutions and independent researchers 
the competition for such relationships is intense  and we can give no assurances that we will be able to develop and maintain such relationships on acceptable terms 
we have entered into a number of collaborative relationships relating to specific disease targets and other research activities in order to augment our internal research capabilities and to obtain access to specialized knowledge and expertise 
the loss of any of these collaborative relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
similarly  strategic alliances with corporate partners  primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  may help us develop and commercialize drugs 
various problems can arise in strategic alliances 
a partner responsible for conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval may fail to develop a marketable drug 
a partner may decide to pursue an alternative strategy or alternative partners 
a partner that has been granted marketing rights for a certain drug within a geographic area may fail to market the drug successfully 
consequently  strategic alliances that we may enter into in the future may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
we may be unable to negotiate advantageous strategic alliances in the future 
the absence of  or failure of  strategic alliances could harm our efforts to develop and commercialize our drugs 
the raw materials for our products are produced by a limited number of suppliers 
the raw materials that we require to manufacture our drugs  particularly oligonucleotides  are available from only a few suppliers  namely those with access to our patented technology 
furthermore  we currently rely on a potential competitor  which is itself a development stage biotechnology company  to supply us with chemical compounds necessary to the development of our drugs 
if these few suppliers cease to provide us with the necessary raw materials or fail to provide us with adequate supply of materials at an acceptable price and quality  we could be materially adversely affected 
our business will suffer if we fail to compete effectively with our competitors and to keep up with new technologies 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and may become even more competitive 
we will need to continue to devote substantial efforts and expense to research and development in order to maintain a competitive position 
it is possible that developments by others may succeed in developing other new therapeutic drug candidates that are more effective and less costly than those that we propose to develop and may render our current and proposed products or technologies obsolete 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources and more experience in research and development than we have 
competitors that complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us will enjoy a significant competitive advantage 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and alternative technologies become available 
furthermore  biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change 
we expect that the technologies associated with biotechnology research and development will continue to develop rapidly 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to compete with these technologies 
any compounds  drugs or processes that we develop may become obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred in developing them 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of our products from third party payors 
our ability to commercialize drugs successfully will depend in part on the extent to which various third parties are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of our drugs and related treatments 
these third parties include government authorities  private health insurers  and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payors often challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
accordingly  if less costly drugs are available  third party payors may not authorize or may limit reimbursement for our drugs  even if they are safer or more effective than the alternatives 
in addition  the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the united states 
in particular  these third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products 
in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we or our partners succeed in bringing therapeutic products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
we could become involved in time consuming and expensive patent litigation and adverse decisions in patent litigation could cause us to incur additional costs and experience delays in bringing new drugs to market 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have been characterized by time consuming and extremely expensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may be required to commence  or may be made a party to  litigation relating to the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights  or the intellectual property rights of others 
such litigation could result in adverse decisions regarding the patentability of our inventions and products  or the enforceability  validity  or scope of protection offered by our patents 
such decisions could make us liable for substantial money damages  or could bar us from the manufacture  use  or sale of certain products  resulting in additional costs and delays in bringing drugs to market 
we may not have sufficient resources to bring any such proceedings to a successful conclusion 
it may be that entry into a licensing arrangement would allow us to avoid any such proceedings 
we may not be able  however  to enter into any such licensing arrangement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office and in international trade commission proceedings aimed at preventing the importing of drugs that would compete unfairly with our drugs 
such proceedings could cause us to incur considerable costs 
our business exposes us to potential product liability 
the nature of our business exposes us to potential product and professional liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of human therapeutic products 
while we are covered against those claims by a product liability insurance policy subject to various deductibles  we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any claim 
uninsured product liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  it is possible that any insurance will not provide us with adequate protection against potential liabilities 
we have used hazardous materials and could be held liable for damages for past or accidental contamination or injury 
in october of  jbl hired an environmental consulting firm to investigate an incident of soil and groundwater contamination at jbl s facility 
sampling of soil and groundwater revealed the presence of contaminants 
the california regional water quality control board is monitoring the situation 
results of recent testing have indicated a reduction in contaminant levels 
the company accrued  in to pay for any potential liability 
we have agreed to indemnify promega corporation  the purchaser of jbl s assets  for any liability that may result from this alleged contamination 
we believe that any costs that result from further investigation or remediation will not have a material adverse effect on our operation  but we can give no assurance to that end 
on october   the environmental protection agency identified jbl as a de minimis potentially responsible party at a california waste disposal facility showing evidence of environmental contamination 
the epa currently estimates that genta will be required to pay approximately  to settle its potential liability 
we have agreed to indemnify promega corporation for any costs resulting from this contamination 
based on the volume amount from the epa  genta accrued  to pay for any potential liability arising from this incident 
we are expecting to finalize the terms of settlement by the second quarter of we believe that any costs that result from further investigation or remediation will not have a material adverse affect on our operation  but we can give no assurance to that end 
if we cease doing business and liquidate our assets  we are required to distribute proceeds to holders of our preferred stock before we distribute proceeds to holders of our common stock 
in the event of a dissolution or liquidation of genta  holders of genta common stock will not receive any proceeds until holders of  outstanding shares of genta series a preferred stock are paid a million dollar liquidation preference and holders of  outstanding shares of genta series d preferred stock are paid a million dollar liquidation preference 
we are also obligated to issue an additional  shares of series d preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of million  upon the exercise of some outstanding warrants

concentration of ownership of our stock could lead to a delay or prevent a change of control 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock and preferred stock 
they also own  through the exercise of options and warrants  the right to acquire even more common stock and preferred stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if acting together  have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of genta

claims of genta s default under various agreements during  genta pharmaceuticals europe sa genta europe  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  received approximately million french francs or  as of december  approximately  of funding in the form of a loan from the french government agency l agence nationale de valorisation de la recherche anvar towards research and development activities pursuant to an agreement the anvar agreement between anvar  genta europe and genta 
in october  as part of the company s restructuring program  genta europe terminated all scientific personnel 
anvar asserted  in a letter dated february   that genta europe was not in compliance with the anvar agreement  and that anvar might request the immediate repayment of such loan 
on july   anvar notified genta europe by letter of its claim that the company remains liable for ff  as of december   approximately  and is required to pay this amount immediately 
the company does not believe that under the terms of the anvar agreement anvar is entitled to request early repayment 
anvar notified genta incorporated that it was responsible as a guarantor of the note for the repayment 
genta s agent in europe has again notified anvar that it does not agree that the note is payable 
the company is working with anvar to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution 
however  there can be no assurance that such a resolution will be obtained 
on june   marseille amenagement  a company affiliated with the city of marseilles  france  filed suit in france to evict genta europe from its facilities in marseilles and to demand payment of alleged back rent due and of a lease guarantee for nine years rent 
following the filing of this claim and in consideration of the request for repayment of the loan from anvar  genta europe s board of directors directed the management to declare a cessation of payment 
under this procedure  genta europe ceased any operations and terminated its only employee 
a liquidator was appointed by the court to take control of any assets of genta europe and to make payment to creditors 
in december  the court in marseilles dismissed the case against genta europe and indicated that it had no jurisdiction against genta incorporated 
in august  marseille amenagement instituted legal proceedings against the company at the commercial court in france  claiming alleged back rent payment of ff  as of december   approximately  and early termination payment of ff  as of december   approximately 
a court hearing has been scheduled for may  the company is working with its counsel in france to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution 
however  there can be no assurance that such a resolution will be obtained 
on december   the company has  of net liabilities of liquidated subsidiary recorded and  therefore  management believes no additional accrual is necessary 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs in relation to this claim 
dividends the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company is restricted from paying cash dividends on its common stock until such time as all cumulative dividends have been paid on outstanding shares of its series d preferred stocks 
the company currently intends to retain its earnings  if any  after payment of dividends on outstanding shares of series d preferred stocks  for the development of its business

need for and dependence on qualified personnel the company s success is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of key personnel and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional personnel or both is likely further to impede the achievement of development objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that genta will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
volatility of stock price  market overhang from outstanding convertible securities and warrants the market price of the company s common stock  like that of the common stock of many other biopharmaceutical companies  has been highly volatile and may be so in the future 
factors such as  among other things  the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials by the company or its competitors  other evidence of the safety or efficacy of products of the company or its competitors  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by the company or its competitors  governmental regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights of the company or its respective competitors  including litigation  fluctuations in the company s operating results  and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general could have a significant impact on the future price of the common stock 
as of march   the company had  shares of common stock outstanding 
future sales of shares of common stock by existing stockholders  holders of preferred stock who might convert such preferred stock into common stock  and option and warrant holders also could adversely affect the market price of the common stock
