this following discussion includes forward looking statements regarding expectations of future profitability of the us books business  gross margin  improvement in operating loss and sales  all of which are inherently difficult to predict

results of operations net sales change change in thousands net sales    net sales include the selling price of products sold by us  net of returns and gift certificate discounts  and also include outbound shipping charges 
shipping revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net sales also include commissions from auctions and zshops transactions  which include sales commissions  placement fees and fees from payment service transactions 
growth in net sales in and reflects a significant increase in units sold due to the growth of our customer base  repeat purchases from existing customers  increased international sales  and the introduction of new product offerings 
these new product offerings include music and dvd video in june and november of  respectively  toys and electronics in july and home improvement  software and video games in november we increased our issuance of promotional gift certificates to customers in to promote new product lines  however  which partially offset such growth in net sales 
the company had approximately million  million and million cumulative customer accounts as of december   and  respectively 
the percentage of orders by repeat customers increased from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the increase in net sales in was also partially due to the launch of the uk and german focused web sites in october sales to customers outside of the us represented approximately  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit change change in thousands gross profit    gross margin gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales  which consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers  as well as inbound and outbound shipping costs and the cost of tangible supplies used to package product for shipment to customers 
gross profit increased in and in absolute dollars  reflecting the company s increased sales volume 
gross margin decreased in due to the introduction of new product lines  particularly toys and electronics  and inventory related charges of approximately million incurred in the fourth quarter of we also increased our issuance of promotional gift certificates to customers in to promote these new product lines  which decreased net sales and  therefore  gross margin 
additionally  we realized lower shipping margins in due to an increase in partial shipments to satisfy holiday demand and because of split shipments from one or more locations  which was caused by our failure to optimize inventory at our distribution centers 
gross margin increased in as compared to as a result of improvements in product costs through improved supply chain management  including increased direct purchasing from publishers  as well as higher overall shipping margins 
these two factors more than offset the impact of aggressive product pricing and lower music and video margins 
as noted above  outbound shipping costs are included in cost of sales 
gross profit from shipping  which represents shipping revenues less outbound shipping costs  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect our overall gross margin to approach for the first quarter of and for the year 
we believe that offering our customers attractive prices is an essential component of our business strategy 
for example  we offer everyday discounts of on every book on the new york times bestseller list  up to on hundreds of thousands of titles and up to on certain special value editions 
we may in the future expand or increase the discounts we offer to our customers and may otherwise alter our pricing structure and policies in a manner that may adversely impact gross profit and gross margin 
we intend to continue to expand our operations by promoting new or complementary products or sales formats and by expanding the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings 
gross margins attributable to new business areas may be different from those associated with our existing business activities 
to the extent such product lines become larger components of our sales  we would expect a corresponding impact on overall product gross margin 
we believe that the amazon 
com commerce network will tend to increase gross margins in the future because the revenue associated with the activities conducted by amazon 
com commerce network generates substantially higher gross profit than the company s sale of products 
see business additional factors that may affect future results our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making and integrating business combinations and strategic alliances 
organizations responsible for promulgating accounting standards are currently reviewing the financial statement classification of  and accounting for  fulfillment and order processing costs and other items by a number of e commerce companies  including amazon 
com 
the review by these accounting organizations may lead to new accounting standards that could require that some or all of our fulfillment and order processing costs be classified as costs of sales 
we currently include these costs in marketing and sales 
these new standards could also require us to capitalize certain of our fulfillment and order processing costs in inventory 
we currently expense these costs as incurred 
we will adjust our accounting and classification of fulfillment and order processing costs if required by accounting organizations or by the sec 
marketing and sales change change in thousands marketing and sales    percentage of net sales marketing and sales expenses consist of advertising  promotional and public relations expenditures  credit card fees and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  selling and fulfillment activities

fulfillment costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
marketing and sales expenses increased in and primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand  increases in our advertising and promotional expenditures in the us  germany and the uk  and increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales 
the increase in was further attributable to increased advertising during the holiday season and the promotion of the new toys  electronics  software  video games and home improvement stores 
the increase in was also attributable to the entry into music and video sales and the launch of new web sites targeting germany and the uk 
marketing and sales expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in as compared to primarily due to increases in fulfillment expenses associated with our expansion of our distribution center network and customer service staff during marketing and sales expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in due to the significant increase in net sales 
we intend to continue our advertising and marketing activities in the future and expect that such expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but  as a percentage of sales  will likely decline in the future 
we also expect that fulfillment costs will decline as a percentage of sales in the future as additional capacity of our existing distribution center network is more fully utilized 
however  due to risks related to market share  seasonality  distribution centers  inventory management and other factors  advertising and marketing expenditures and fulfillment costs may not decline as a percentage of sales

technology and content change change in thousands technology and content    percentage of net sales technology and content expenses consist principally of payroll and related expenses for development  editorial  systems and telecommunications operations personnel and consultants  systems and telecommunications infrastructure  and costs of acquired content  including freelance reviews 
the increases in technology and content expenses in and were primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated costs related to continual enhancements to the features  content and functionality of our web sites and transaction processing systems  as well as increased investment in systems and telecommunications infrastructure 
these increases also were the result of the costs of developing  introducing and operating new product lines  operating expenses associated with acquired entities and  in  the costs of developing  introducing and operating new web sites targeting germany and the uk 
technology and content expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in due to the significant number of new product lines and services launched by us during the year 
technology and content expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in due to the significant increase in net sales 
technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred  except for certain costs relating to the development of internal use software that are capitalized and depreciated over estimated useful lives 
we believe that continued investment in technology and content is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
in addition to ongoing investments in our web stores and infrastructure  we intend to increase investments in products  services and international expansion 
as a result  we expect technology and content expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative change change in thousands general and administrative    percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  recruiting  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
the and increases in general and administrative expenses were primarily a result of increased salaries and related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel and legal and other professional fees related to our growth 
in both and  additional expenses were incurred associated with acquired entities and the related international expansion and expanded activities 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur additional costs to support the growth of our business 
stock based compensation change change in thousands stock based compensation     percentage of net sales stock based compensation is comprised of the portion of acquisition related consideration conditioned on the continued tenure of key employees of the acquired businesses  which must be classified as compensation expense rather than as a component of purchase price under generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation also includes stock based charges such as option related deferred compensation recorded at our initial public offering  as well as certain other compensation and severance arrangements 
the increase in stock based compensation in resulted primarily from acquisitions closed in stock based compensation for and relates primarily to option related deferred compensation recorded at the time of our initial public offering 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles change change in thousands amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles   n m increases in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in primarily resulted from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded at the time of our acquisitions of exchange 
com  alexa internet  accept 
com  livebid 
com  the catalog and online commerce assets of acme electric motor co 
tool crib of the north  back to basics toys and other acquisitions 
in  amortization charges resulted from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles recorded in the acquisitions of junglee and three smaller internet companies 
we expect that amortization charges from the acquisitions consummated in will increase in based on a full year of amortization for all of the acquisitions 
it is likely that we will continue to expand our business through acquisitions  which would cause amortization of goodwill and other intangibles to increase 
loss from operations change change in thousands loss from operations    percentage of net sales our loss from operations increased from to  and from to  due to continued expansion of our business 
our operating expenses have historically increased more quickly than our revenues as we have expanded our operations 
we expect that our overall loss from operations incurred in will decrease significantly as a percentage of net sales  compared to that percentage in interest income and expense change change in thousands interest income    interest expense    interest income on cash and marketable securities increased in due to higher investment balances resulting from the proceeds from the issuance of billion of convertible subordinated notes due the convertible subordinated notes in february and increased in due to the issuance of approximately million gross proceeds of senior discount notes due may  the senior discount notes in may interest expense increased in and due to the interest expense associated with this debt  as well as amortization of deferred charges associated with issuance of the notes 
on february   we completed an offering of e   as of february  of convertible subordinated notes due  also known as premium adjustable convertible securities  or peacs 
therefore  we expect interest expense to increase in the future for interest associated with these notes 
equity in losses of equity method investees change change in thousands equity in losses of equity method investees    n m equity in losses of equity method investees represents our share of losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over an investee 
this is generally defined as an ownership interest of the voting stock of the investee of between and 
we made several equity method investments in and increased our investment in the equity method investment we made in we expect to make additional equity method investments in the future 
many of the companies in which we have invested to date are in the early stage of their operations and are incurring net losses 
therefore  we expect to continue to record losses on our equity method investments 
in july  one of our equity method investees  drugstore 
com  inc  completed the initial public offering of its common stock 
drugstore 
com operates an online retail store and information site for health  beauty  wellness  personal care and pharmacy products 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a contribution to additional paid in capital of million  representing the difference between the carrying value of our investment and the underlying net book value of drugstore 
com after the ipo 
two of our other equity method investees  pets 
com and homegrocer 
com  completed their ipos in february and march  respectively 
we therefore will record a contribution to additional paid in capital in connection with these transactions  and it is reasonably possible that other equity method investees may complete ipos in the future 
income taxes we did not provide any current or deferred us federal  state or foreign income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  which begin to expire in  may be subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and other limitations under state and foreign tax laws 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding its realizability 
pro forma information pro forma information regarding our results  which excludes amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  stock based compensation  equity in losses of equity method investees and merger  acquisition and investment related costs  is as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share amount pro forma loss from operations  pro forma net loss  pro forma basic and diluted loss per share shares used in computation of pro forma basic and diluted loss per share  using the methodology described above to derive pro forma loss from operations  our us books business was profitable in the fourth quarter of and we expect this business to be profitable in the pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash balance was million  compared to million at december  our marketable securities balance  which includes highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities amounted to million for this was primarily attributable to the net loss for the year of million  partially offset by non cash charges related to depreciation  stock based compensation  amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles  and equity in losses of equity method investees totaling million  as well as million of cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities is primarily a function of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
for  net cash provided by operating activities was million and was primarily attributable to non cash expenses and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  largely offset by the net loss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of fixed assets of million and cash paid for acquisitions and investments in businesses of million 
net cash used in investing activities during was million and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of fixed assets of million and cash paid for acquisitions and investments in businesses of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of billion for was primarily due to billion of proceeds from the sale of our convertible subordinated notes in february  partially offset by repayment of long term debt  including million of cash paid to repurchase a portion of our outstanding senior discount notes 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for primarily resulted from net proceeds of approximately million from the senior discount notes offering offset by the repayment of million of long term debt 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash and marketable securities 
as of that date  our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes due and senior discount notes  as well as obligations in connection with operating leases and commitments for advertising and promotional arrangements 
during  we undertook a substantial expansion of our distribution center network in the us  adding six distribution centers in the us 
we also opened new distribution centers in the uk and germany 
we anticipate that our current distribution center capacity in the us will be adequate for our needs for at least the next months  but we may require additional capacity in international markets 
in may  we completed the offering of approximately million gross proceeds of the senior discount notes  in february  we completed the offering of approximately billion convertible subordinated notes  and in february  we completed the offering of e million of convertible subordinated notes due  also knows as peacs 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference to item of part ii 
we believe that current cash and marketable securities balances  together with net proceeds from the peacs  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain credit facilities from lenders 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
in addition  we will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  and the repurchase and retirement of debt  which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
year implications many currently installed computer systems  software programs and embedded data chips are programmed using a two digit date field and are therefore unable to distinguish dates beyond the th century 
a failure to identify and correct any mission critical internal or third party year processing problem could have a material adverse operational or financial consequence to us 
we established a year project team that  together with external consultants  developed a process for addressing the year issue  including performing an inventory  an assessment  remediation procedures to the extent necessary and testing procedures of all mission critical information systems and equipment and machinery that contain embedded technology  as well as obtaining assurances from all mission critical third parties as to their own year preparedness 
as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k  all of our mission critical systems have been successfully tested for year compliance  and we have not experienced any significant year problems with our own mission critical systems or any mission critical third parties 
although we have not experienced any significant year problems to date  we plan to continue to monitor the situation closely 
we cannot be sure that we will be completely successful in our efforts to address the year issue or that problems arising from the year issue will not cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
we believe  however  that our most reasonably likely worst case scenario would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with our internal systems 
we are limited in our efforts to address the year issue as it relates to third parties and rely solely on the assurances of these third parties as to their year preparedness 
as part of our broader contingency planning  we also developed business continuity plans to address each critical process and activity that we believe would cause a significant disruption to operations if not functional for hours 
despite these efforts  we cannot guarantee that the contingency plan will adequately address all circumstances that may disrupt operations or that such planning will prevent circumstances that may cause a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our marketable securities portfolio as of december  however  we are exposed to interest rate risk on debt instruments we hold 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale as of december  and our senior discount notes  convertible subordinated notes  peacs and other long term debt have fixed interest rates and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
our exposure to currency exchange risk through december  has not been material 
however  with the completion of the offering of peacs notes on february   we will be exposed to currency exchange risk because the debt is denominated in euros while our functional currency is the us dollar 
we plan to employ established policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
additionally  the conversion price for the peacs is denominated in euros
