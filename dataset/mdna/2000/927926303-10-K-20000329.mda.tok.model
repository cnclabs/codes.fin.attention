item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation for the three years ended december  and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
differences from united states gaap are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  and  the corporation s primary mining operation and principal source of earnings was the hycroft mine formerly known as the crofoot lewis mine in nevada  which began gold production in in december  mining activities were suspended at the hycroft mine 
gold processing and recovery continued from previously mined and inventoried ore in and is expected to continue in  with gold production for estimated to be in excess of  ounces 
on december   mineral ridge inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  voluntarily filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code after the mineral ridge mine failed to meet minimum cash flow levels required under mineral ridge inc s loan with dresdner bank due to ore reserve deficiencies and low gold prices 
see item properties mineral ridge mine 
the loan was not guaranteed by  and the lender has no recourse to  the corporation 
results of operations compared with the net loss was million as compared to the net loss of million 
the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties 
there was no similar write down in the net loss included a one time gain on the liquidation of gold futures of million and a million gain from the disposal of assets  while there were no similar gains in excluding the write down of mineral properties and the gains from the liquidation of gold futures and disposal of assets  the net loss of million increased million from the loss of million 
the million increase in net losses in was due to substantially lower gold revenues partially offset by lower operating costs  both of which reflect the corporation s lower gold production and operating levels in as compared to the corporation s average gross realized price continued to decline in reflecting the lower average spot price of gold for gold sales of million in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease in gold sales was primarily because of lower gold production combined with the lower average gold prices realized by the corporation 
average gross realized price average spot price gold sales s   gold production ounces   gold production decreased  ounces from  in to  ounces in the decrease in gold production was attributable to the suspension of mining activities at the hycroft mine in  which was partially offset by the start up of mining activities at the mineral ridge mine in gold production from the two mines was as follows 
ounces hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total gold production   there was no ore mined at the hycroft mine in all gold production from the hycroft mine was from previously mined and inventoried ore 
at the mineral ridge mine  million tons of ore were mined in  as compared to million tons of ore in the average grade of the ore mined in was ounces of gold per ton 
during the initial mining and processing start up activities at mineral ridge  various mechanical problems were encountered 
these problems  primarily in the crushing plant  inhibited the mine s ability to place ore onto the heaps for leaching and gold extraction 
as the mine continued to operate in  the mechanical problems were addressed and crusher production improved in the third quarter of to an average of  tons per month  which was in line with corporation s projections 
however  the mine then began to experience ore deficiencies during mining operations  as compared to original ore reserve estimates  and gold production failed to meet expectations 
operating costs from mining operations decreased million from million in to million in mining  processing and other costs accounted for million  million and million of the decrease in operating costs  respectfully 
the decrease was primarily due to the elimination of mining activities at the hycroft mine  which was partially offset by the commencement of mining activities at the mineral ridge mine 
operating costs at the two mines were as follows 
in thousands hycroft mine   mineral ridge mine  total operating costs   the cash operating cost per ounce at the two mines was as follows 
per ounce hycroft mine mineral ridge mine total operating costs the cash operating costs at the mineral ridge mine for the two months ended december  have been omitted because the mine was in the initial start up phase and accordingly  it is not possible to accurately determine the true cash operating costs 
mining costs in decreased million as a result of mining fewer tons at a lower average cost per ton 
total tons mined  including waste tons  decreased to million tons in from million tons in the average cost per ton mined decreased to in  as compared to in in  inefficiencies associated with the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine resulted in a higher average mining cost per ton 
in  there was no mining at the hycroft mine and all mining activities occurred at the mineral ridge mine 
processing costs  including changes in inventory  decreased million in as a result of treating fewer tons of ore as compared to ore tons processed decreased to million tons in from million tons in at the hycroft mine  while no additional ore was placed on the heaps in  processing activities still continued throughout the year as previously mined and inventoried ore was treated for gold extraction 
processing activities at the mineral ridge mine included placing and treating million tons of ore in other operating costs including mine administration  refining and freight costs  and silver credits decreased million in excluding silver credits  other operating costs decreased million reflecting the efficiencies of combining the administrative functions of the two mines and the corporation s efforts to minimize costs 
however  lower silver production and sales offset million of the million decrease 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a in of million decreased million from million in at the hycroft mine  dd a decreased million and was directly related to the suspension of mining activities in dd a at the mineral ridge mine increased million reflecting the start up of mining activities in the provision for reclamation and closure costs of million in decreased dramatically from million in in  the higher provision compensated for the revised hycroft mine plan  which called for the reduction and subsequent suspension of mining activities in december in  the provision of million was solely from the mineral ridge mine 
operating lease costs in decreased to  as compared to million in during  the leases on several large pieces of mobile mining equipment terminated and the equipment was purchased at the end of the leases 
during  the corporation did not have any major equipment leases 
mineral exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in as compared to million in the costs included million in holding costs for the corporation s bolivian properties as compared to million in the corporation incurred these holding costs while maintaining and protecting its property interests in bolivia 
also included in the costs were million for exploration and evaluation work at the hycroft mine  million for exploration at the mineral ridge mine  and million of other exploration and evaluation expenditures 
at the hycroft mine  gold production from the brimstone deposit consistently exceeded the corporation s projections 
as a result  the corporation conducted preliminary studies in to determine the source and quantity of the excess gold production 
the studies indicated that during the period of through  gold production from the north end of the brimstone deposit exceeded planned production by  ounces  or 
the excess gold production was a result of mining more ore tons at a higher average grade than predicted in the exploration reserve model 
the brimstone deposit was not completely mined when mining activities were suspended in december and the corporation is investigating the possibility of restarting mining operations at the hycroft mine 
corporate administration and investor relations decreased million in to million as the corporation continued to reduce its overhead and administrative costs 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  reflecting the corporation s higher average debt balance during the year 
the increase in the average debt balance was directly related to the additional debt of mineral ridge inc in  the gain on the disposal of assets was million and primarily consisted of the sales of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine and the sale of the corporation s non producing tartan mine in canada 
there was no similar gain or loss from the disposal of assets in management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
these evaluations indicated that the carrying values of certain properties and investments were overstated and  accordingly  were written down 
based upon management s evaluation  million was written down in  including bolivian mineral properties million  mineral ridge mine net assets million  and zamora accounts receivable million 
additionally  the corporation wrote off its remaining investment of million in zamora  reflecting its decreased levels of ownership and control 
there were no similar write downs in income tax expense in was nil as compared to million in the income tax expense was primarily the result of us alternative minimum taxes  which limited the corporation s ability to utilize existing loss carry forwards 
compared with the net loss for was million compared to a net loss of million in the net loss included gains of million from the disposal of assets  while the net loss included gains of million from the disposal of assets 
the net loss also included a one time gain on the liquidation of gold futures of million  while there was no similar gain in the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties and investments 
there were no similar write downs in excluding gains from the liquidation of gold futures and the disposal of assets  and write downs of mineral properties and investments  the net loss of was slightly less than the loss of million 
average gross realized prices declined in as the gold spot price continued to drop 
gold revenues of million in decreased million  or from  primarily because of the lower average gross realized price combined with a decrease in gold production 
gold ounces   average gross realized price gold production decreased  ounces from  in to  ounces in the decrease in gold production was attributable to the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine 
in  million ore tons were mined as compared to million ore tons in while ore tons mined decreased in  gold production only decreased 
the positive variance was largely due to measures taken in to improve solution flow rates and gold production  combined with higher than expected ore grades in lower average cash balances led to lower interest income for the year 
interest income in was million as compared to million in total revenues of million were unchanged from operating costs from mining operations decreased million from to million in the decrease was due to the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine 
total tons mined  including waste tons  decreased to million tons in from million tons in the average cost per ton mined increased to in  as compared to in  as a result of inefficiencies associated with the reduction in mining activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in of million was relatively unchanged from however  the provision for reclamation and closure costs of million in increased dramatically from million in the increase compensated for the new hycroft mine plan  which called for the reduction and subsequent suspension of mining activities in the new mine plan optimized the mine s ore reserve in light of reduced gold prices and concentrated on lower production cost ounces 
amortization and accrual rates increased because of the reduction in total tons and ounces called for in the new mine plan 
operating lease costs in decreased to million as compared to million in during  the leases on several large pieces of mobile mining equipment terminated and the equipment was purchased at the end of the leases 
the corporation does not have any other outstanding major equipment leases 
mineral exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in holding costs for the corporation s bolivian properties were million in the corporation incurred these holding costs while maintaining and protecting its property interests in bolivia  operating its administrative office in la paz  and sustaining its development and social operations at the amayapampa and capa circa properties 
there were no similar costs in excluding the bolivian holding costs  mineral exploration and property evaluation expenses were million as compared to million in the million decrease reflects the corporation s efforts to control costs and conserve cash in during  the corporation s exploration efforts were focused on latin america and the mineral ridge mine in nevada 
corporate administration and investor relations decreased million in to million as the corporation continued to reduce its overhead and administrative costs 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  reflecting the corporation s lower average debt balance during the year 
in  the gain on the disposal of assets was million and primarily consisted of the sales of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine and the sale of the corporation s non producing tartan mine in canada 
as discussed above  the corporation liquidated its forward position in the gold futures market in january as a result  net hedging gains of million were realized  of which million was recognized immediately as other revenue with the balance deferred to subsequent periods 
no such gain was recorded in income tax expense increased million in to million  primarily as a result of us alternative minimum taxes  which limit the corporation s ability to utilize existing loss carry forwards 
management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
in  the carrying values of certain properties and investments were written down by million 
no similar write down was required in year as the year approached  there were uncertainties concerning whether computer systems would properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changed to systems that did not properly recognize such information could have generated erroneous data or failed 
the corporation s computer systems and software were configured to accommodate dates beyond the year prior to the year changing to the year did not pose any major operational problems for the corporation s computer systems 
the corporation s computer systems are functioning properly and the corporation has not experienced any internal difficulties due to the year issue  nor has it experienced any difficulties due to a third party s inability to adequately address year issues 
there were no material effects on the corporation s financial results as a result of year issues 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s consolidated cash balance at december  was million  a decrease of million from the end of the previous year 
during  operating activities consumed million  investing activities consumed million  and financing activities generated million for a net decrease to cash of million 
operating activities consumed million in and were as follows 
in thousands hycroft mine  mineral ridge mine  bolivian properties  corporate activities  net operating costs  the hycroft mine generated million of cash from operating activities  net of million in reclamation and closure costs 
before reclamation and closure costs  the mine generated million of cash 
mining activities at the hycroft mine were suspended in december in  the mine continued to produce gold from previously mined and inventoried ore without the burden of mining costs and with the benefit of reduced operating levels 
as a result  the mine produced  ounces of gold at a cash cost of per ounce 
however  excluding changes in inventory  the true cash operating cost was per ounce 
the mineral ridge mine encountered various mechanical difficulties as well as ore shortfalls during and  although operating costs were at or below plan  gold production was well below plan 
as a result  the operating cash flow at the mine was seriously impaired and million of cash was consumed 
bolivian and corporate activities required million and million in cash  respectively 
during  the corporation held and maintained its bolivian properties  and at the same time steps were undertaken to minimize future property holding costs 
past efforts to reduce the cash required for corporate activities have continued to be effective and the corporation will investigate other alternatives to reduce its corporate overhead 
investing activities consumed million in and primarily consisted of capital expenditures at the mineral ridge mine 
at the mineral ridge mine  capital expenditures in included million for the leach pad expansion and million for the replacement of a critical ore feeding component in the crushing plant 
at the hycroft mine  million was spent on two processing modifications designed to improve recoveries from the remaining gold inventory 
partially offsetting the capital expenditures were million in proceeds from the disposal of assets 
in  financing activities generated million 
during the year  the corporation borrowed million and repaid million under the terms of a million term loan  which was collateralized by certain mobile assets of the hycroft mine 
at the mineral ridge mine  the net repayment under the terms of its loans was million 
reclamation and environmental costs management estimates the reclamation and closure costs for the corporation s hycroft mine to be million 
these costs are charged to earnings over the life of the mine and the provision to date is million 
in april  the nevada bureau of land management blm approved an amended hycroft mine reclamation plan that included the brimstone deposit  and an uncollateralized surety bond in the amount of million was posted to secure reclamation obligations under the plan 
regulatory compliance and other matters during  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations 
going concern the corporation s consolidated cash balance was million as of december  management estimates consolidated total cash expenditures of million for if the current depressed market for gold prices continues into  it may be necessary for the corporation to modify its budget to achieve further reductions in operating and general and administrative expenses 
the corporation may require additional funding to maintain its properties in good standing and continue its operations throughout the next fiscal year 
the corporation relies on the hycroft mine as its only current source of operating cash flows 
mining activities at hycroft were suspended in during  hycroft produced gold from previously mined and inventoried ore on the leach pads  a process that will continue through however  hycroft s remaining gold inventory is decreasing and  therefore  gold production will continue to decrease throughout the year the corporation is also researching the economic feasibility of restarting the hycroft mine and developing the amayapampa project 
the corporation s ability to restart the hycroft mine and develop the amayapampa project is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital 
the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional capital 
management is actively pursuing additional sources of capital  including debt financing  the issuance of equity  mergers with other companies  and the sale of property interests 
in the event that management is unable to obtain additional capital  there is substantial doubt about the ability of the corporation to continue as a going concern 
outlook average gold prices continued to decline in and while there has been some recent price improvement  the corporation is making its plans on the assumption that low gold prices will persist in at the hycroft mine  gold processing and recovery continued from inventoried ore in and is expected to continue in the year  with gold production for estimated to be in excess of  ounces 
during  hycroft mine gold production consistently exceeded expectations and as a result  the corporation conducted a million exploration program to determine the extent of the remaining brimstone gold resource 
the corporation received advice during the reserve re estimation process from mineral resources development  inc mrdi  an independent consultant that was retained to endorse the recalculated mineable reserves 
the studies indicated that during the period of through  gold production from the north end of the brimstone deposit exceeded planned production by  ounces  or 
the excess gold production was a result of mining more ore tons at a higher average grade than predicted in the exploration reserve model 
the results of the program to date indicate that a mineable reserve in the brimstone orebody could be established 
the brimstone orebody was not completely mined out when mining activities were suspended in december a positive result from the program could reestablish a mineable reserve in the unmined portion of the brimstone deposit and allow the hycroft mine to resume mining operations and gold production 
currently  the corporation plans to maintain the plant and facilities on a standby basis until production can be restarted 
in the short term  the corporation will continue reclamation activities in areas that would not be affected by future operations 
in bolivia  the corporation recently completed a feasibility study on the amayapampa project 
based on a gold price of per ounce  the proven and probable reserves at amayapampa are calculated to be million tonnes million tons grading grams per tonne ounces per ton including dilution  containing  ounces of gold 
within this reserve  an optimized plan at a gold price of per ounce will generate an after tax internal rate of return of 
the initial capital costs are estimated to be million  including working capital and a contingency 
the corporation has been in discussions with various lenders regarding the debt financing component for the project and is exploring alternatives to complete the total financing package 
management is attempting to further reduce its corporate overhead costs and minimize discretionary expenditures in an effort to preserve capital 
the corporation believes that its current cash on hand is sufficient to continue producing gold from previously mined and inventoried ore at the hycroft mine 
however  the corporation will have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to restart mining activities at the hycroft mine or begin construction and development activities at the amayapampa project in bolivia 
accordingly  the corporation is actively investigating various alternatives  including debt financing  the issuance of equity  mergers with other companies  and the sale of property interests 
during  the corporation s activities will focus on the advancement of its two development projects and the preservation of its working capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the corporation is engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing  and refining and reclamation 
gold bullion is the corporation s principal product 
changes in the price of gold could affect the corporation s profitability and cash flows 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time 
for a description of factors that affect gold prices  see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  under item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements 
using current estimates of production at an estimated average gold price of per ounce  including the effects of the corporation s hedging position  if any  and management s estimate of expected operating expenses  a change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in net income and cash flows 
the corporation occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments for purposes other than trading purposes to manage the corporation s exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of gold by protecting the selling price of a portion of its production 
the market risk of these commodity instruments to the corporation s cash flow is related to the possible failure of all counterparties to honor their contractual obligations 
also  precious metals contracts between the corporation and various counterparties involve the requirement that the corporation deliver gold to the counterparty at agreed upon prices 
if the counterparty is unable to fulfill its purchase obligations  there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to receive the agreed upon sales price in the open market 
if the corporation is unable to produce sufficient gold to meet its hedging contract obligations  it may be obligated to purchase such gold at the then market price 
for further information regarding the corporation s hedging program  see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  under item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the corporation s had no outstanding forward sales contracts 
interest rate risk at december   the interest rate on the corporation s long term debt was 
the interest rate on this debt is fixed 
management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to major interest rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and all of the corporation s revenues and a majority of its expenses are incurred in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to any noteworthy foreign currency exchange rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
