the following chart summarizes certain key functions performed by our software products 
enterprise systems in store systems analytic applications decision support data warehouse merchandise management  applications application warehouse and logistics applications mms odbms win dss dss arthur suite retail ideas ibm as client server client server dos based client server ibm as windows nt inventory control cost and price management purchase order management automated replenishment merchandise planning transfer management and allocation warehouse and logistics management e commerce mms

these systems provide decision support to the retailer for core inventory control  cost and price management  purchase order management  automated replenishment  merchandise planning and allocation 
these systems also contain warehouse management and logistics functionality that provide tools to assist retailers in automating the receiving  putaway  picking  shipping and allocation of inventory 
we offer two merchandise management systems mms for the ibm as platform and odbms for open client server environments 
both systems consist of functional modules that can be selected by the client and configured to fit their unique requirements 
our enterprise systems can be integrated with our in store systems and analytic applications products or with systems designed by third parties 
our mms solution is specifically designed to take advantage of the ibm as database and operating environment 
we believe mms is one of the most installed merchandise management systems in the world and  to date  we have performed over mms implementations worldwide 
mms enables a retailer to adjust for changing strategies and competitive conditions by performing product price analyses based upon key data such as gross margin  sales volumes and competitive prices 
mms can then recommend and automate price changes based on the retailer s specifically defined pricing strategy 
we continue to invest in the development and enhancement of mms as we believe the ibm as platform is one of the favored operating platforms in the retail industry 
in addition  recent enhancements by hardware manufacturers such as ibm have improved the performance and database capabilities of the ibm as platform 
the next version of mms will include a new graphical user interface that will take advantage of the java enablement capabilities that are now available on the ibm as platform 
we also offer a comprehensive  business to consumer e commerce application for the ibm as platform that works in tandem with mms 
this solution  mms 
com  is a fully integrated e commerce application for the retail industry that allows retailers to automate their product catalogs  manage inventory and prices  verify credit  fulfill and ship orders  track customer information and process returns 
whereas many other vendors provide only the web storefront  our mms 
com e commerce application integrates all back end processing and enables a retailer to capitalize on an internet based sales and delivery system 
our odbms solution offers much of the same core functionality of mms while providing retailers with the benefits of an open client server architecture 
these benefits include flexibility in choosing a hardware platform and operating system  and improved connectivity  processing and scalability 
odbms is primarily designed to operate with oracle relational database management systems running on windows nt and the most popular unix platforms 
odbms features enhanced warehouse management and logistic automation tools such as bar coding and radio frequency technologies  and supports the information requirements of international and multi format retail organizations including multiple concurrent languages and currencies  user specific terminology  and user defined data structures 
we announced the commercial release of our next generation odbms open client server solution  version  in january this new version of odbms operates on the oracle relational database management system and provides expanded retail specific functionality and new modules for expert pricing  vendor submissions  rebate management and a business process level online help system 
in addition  retailers are provided improved security  international functionality and user interfaces  together with enhanced batch processing  online response time and database management performance 
we are developing a business to business e commerce application for open client service environments that integrates a front end e commerce server developed by blue martini software with the back end inventory management  order processing  promotional analysis and warehouse management functionality of odbms 
in addition  we have recently announced our intentions to develop a series of business to business e commerce solutions for mms and odbms 
these solutions include internet portals which are web based interfaces that provide retailers with a one stop destination for internal users  customers and suppliers to access multiple information sources and applications 
we believe the advantages offered by replacing a retailer s back office in store system functionality with internet portals is a very significant opportunity for us 
our first internet portal offering  store portal  will provide retailers with the functions necessary to access information on their merchandise management systems  via the internet  and execute associated processes to support their store operations 
this means that information residing on mms or odbms can be deployed on a browser and be accessible on a real time basis at the store level 
for example  a point of sale clerk would be able to use the store portal to check inventory levels or product descriptions stored on a database at the corporate office to respond to a consumer standing at the register or to initiate in store services such as special orders and home delivery 
we plan to develop and release additional internet portals in the future including a vendor portal  an analytic portal and a buyer portal 
in store systems our in store systems provide point of sale and back office applications that enable a retailer to capture  analyze and transmit operational and customer demographic information to corporate level merchandise management systems 
these systems allow store level personnel to access enterprise wide information  such as stock availability  inventory replenishment and pricing to better serve the consumer at the point of sale 
we offer two in store systems dss for dos based platforms and win dss for windows based environments 
dss and win dss consist of functional modules that can be selected by the client and configured to fit their unique requirements 
in addition to our in store systems solutions  the mms 
com application provides retailers with an alternative internet based sales and delivery system that works in tandem with mms 
our dss solution can be used with a customer s existing merchandise management system  or fully integrated with mms  to provide the retailer the ability to manage information through a wide range of retail operations 
a typical installation of dss enables the retailer to perform a number of individual store level functions and support back office  store inventory and point of sale operations 
for example  store managers can use dss to measure the results of a store promotional event 
in addition  dss enables retailers to track the preferences of individual consumers and provide a higher level of personalized service 
our win dss solution offers the same core functionality of dss while providing retailers with the enhanced capabilities of a windows based platform 
win dss incorporates an object oriented software design that can be configured to fit a retailer s unique business and processing requirements 
for example  a retailer can utilize the win dss multi tasking capabilities to simultaneously run credit authorizations  process transactions and update store inventory records 
in addition  win dss can provide a retailer s customer service desk with ready access to personal information and purchase histories of individual consumers 
win dss facilitates quick adjustments to a retailer s business information process flows to reflect changing store strategies during special promotions or periods of peak consumer traffic 
analytic applications our analytic applications provide a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing business results and trends  monitoring strategic plans and enabling tactical decisions 
we believe our analytic applications represent high performance merchandising options that compliment our enterprise and in store systems products 
we currently offer two analytic applications the arthur suite and retail ideas 
the arthur suite is a set of integrated decision support applications based on technology acquired from comshare  incorporated in june the arthur suite is a three tier application that is currently available for end user client applications on windows or nt  for application servers on nt  and for database servers on nt  aix  hp ux  and sun solaris 
the arthur suite is comprised of six core components arthur planning  a merchandise planning application  arthur allocation  a tool for product and store allocation decision making  arthur assortment planning  a tool for determining store product assortments  arthur information manager aim  a database that allows for central organization of data and applications  arthur performance analysis  a decision support tool which we distribute to the retail industry as a value added reseller  and boost sales and margin planning  a merchandise planning tool for the consumer packaged goods industry 
the arthur suite is designed to enable a retailer to readily access and evaluate store and enterprise performance  create coordinated plans for future seasons  and focus on the resources and factors necessary to improve client satisfaction and enhance profitability 
the arthur suite currently integrates with mms and we are in the process of developing complete integration with odbms 
we have announced our intentions to develop an internet portal for the arthur suite  the arthur e planning portal  that will enable collaborative planning over the internet so retailers can share plans and up to the minute results with their manufacturers  suppliers  and other trading partners 
on february   we signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets of intactix international  inc intactix  a leading provider of space management solutions for the retail industry and consumer product goods manufacturers 
we believe completion of this acquisition will enable us to develop and introduce several new applications in the arthur suite arthur pro space  a next generation planogramming solution that will allow users to build  analyze  and distribute graphical diagrams for space management  store layout planning and shelf assortment analysis  and a business to business e commerce solution  arthur pro space 
net  that will provide retailers with similar functionality and the ability to collaborate with their suppliers over the internet 
in addition  we will continue to market the other intactix space management solutions including pro space  a next generation planogramming application  intercept  a windows based space management application  autopilot  a space management automation tool  interrange  an assortment analysis and production tool  and pro floor  a top down retail floor planning tool 
retail ideas is a data warehouse system developed jointly with silvon software  inc that provides a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing business results  monitoring strategic plans and enabling tactical decisions 
retail ideas is currently available on the ibm as and windows nt platforms and a unix based version is under development 
retail ideas is designed as a packaged offering that enables retailers to monitor vendor performance  promotional effectiveness and distribution center productivity  and to analyze financial measurements related to sales and inventory  margins and profitability  merchandise categories and items  open and suggested orders  and promotional and pricing events 
retail ideas currently integrates with mms and may also be used with transactional systems designed by third parties 
we will continue to evaluate other high performance merchandising options to compliment our current analytic applications 
these may include applications for loss prevention  customer profiling  employee productivity  forecast based replenishment  and intelligent inventory balancing 
we believe the addition of any of these applications to our product suite would result from development efforts with strategic partners or through the acquisition of companies having these complementary products 
consulting  maintenance and other services we offer a wide range of retail specific professional services that are designed to enable our customers to rapidly achieve the benefits of our solutions  including project management  system planning  design and implementation  custom modifications  training and support services 
we believe our service offerings  generally referred to as optimum pathways  facilitate early success with our products  strengthen our relationships with our clients  and add to our industry specific knowledge base for use in future implementation and product development efforts 
although our service offerings are optional  we have found that substantially all of our clients utilize some or all of our services to some degree in connection with the implementation and ongoing support of our software products 
we believe our ability to offer these services provides an important source of operating income and a competitive advantage 
we also believe our retail specific consulting group is one of the largest in the world and as of december   we had employees in our service organization 
we are pursuing a strategy to increasingly utilize third party consultants  such as those from major systems integrators  to assist in certain large scale implementations and for extensive business process re engineering projects 
we believe sales of our enterprise systems and in store systems were affected during by deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality  and in the case of odbms  a limited number of referenceable implementations 
since our consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are to a significant extent dependent upon new software license sales  we expect future consulting  maintenance and other services revenues to decrease until we begin to experience an increased demand in our software license sales 
consulting services our consulting services group consists of business consultants  systems analysts and technical personnel with extensive retail industry experience 
the consulting services group assists retailers in all phases of systems development  including systems planning and design  customer specific configuration of application modules  and on site implementation or conversion from existing systems 
consulting services are generally billed on a time and expenses basis 
our consulting engagements have typically taken between six months and one year for enterprise systems  between four and eight months for in store systems  and between three and nine months for analytic applications 
certain of our open client server products  and in particular odbms  generally require increased levels of consulting services and longer implementation periods 
this results from the complexity of open client server platforms and the increased flexibility the odbms and win dss products provide retailers with respect to the ability to configure these products to their work flows and business processes 
education and training we offer a comprehensive education and training program for our clients  associates and business partners 
we initiated jda university in as a formal education program that combines lectures  demonstrations and hands on exercise sessions 
jda university features a curriculum for each of our software solutions  prepaid training packages  and a full time staff consisting of professional instructors and course developers 
the jda university curriculum ranges from introductory to advanced levels and includes application training on our software products  technical courses on design and data models for our products  and developer courses for programmers and designers 
courses are offered primarily at our in house classroom facilities in scottsdale  london and singapore  and in certain instances at client locations 
approximately  individuals attended jda university during customer support services we believe that providing quality  on going customer support is a critical element in establishing long term relationships with our clients and maintaining a high level of satisfaction 
we offer a comprehensive customer support program that includes maintenance  on line support and help desk services 
our standard maintenance support program consists of annual contracts that are paid on a monthly basis and which provide clients with the right to receive new releases and unspecified upgrades of our software products 
we also offer a global hour customer support service centralized in our corporate offices and optimum service offerings for our in store systems clients 
the majority of our clients have typically participated in one or more of our customer support programs 
customers our clients operate in a wide variety of retail markets and include traditional brick and mortar retailers  online retailers  multi channel retailers and manufacturers who sell directly to consumers  manage inventory cooperatively with retailers  or require sophisticated product planning capabilities 
we have provided our software solutions to over clients worldwide 
we have historically targeted retail organizations with to over store locations and annual sales of million to billion 
we believe  however  that the scalability and performance enhancements made to our enterprise systems products  and in particular odbms  have recently improved our ability to market our software solutions to large  multi national retail organizations with annual sales in excess of billion 
sales and marketing we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales force 
our domestic direct sales force is based in scottsdale  arizona and our international sales representatives are located in australia  brazil  canada  chile  france  japan  mexico  singapore and the united kingdom 
in addition  we leverage cooperative relationships with sales agents  distributors  and other vendors in certain international markets  including ibm in china  columbia  and india  id application a 
s in denmark and spl systems pty 
ltd 
in south africa 
the pursuit of additional relationships with system integrators  other major hardware vendors and the retail consulting groups of major accounting firms is also a component of our sales and marketing strategy 
we believe these relationships have and will continue to provide important endorsements  valuable product feedback and sales referrals 
our sales cycle has historically required six to nine months from generation of the sales lead to the execution of a software license agreement 
the sales cycle has tended to be longer for large  multi national retail organizations and retailers in certain geographic regions 
in addition  due to the complexity and technical nature of our software products  consulting and product development employees often participate directly in the sales cycle and educate prospective clients on the advantages of using our software solutions 
we believe that sales of our enterprise systems and in store systems were effected during by deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality  and in the case of odbms  a limited number of referenceable implementations 
although we expect sequential increases in software license revenues throughout  we remain cautious about our expectations for the first half of as we believe normal selling cycles are just now beginning to resume 
our marketing activities are designed to increase market awareness of our products and services and identify prospective clients 
press announcements and public relations activities commonly follow the execution of significant software license agreements 
we also combine attendance at key trade shows with a limited amount of focused advertising and direct mail campaigns to generate prospects 
in addition to these activities  our marketing personnel provide extensive support to the sales organization  including responding to requests for proposals  conducting product demonstrations  determining hardware specifications  and assistance in the development of corporate communications and marketing materials 
as of december   our sales and marketing organization consisted of employees in the united states and employees in our international offices 
product development and jda technology we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive and that speed to market is critical to our success 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our current products and develop new products that achieve market acceptance 
these new products must incorporate state of the art technology  enable our clients to remain competitive  and facilitate a powerful  cost effective means of conducting business to consumer and business to business e commerce on the internet 
we intend to enhance our product suite through internal development  acquisitions and strategic partnering 
this will include new feature and functionality for most of our enterprise systems  in store systems and analytic applications  complementary products  and the introduction of additional e commerce solutions 
as of december   we had employees on our product development staff  the majority of which were located in scottsdale  arizona 
our product development expenditures in  and were million  million and million  and represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
we currently expect product development expenses in to be between million and million 
our products are designed to address broad  enterprise wide retailing functionality and incorporate the latest design technology 
at the same time  we endeavor to design products that are easily tailored to the specific work flows and business processes of the individual retailer and are readily adapted to changing conditions 
our development strategy utilizes a microsoft development environment for our open client server applications  and an ibm java websphere environment for our ibm as based applications 
the majority of our research and development staff is organized around our three product categories enterprise systems  in store systems and analytic applications 
each of these groups is responsible for the product management process  strategy and release path  delivery  and support of their respective applications 
in addition to these groups  a centralized enterprise group is responsible for maintaining consistency across the product teams with respect to quality assurance  testing processes  documentation  application architecture  and methodology 
our development process is further enhanced by frequent solicitation of client feedback and close contact with clients through our implementation services 
in addition  we have established a product design council that will solicit input from both our internal product specialists and our clients 
we anticipate that certain of our new products and enhancements will be developed  in part  through cost and design sharing partnerships with our leading retail clients 
competition the markets for our software products are highly competitive 
we believe the principal competitive factors are price  feature and functionality  product reputation and referenceable accounts  retail industry expertise  e commerce capabilities and quality of customer support 
we encounter competitive products from a different set of vendors in each of our primary product categories 
our enterprise systems compete with internally developed systems and with third party developers such as island pacific a subsidiary of svi holdings  inc  radius plc  retek  inc  sap ag  and sts systems 
as we continue to develop mms 
com and other e commerce products  we expect to face potential competition from business to business e commerce application providers  including ariba  broadvision  commerce one  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  retek  inc  and microsoft as a result of its recently announced investment in radiant systems  inc in addition  new competitors may enter our markets and offer merchandise management systems that target the retail industry 
the competition for our in store systems is more fragmented than the enterprise systems market 
we compete with major hardware equipment manufacturers such as icl  ncr and ibm  as well as software companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  inc  riva group plc  rtc  and trimax 
in the analytic applications markets  the arthur suite competes primarily with marketmax  inc and ibm s makaro product line 
the retail ideas product competes with products from vendors such as microstrategy 
in the market for consulting services  we have pursued a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as andersen consulting and pricewaterhousecoopers 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as ibm s global services division  also represent potential competition to our consulting services group 
some of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
proprietary rights our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code to our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we license our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of the source code 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we license and integrate technology from third parties in our certain of our software products 
for example  we license the uniface client server application development technology from compuware  inc for use in odbms  certain applications from silvon software  inc for use in retail ideas  and ibm s net 
commerce merchant server software for use in mms 
com 
these third party licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this software  or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products  we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our software products 
these delays  if they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future software solutions infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of e commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  of whom were based in the united states and of whom were based in our international offices 
of the total  were engaged in sales and marketing  were engaged in consulting services  customer support and training  were in product development  and were in administration and finance 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
we have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
our future operating results depend significantly upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will retain our key managerial or technical personnel or that we can attract  assimilate and retain such personnel in the future 
we have at times experienced difficulty recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such difficulties in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel in the future  or if we are unable to assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item properties our corporate offices are located in scottsdale  arizona  where we lease approximately  square feet of a  square foot facility and have a right of offer on the remaining space 
we also use this facility for certain of our sales  marketing  consulting  customer support  training  and product development functions 
our corporate office lease commenced in april at an initial monthly rate of approximately  and extends through march  in connection with the lease  we were granted an option to purchase approximately five acres of real property contiguous to our corporate offices 
this option may be exercised at pre determined prices on or before august provided we maintain certain minimum occupancy levels 
we also lease space for eight regional sales and support offices in major cities across the united states 
we own approximately  square feet of office space in the united kingdom  and lease other office space in london  paris  calgary  toronto  montreal  singapore  melbourne  sidney  tokyo  santiago  rio de janeiro and mexico city 
we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms as needed

civ phx rgs and related cases 
on january   rod bernat  a shareholder of jda software group  inc  filed a securities class action lawsuit against the company  our co chief executive officers  frederick m 
pakis and james d 
armstrong  our former senior vice president of research and development  kenneth desmarchais  and our former chief executive officer  brent w 
lippman  in us district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint filed in the lawsuit alleges that during the alleged class period  january  through january   we misrepresented our business  financial statements and business prospects to investors 
the complaint further alleges that certain of our officers sold significant quantities of our common stock during the class period while the market price of the common stock was artificially inflated by the alleged misrepresentations 
the plaintiffs seek designation of the action as a class action and damages for violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder by the securities and exchange commission sec

bloukos  gwen werboski  elmer s 
martin  linda may  ivan sommer  david hesrick and michael j 
corn all purporting to act on behalf of the same class of shareholders for the same class period  making substantially similar allegations 
these actions were consolidated into one action by an order of the us district court 
pursuant to the court s order  plaintiffs filed a consolidated and amended class action complaint which supercedes their prior complaints 
the consolidated and amended class action complaint alleges a new class period of december  through july   and omits allegations that we misrepresented our financial statements 
plaintiffs also filed a new class action complaint that attempts to allege claims under sections  a and of the securities act of on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock issued pursuant to our secondary public offering on may  we have filed motions to dismiss the consolidated and amended class action complaint and the class action complaint and a motion to strike the class action complaint 
these motions are fully briefed and under submission with the us district court 
we anticipate that the court will set the motions for hearing but it has not done so as of this time 
management believes that the actions are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously 
we are also involved in other legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
although there can be no assurance  management does not believe that the disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows

factors such as future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
further  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price for many high technology companies and which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations  as well as the general economic  market and political conditions both domestically and internationally  including recessions or military conflicts  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of software solutions designed specifically to address the supply chain management  business process  analytic application and e commerce requirements of the retail industry 
our products link point of sale level information with the centralized merchandising  planning and financial functions that ultimately affect decisions with suppliers and vendors 
we conduct business in five geographic regions that have separate management teams and reporting infrastructures the united states  emea europe  middle east and africa  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
similar products and services are offered in each geographical region and local management is evaluated primarily based on total revenues and operating income 
identifiable assets are also managed by geographical region 
the geographic distribution of our revenues and identifiable assets for the three year period ended december  is as follows revenues united states    emea    asia pacific    canada    latin america    total international    sales and transfers between regions    total revenues    identifiable assets united states    emea    asia pacific    canada    latin america   total international    total revenues    no customer accounted for more than of our revenues during the three years ended december  we classify our products and services into three primary product categories enterprise systems which are corporate level merchandise management systems that gather and distribute data throughout an organization to support the retail process and provide decision support for inventory control  cost and price management  purchase order management  automated replenishment  merchandise planning and allocation  in store systems that provide point of sale and back office applications which enable a retailer to capture  analyze  and transmit customer demographic and other operational information to corporate level merchandise management systems  and analytic applications that provide a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing business results and trends  monitoring strategic plans and enabling tactical decisions 
a summary of the revenues and operating income loss attributable to each of these product categories for the three years ended december  is as follows revenues enterprise systems    in store systems    analytic applications    operating income loss enterprise systems    in store systems    analytic applications   other    the operating income loss shown for enterprise systems  in store systems and analytic applications include allocations for occupancy costs  depreciation expense  and amortization of related intangibles

see note to consolidated financial statements we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services relating to our ibm as based merchandise management system mms 
total revenues from mms are included in the enterprise systems product category and represented of our total revenues during as compared with in and in although we expect mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of reduced demand for mms and or increased revenues attributable to our other product lines 
software license revenues and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues represented and  respectively  of our total revenues during  as compared with and  respectively in and and  respectively  in the revenue mix for was primarily affected by lower than anticipated software license revenues in our international markets 
the revenue mix was impacted by a downturn in demand for domestic software licenses 
we believe that sales of our enterprise systems and in store systems were affected during by deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality  and in the case of odbms  a limited number of referenceable implementations 
although we expect sequential increases in software license revenues throughout  we remain cautious about our expectations for the first half of as we believe normal selling cycles are just now beginning to resume 
the following table sets forth a quarterly comparison of  and domestic and international software license revenues change change quarter ended domestic international domestic vs

international vs 
march      june      september      december      software license revenues in our enterprise systems business unit decreased in compared to  and includes declines in both our mms and odbms products 
we believe the mms decline results from deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change as ibm as based products are one of the favored operating platform in the retail industry 
in addition  although sales of our odbms product have shown some improvement during the last six months of  overall sales of the odbms product have historically failed to meet our expectations 
we also believe that sales of odbms have been affected by a significant drop off in demand related to the millennium change  together with external and internal marketing issues  increased competition  and a limited number of referenceable implementations 
as we believe is typical with client server products that are highly complex and sophisticated  we have detected and have attempted to address certain design and stability problems in early versions of our odbms product 
since implementation of odbms generally involves customer specific customization and integration with a variety of hardware and software systems developed by third parties  each version of the product may contain undetected errors when first released 
we have only discovered and evaluated certain of these problems after the odbms product has been implemented and used by our clients with live data over time  with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
software license revenues in our analytic applications business unit increased in compared to  primarily as a result of additional software license revenues from the arthur retail business unit that we acquired in june software license revenues in our in store systems business unit decreased in compared to we believe the decline in demand for our in store systems results from deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality 
to address increased competition in this business segment  we have reorganized our sales force and refocused some of our research and development investment to new feature and functionality 
we cannot guarantee that these actions will increase the demand for our in store systems and any failure to do so could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our service business continues to be an important source of operating income and an important competitive strength as we position ourselves as a total solution provider for retailers 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are derived from a range of services  the demand for which stems primarily from sales of our software products 
these services include system design and implementation and  to a lesser extent  software maintenance  support and training 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are generally more predictable but generate significantly lower gross margins than software revenues and are to a significant extent dependent upon new software license sales 
although consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased in compared to  we expect future consulting  maintenance and other services to decrease until we begin to experience an increased demand in our software license sales 
we have pursued a strategy of addressing international markets by developing localized versions of our products and establishing international subsidiaries with direct sales and consulting capabilities 
to the extent our international operations expand or represent an increasing percentage of our overall business  we would expect that an increasing portion of our international software license revenues and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues would be denominated in foreign currencies 
this increase will subject us to additional risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  our operations have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  if our international operations expand  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding or reducing exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting our earnings 
we had net receivables of million  or days sales outstanding dsos at december   compared to million  or dsos at december  this improvement results from the tighter credit policies we implemented during and reflects our increased focus on client satisfaction 
recent developments we announced the commercial release of our next generation odbms open client server solution  version  in january this new version of odbms operates on the oracle relational database management system and provides expanded retail specific functionality and new modules for expert pricing  vendor submissions  rebate management and a business process level online help system 
in addition  retailers are provided improved security  international functionality and user interfaces  together with enhanced batch processing  online response time and database management performance 
during the first quarter of we reduced our worldwide staff by approximately employees  or  in order to stabilize service margins  optimize our labor resources in certain geographical regions  and to free up funds for investment in staff that support higher growth product lines  including the arthur suite and our e commerce initiatives 
this action will result in a charge of approximately  during the first quarter of on february   we signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets of intactix international  inc intactix  for million in cash  and assumed certain trade and other liabilities and specific acquisition related liabilities for consulting and development commitments under assumed contracts 
intactix is a leading provider of space management solutions for the retail industry and consumer product goods manufacturers 
the intactix products provide planogramming tools that allow users to build  analyze and distribute graphical diagrams for space management  store layout planning and shelf assortment analysis 
we will introduce variations of the intactix products for use with the arthur suite and continue to market the other intactix space management solutions including pro space  a next generation planogramming application  intercept  a windows based space management application  autopilot  a space management automation tool  interrange  an assortment analysis and production tool  and pro floor  a top down retail floor planning tool 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operating results of intactix will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of closing 
the acquisition is subject to the approval of certain governmental regulatory agencies and other standard conditions  and is expected to close in early april results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and certain gross margin data expressed as a percentage of software license or consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  as appropriate year ended december  revenues software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services total revenues costs and expenses software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services product development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles purchased in process research and development restructuring and asset disposition charge total costs and expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income loss gross margin on software licenses gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services total gross profit year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in revenues consist of software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services which represented and  respectively  of total revenues during  as compared with and  respectively in the revenue mix was impacted by a downturn in demand for domestic software licenses 
software licenses 
software license revenues for were million  a decrease of from the million reported in domestic software license revenues decreased in compared to  which was offset in part by a increase in international software license revenues 
the international results include increases in each of the emea  asia pacific and latin american regions and a decrease in canada 
on a product line basis  analytic applications software license revenues increased by in compared to primarily as a result of additional software license revenues from the arthur retail business unit that we acquired in june software license revenues decreased in both our enterprise systems and in store systems business units in compared to we believe that sales in these business units have been affected by deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality  and in the case of the odbms product  a limited number of referenceable implementations

although we expect sequential increases in software license revenues throughout  we remain cautious about our expectations for the first half of as we believe normal selling cycles are just now beginning to resume 
consulting  maintenance and other services 
consulting  maintenance and other services for were million  an increase of over the million reported in this entire increase occurred in our domestic markets as international consulting  maintenance and other services revenues were flat in compared to because consulting  maintenance and other services revenues stem primarily from sales of our software products  we expect future consulting  maintenance and other services revenues to decrease until we begin to experience an increased demand in our software license sales 
cost of revenues cost of software license revenues was million  or of software license revenues in both years 
consulting  maintenance and other services costs for were million  and increase of over the million reported in we reduced the headcount in our consulting  maintenance and other services organization by during  and as of december  there were employees involved in these functions worldwide 
during the first quarter of we eliminated approximately implementation staff positions in the united states  canada and emea and transferred other employees to product development positions to reflect the reduced levels of demand in these geographic areas 
we expect only modest growth  if any  in the overall size of our service organization during we will continue to adjust the size and composition of the workforce in our service organization to match the different geographical demand cycles 
gross profit gross profit for was million  a decrease of from the million reported in gross profit  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease results primarily from the higher mix of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues during our service margins increased from in to in this improvement reflects the favorable impact of increases in our maintenance base  both from the arthur retail acquisition and core jda products  higher average billing rates in our consulting practice  and the elimination of outside contractors in europe 
the improvement in service margins was partially offset in by an increase in non billable hours and decreased utilization in our consulting services group  the transition costs associated with the centralization of global support in our corporate office and increased training costs 
during the first quarter of we eliminated approximately implementation staff positions in the united states  canada and emea and transferred other employees to product development positions to reflect the reduced levels of demand in these geographical areas 
we believe our service margins will be in the to range in operating expenses product development 
product development expenses for were million  a increase over the million reported in product development expense as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in this increase results primarily from continuing development activities associated with odbms  including the release of version  new product initiatives including the next versions of the arthur suite  e commerce products such as mms 
com and the recently announced internet portals  and experimental work with other intranet  extranet and internet business solutions that integrate industry standard e commerce software into current and future e commerce products 
we increased our product development staff by approximately during and as of december   there were employees involved in the product development function 
during the first quarter of  we re deployed or eliminated approximately client server development positions 
we anticipate our quarterly investment in research and development in to be in the million to million range 
we believe our current process of developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  a increase over the million reported in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in this increase results primarily from the incremental costs of the arthur retail business unit and the initial sales and marketing cost incurred in connection with the establishment of business operations in japan 
our worldwide sales and marketing staff decreased during and as of december  there were employees involved in this function 
during  we will continue to realign our sales force to match the demand for our various products and among the geographic regions in which we operate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for were million  a increase over the million reported in general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in both years 
the increase in total expense results primarily from an increase in bad debt reserves  additional administrative personnel in our domestic and international operations  depreciation on purchases of property and equipment related to our expansion  duplicate rent and other non recurring charges of approximately  related to the consolidation and relocation of our corporate offices  and the incremental costs of the arthur retail business unit 
during the first quarter of we eliminated approximately administrative positions 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of amortization on goodwill and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition of the arthur retail business unit in june restructuring and asset disposition charge 
we recorded a million restructuring and asset disposition charge during the first quarter of the restructuring initiatives involved a workforce reduction of over full time employees in the united states and europe million  the closure of three unprofitable locations in germany  france and south africa  the disposal of property and equipment related to the closure of these locations and the consolidation of our corporate operations into one facility  and the release of over subcontractors worldwide 
all workforce reductions included in the restructuring charge were made on or before march  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  partially offset by reductions for research and development expense tax credits 
from time to time  we may be subject to audit by federal  state and or foreign taxing authorities 
we are currently undergoing an audit of our fiscal and federal income tax returns 
in connection with the audit  we have received proposed adjustments from the irs reducing our and research and development expense tax credits 
we and our tax advisors disagree with the adjustments proposed by the irs and intend to vigorously contest them 
accordingly  we are unable to determine the financial impact of the audit at this time 
however  we do not believe that the irs adjustments  even as currently proposed  would have a material impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in revenues consist of software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services  which represented and  respectively  of total revenues during  and and  respectively in the decrease in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from a decrease in international software license revenues between years 
software licenses 
software license revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in domestic software license revenues increased in compared to due to increased sales of the mms  win dss  retailideas and wcc product lines  and incremental sales of the arthur suite 
international software license revenues decreased in compared to as a result of the elongation of international sales cycles  deferred purchasing decisions for merchandising systems  weakening international economies and increased competition 
the international results for were also impacted by internal execution issues surrounding the strategic realignment of our international sales management group 
this realignment began during the second quarter of and involved the movement of certain key employees from the european and latin american regions to other roles  specifically the positions of senior vice president  international and senior vice president and managing director  jda arthur 
we did not fill the vacated positions of vice president latin america until september and the vice president emea until mid november however  the new vice president emea submitted his resignation effective march  we promoted from within our emea organization to fill the vacant position 
consulting  maintenance and other services 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for were million  an increase of over the reported in this increase resulted from the higher volume of software license sales  including client server products that require longer implementation cycles  improved utilization  higher average billing rates and the incremental consulting and maintenance revenues related to the arthur suite 
domestic and international consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased and  respectively in compared to cost of revenues cost of software license revenues was million in as compared to million in cost of software licenses represented and of software license revenues in and  respectively 
the increase reflects the higher costs associated with increased sales of products during that incorporate software technology licensed from third party suppliers 
consulting  maintenance and other services costs for were million  an increase of over the million reported in we expanded our consulting and customer support organizations during as a result  and in anticipation  of continued increased sales of new software licenses and increased demand from the existing client base for additional support and professional services 
we increased the number of personnel in our consulting  maintenance and other services organization by in compared to  and as of december   there were employees involved in these functions worldwide 
in addition  we utilized a significant number of subcontractors in europe during to provide timely implementation work 
gross profit gross profit for was million  an increase of over the million reported in gross profit  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues during gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased between years  however  from in to in this improvement reflects the favorable impact of increases in our maintenance base  both from the arthur retail acquisition and core jda products  and improved utilization and higher average billing rates in our consulting practice

we believes our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility  and accordingly  no costs have been capitalized 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  an increase of over the million reported in sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased between years from in to in we increased our sales and marketing staff by between years and as of december   there were nearly employees involved in this function

amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of amortization on goodwill and other intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition of arthur retail in june purchased in process research and development 
we recorded a one time charge of million in for in process research and development acquired in connection with the purchase of arthur retail and recorded a related tax benefit of million

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  partially offset by reductions for research and development expense tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and public sales of equity securities 
we had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  an increase of million from the million reported at december  we also had million in marketable securities at december   a decrease of million from the million reported at december  operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided from operating activities in resulted primarily from million of depreciation and amortization  million in provision for doubtful accounts  and a million decrease in accounts receivable  offset in part by a million increase in income tax receivable and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash provided from operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of million  excluding the one time charge for purchased in process research and development and related tax benefit  million of depreciation and amortization  and an increase of million in deferred revenue  offset in part by a million increase in accounts receivable 
cash provided from operating activities in resulted primarily from net income of million  million in depreciation and amortization  million in provision for doubtful accounts  and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset in part by a million increase in accounts receivable 
we had net accounts receivable of million  or days sales outstanding dsos at december   compared to million  or dsos at december  dsos may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  contractual payment terms  the underlying mix of products and services  and the geographic concentration of revenues 
investing activities utilized cash of  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the activity includes million in capital expenditures  including over million related to our corporate office relocation  offset in part by million in proceeds from disposal of property and equipment and the net maturity of million of marketable securities

the activity includes million in capital expenditures and an initial payment of million for the purchase of liocs 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the activity in all periods includes proceeds from the issuance of common stock and related tax benefits under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
in addition  the activity includes net proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of common stock in a secondary public offering 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign operations had the effect of reducing cash by   and  in  and  respectively 
we did not enter into any foreign exchange contracts or engage in similar hedging strategies during the three year period ended december  on february   we signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets of intactix for million in cash  and assume certain trade and other liabilities and specific acquisition related liabilities for consulting and development commitments under assumed contracts 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operating results of intactix will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of closing 
the acquisition is subject to the approval of certain governmental regulatory agencies and other standard conditions  and is expected to close in early april we expect to incur between million and million in restructuring costs to integrate our two businesses and take advantage of the operational synergies 
we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in addition  any material acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies could require that we obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we maintain a million revolving line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is collateralized by property and equipment  receivables  and intangibles  accrues interest at the bank s reference rate which approximates prime less 
percentage points  and requires that we maintain certain current ratios and tangible net worth 
the line of credit matures on july  there were no amounts outstanding on the line of credit at december  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  available borrowings under the bank line of credit and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance no significant year compliance issues have been reported on our software products since the millennium changeover 
we are aware  however  that some of our customers may have been running earlier versions of our software products that were not year compliant ie  able to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
we contacted and encouraged such customers to migrate to current product versions 
moreover  our products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving complicated software products developed by other vendors 
the most probable worst case scenario is that we may yet in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products  custom modifications made by us or third parties to our products  or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
we have not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date alleging that our products or services are not year compliant 
however  we are from time to time involved in payment disputes and may be subject to year counter claims 
there can be no assurance that we will not in the future be required to defend our products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based upon year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability we may incur for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to date  we have not encountered any year related problems with our financial institutions  investment advisors or suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by us  nor others with whom we transact business on a worldwide basis 
further  we have not encountered any year related problems with our internal systems 
all of our financial and operational systems were available over the millennium changeover and the integrity of the historical information contained within those systems has not been affected 
we incurred less than  on our year compliance effort 
we believe there was a slowing of demand in for our enterprise systems and in store systems due  in part  to deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change 
we continue to be cautious about our near term expectations for software licenses  and any resultant service revenues  due to the impact that the year distraction may have had on the length and predictability of our selling cycles 
although we expect sequential increases in software license revenues throughout  we remain cautious about our expectations for the first half of as we believe normal selling cycles are just now beginning to resume 
to the extent we encounter any significant continuing delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase our products or services  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
euro currency in january  a new currency called the ecu or the euro was introduced in participating european economic and monetary union emu countries 
during  all participating emu countries are expected to be operating with the euro as their single currency 
during the next two years  business in participating emu countries will be conducted in both the existing national currency and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in these emu member countries will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we currently offer software products that are designed to be euro currency enabled  and we believe these products can be modified to accommodate any required euro currency changes 
there can be no assurance  however  that our products will contain all the necessary changes or meet all the euro currency requirements 
if our software products do not meet all the euro currency requirements  our business  operating results  and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted 
we have not had and do not expect a material impact on our results of operations from foreign currency gains or losses as a result of a transition to the euro as the functional currency for our subsidiaries based in emu countries 
certain risks our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
many factors may cause these fluctuations  including demand for our software products and services  the size and timing of individual orders  particularly with respect to our larger customers  the lengthening of our sales cycle  competitive pricing pressures  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  changes in the mix of software license revenues  changes in the mix of software license revenues compared to consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  the timing of new software product introductions and enhancements to our software products or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new software products  technological changes in platforms supporting our software products  changes in our operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  our ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  employee hiring and retention  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  expansion of international operations  changes in our strategies  and general industry and economic conditions 
in addition  we believe we have experienced and are continuing to experience a decline in overall demand for our enterprise systems and in store systems 
in particular  although sales of our odbms product have shown some improvement during the last six months of  overall sales of the odbms product have historically failed to meet our expectations 
we believe that sales of odbms have been affected by a significant drop off in demand related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  increased competition  a limited number of referenceable implementations  and certain design and stability issues in earlier versions of the odbms product 
we also believe that the decline in demand for our in store systems products have been affected by deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change  longer sales cycles  increased competition and or lack of desired feature and functionality 
we have addressed increased competition in this business unit by reorganizing our sales force and refocusing some of our research and development investment into new feature and functionality 
we cannot guarantee that these actions will increase the demand for this product line and any failure to do so could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
we believe that the prevailing business reasons still exist for purchasing merchandising systems and the other software products that we offer still exist 
you should not rely on the current performance or historic growth rates for our enterprise systems  in store systems  and analytic applications as an indication of their future performance 
because the gross margin on software licenses is significantly greater than the gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services  our combined gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter  and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix and service utilization rates 
since our consulting  maintenance and other service revenues are to a significant extent dependent upon new software license sales  we expect future consulting  maintenance and other service revenues to decrease until we begin to experience an increased demand in our software license sales 
in the event software license revenues fail to meet our expectations or there is a decline in demand  our consulting  maintenance and other services revenues would be adversely impacted 
we typically ship our software products when contracts are signed 
consequently  our software license backlog at the beginning of any quarter has represented only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
as a result  software license revenues in any quarter depend in large part upon contracts signed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
it is therefore difficult for us to predict revenues 
because of the timing of our sales  we typically recognize a substantial amount of our software license revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter  and we generally derive a significant portion of our quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
it is difficult to forecast the timing of large individual software license sales with certainty 
accordingly  large individual sales have sometimes occurred in quarters subsequent to when we anticipated 
we expect that the foregoing trends will continue 
if we receive any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or we are unable to conclude license negotiations by the end of a fiscal quarter  our operating results may be lower than anticipated 
in addition  any weakening or uncertainty in international economies may make it more difficult for us to predict quarterly results in the future  and could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
our expense levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
since software license sales are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting  implementation and support services  the size of services organization must be managed to meet our anticipated software license revenues 
as a result  we hire and train service personnel and incur research and development costs in advance of anticipated software license revenues 
if software revenues fall short of our expectations  or if we are unable to fully utilize our service personnel  our operating results are likely to decline because a significant portion of our expenses cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we believe there was a slowing in demand in for our enterprise systems and in store systems due  in part  to deferred purchasing decisions related to the millenium change 
we continue to be cautious about our near term expectations for software licenses  and any resultant services revenues due  in part  to the impact that the year distraction may have had on the length and predictability of selling cycles 
although we expect sequential increases in software license revenues throughout  we remain cautious about our expectations for the first half of as we believe normal selling cycles are just now beginning to resume 
based on all of the foregoing  we believe that future revenues  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
furthermore  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that happens  or if adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or generally  the price of our common stock may decline 
we are dependent upon the retail industry 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues to date from the license of software products and the performance of related services to the retail industry 
our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the license of our software products generally involves a large capital expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or downturns in the retail industry 
such downturns may cause customers to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditure for information management systems and software products 
in addition  e commerce on the internet is dramatically impacting the retail industry 
the traditional brick and mortar retailers that we have historically served now face substantial competition from internet based retailers that may negatively impact their ability to purchase our products 
we announced the commercial availability of the mms 
com e commerce product during the third quarter of and to date there have only been limited sales of this product 
in addition  we have only recently announced our intentions to develop a series of business to business e commerce solutions 
these solutions include internet portals which are web based interfaces that provide retailers with a one stop destination for internal users  customers and suppliers to access multiple information sources and applications 
the market for e commerce products is new and quickly evolving 
we expect significant growth in e commerce over the internet  however  we are unable to predict the full impact this emerging form of commerce will have on the traditional brick and mortar retail operations we have historically served 
if the market for our mms 
com product or other future web enabled products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if our e commerce products are not accepted in the marketplace  our business  operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
we also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating and that the industry is from time to time subject to increased competition and weakening economic conditions that could negatively impact the industry  our customers ability to pay for our products and services and which have and could potentially lead to an increased number of bankruptcy filings 
such consolidation and weakening economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to manage our growth 
our business grew rapidly from to  with revenues increasing from million in  to million in and to million in this expansion resulted in substantial growth in our number of employees  the scope of our operating systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers during these periods 
the rapid growth placed a significant strain on our management and operations 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force  in particular our direct sales force and consulting services organization  and to deal effectively with third party systems integrators and consultants 
we reorganized our senior management in january by business units enterprise systems  in store systems and analytic applications and implemented a matrix organization that provides each of our geographic regions the united states  emea  asia pacific  canada and latin america with full responsibility for direct sales  consulting services and operations 
certain members of our executive management team have served in their current positions for less than two years 
our future growth and success depends in large part upon the ability of our executive management team to effectively manage expansion of our operations 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our recent or any future growth  and any failure to do so would negatively effect our business  operating results and financial condition 
ability to attract and retain skilled personnel is important to our growth 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate skilled personnel  including sales and marketing representatives  qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development  and consulting personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and services 
the market for such individuals is intensely competitive  particularly in international markets 
in this regard  we dramatically increased the number of associates involved in these functions during and in connection with the continuing development and rollout of our client server products  and to support further development and implementation of mms 
given the critical roles of our sales  product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel in our sales  product development or consulting staffs would hurt us 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  or be able to assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses 
we will continue to adjust the size and composition of the workforce in our services organization to match the different product and geographic demand cycles 
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have only deployed certain of our software products on a limited basis 
certain of our software products  including odbms  win dss  retail ideas  and the arthur suite  which are designed for open  client server environments  have been commercially released within the last five years 
the market for these products is continually evolving  and we believe that retailers may be more cautious than other businesses in adopting client server technologies 
consequently  we cannot predict the growth rate  if any  and size of the market for our client server products or that this market will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement our client server products  or may not purchase our products for a variety of reasons  including their inability to obtain hardware  software  networking infrastructure  or sufficient internal staff required to implement  operate and maintain an open  client server solution  the generally longer time periods and greater cost required to implement such products as compared to ibm as based products  and limited implementation experience with such products or third party implementation providers 
in addition  we must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market our client server products  including limited experience of our sales and consulting personnel in the client server market and a limited market size 
if the market for our client server products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if our products are not accepted in the marketplace or are technically flawed  our business  operating results and financial condition will decline 
although recent sales of our odbms product have shown some improvement during the last six months of  overall sales of the odbms product have historically failed to meet our expectations 
we believe that sales of odbms have been affected by a significant drop off in demand related to the millenium change  external and internal marketing issues  increased competition  a limited number of referenceable implementations  and certain design and stability issues in earlier versions of the odbms product 
since implementation of odbms generally involves customer specific customization and integration with a variety of hardware and software systems developed by third parties  each version of the product may contain undetected errors when first released 
we have only discovered and evaluated certain of these problems after the odbms product has been implemented and used by our clients with live data over time  with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
we announced the commercial availability of the mms 
com e commerce product during the third quarter of and to date there have only been limited sales of this product 
in addition  we have only recently announced our intentions to develop a series of business to business e commerce solutions 
these solutions include internet portals which are web based interfaces that provide retailers with a one stop destination for internal users  customers and suppliers to access multiple information sources and applications 
the market for e commerce products is new and quickly evolving 
we expect significant growth in e commerce over the internet  however  we are unable to predict the full impact this emerging form of commerce will have on the traditional brick and mortar retail operations historically served by our other software products 
if the market for our mms 
com product or other future web enabled products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if our e commerce products are not accepted in the marketplace  our business  operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of the mms product 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services related to mms 
mms revenues are partially dependent on the continued vitality in and support of the ibm as platform  which we believe is a favored platform in the retail industry 
although we expect mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of reduced demand for mms and or increased revenues attributable to our other product lines 
the lifecycle of the mms product line is difficult to estimate due largely to the potential effect of new products  applications and product enhancements  including our own changes in the retail industry and future competition 
any decline in mms revenues  as a result of competition  technological change  a decline in the market for or support of the ibm as platform  or other factors  which are not offset by increases in revenues from other products  will cause our business  operating results and financial condition to decline 
we cannot guarantee that prospective purchasers of our ibm as based products will respond favorably to our future or enhanced software products or that we will continue to be successful in selling our software products or services in the ibm as market 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
our international revenues represented of total revenues in as compared with and and  respectively 
although  we expect international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future  we remain cautious about our expectations regarding international operations in the near term 
if our international operations grow  we must recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries we have or will establish offices 
our entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels as well as the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software 
international introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of our new offices typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire or that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations in a timely manner which could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international business operations are subject to risks associated with international activities  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially negative tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and general economic conditions in international markets 
in addition  consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower billing rates and or higher costs in certain of our international markets 
accordingly  any significant growth in our international operations may result in further declines in gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services 
we expect that an increasing portion of our international software license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
we cannot guarantee that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which would reduce our earnings 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our software products are highly competitive 
we believe the principal competitive factors are price  feature and functionality  product reputation and referenceable accounts  retail industry expertise  e commerce capabilities and quality of customer support 
we encounter competitive products from a different set of vendors in each of our primary product categories 
our enterprise systems compete with internally developed systems and with third party developers such as island pacific a subsidiary of svi holdings  inc  radius plc  retek  inc  sap ag  and sts systems 
as we continue to develop mms 
com and other e commerce products  we expect to face potential competition from business to business e commerce application providers  including ariba  broadvision  commerce one  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  retek  inc  and microsoft as a result of its recently announced investment in radiant systems  inc in addition  new competitors may enter our markets and offer merchandise management systems that target the retail industry 
the competition for our in store systems is more fragmented than the enterprise systems market 
we compete with major hardware equipment manufacturers such as icl  ncr and ibm  as well as software companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  inc  riva group plc  rtc  and trimax 
in the analytic applications markets  the arthur suite competes primarily with marketmax  inc and ibm s makaro product line 
the retail ideas product competes with products from vendors such as microstrategy 
in the market for consulting services  we have pursued a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as andersen consulting and pricewaterhousecoopers 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as ibm s global services division  also represent potential competition to our consulting services group 
some of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there are risks associated with our strategic relationships 
we have from time to time established  or attempted to establish  formal and informal relationships with other companies  including ibm  microsoft  compuware  inc and silvon  inc  to collaborate in areas such as product development  marketing and distribution 
the maintenance of these relationships and the development of other similar relationships is a meaningful part of our business strategy 
currently  our relationships with ibm and microsoft are cooperative  and there is no written agreement defining the parties obligations 
we cannot assure you that our current informal relationships with ibm  microsoft or other companies will be beneficial to us  that such relationships can be maintained  or that we will be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future 
implementation of our products is a lengthy process  our fixed price service contracts may result in losses 
our software products are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of our software is a complex  lengthy process and commitment of resources by our clients is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
we believe that the complicated nature and increased flexibility of the client server versions of our products may contribute to the length of the implementation process 
delays in the implementations of any of our software products  whether by us or our business partners  may result in client dissatisfaction or damage to our reputation and a decline in our business  operating results and financial condition 
we offer a combination of software products  implementation and support services to our customers 
typically  we enter into service agreements with our customers that provide for consulting and implementation services on a time and expenses basis 
certain clients have asked for  and we have from time to time entered into  fixed price service contracts 
these contracts specify certain milestones to be met regardless of our actual costs incurred in fulfilling our obligations 
we believe that fixed price service contracts may increasingly be offered by our competitors to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as a result  we may enter into more fixed price contracts in the future 
we cannot guarantee we can successfully complete these contracts on budget  and our inability to do so could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive 
the computer software industry and the business to business e commerce market for our products is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements  frequent product introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products and services obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  our position in our existing markets  or other markets that we may enter  could be eroded rapidly by technological advancements not adopted by us  or through our failure to develop products and services and maintain strategic relationships that are compatible with industry standards 
the lifecycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
the products must keep pace with technological developments  conform to evolving industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated client needs 
we believe that we must continue to respond quickly to the retailers needs for broad functionality and multi platform support and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
we may experience future difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  or that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business  operating results and financial condition would be negatively impacted 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code to our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we license our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of the source code 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
we license and integrate technology from third parties in our certain of our software products 
for example  we license the uniface client server application development technology from compuware  inc for use in odbms  certain applications from silvon software  inc for use in retail ideas  and ibm s net 
commerce merchant server software for use in mms 
com 
these third party licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this software  or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products  we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our software products 
these delays  if they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that we or our current or potential future software solutions infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of e commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there are risks related to product defects  product liability  and integration difficulties 
our software products are highly complex and sophisticated 
as a result  they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our products may involve customer specific customization by us or third parties  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as our client server and e commerce software products  to contain undetected errors when first released 
they are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  we have in the past discovered defects or errors in our products or custom modifications only after our software products have been used by many clients 
in addition  our clients may occasionally experience difficulties integrating our products with other hardware or software in their environment that are unrelated to defects in our products 
such defects  errors or difficulties may cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with our products 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive and that speed to market is critical to our success 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our current products and develop new products that achieve market acceptance 
these new products must incorporate state of the art technology  enable our clients to remain competitive  and facilitate a powerful  cost effective means of conducting business to consumer and business to business e commerce on the internet 
if clients experience significant problems with implementation of our products or are otherwise dissatisfied with their functionality or performance or if they fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be negatively impacted 
our products are typically used by our clients to perform mission critical functions 
as a result  design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems arising from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our clients 
prior to  we did not maintain product liability insurance 
our license agreements with our clients typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the associated liability and costs 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance depends in large part on the continued performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of james d 
armstrong our chief executive officer 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of mr 
armstrong or other key executive officers or employees could negatively affect our financial performance 
we may make acquisitions in the future 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies  including those which are significant in size and scope 
on february   we signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets of intactix for million in cash  and assume certain trade and other liabilities and specific acquisition related liabilities for consulting and development commitments under assumed contracts 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the operating results of intactix will be included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of closing 
the acquisition is subject to the approval of certain governmental regulatory agencies and other standard conditions  and is expected to close in early april acquisitions such as intactix or others we may pursue involve a number of special risks 
those risks include the inability to obtain  or meet conditions imposed for  governmental approvals for the acquisition  diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  costs related to the acquisition and the integration of the acquired businesses  products  technologies and employees into our business and product offerings 
achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend  in part  upon whether integration of the acquired business  products  technology  or employees is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner  and there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated  and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the inability of management to successfully integrate any acquisition that we may pursue  and any related diversion of management s attention  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  there can be no assurance that any products acquired will gain acceptance in our markets  or that we will be able to penetrate new markets successfully or that we will obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such acquisitions 
any acquisition which we pursue or consummate could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  purchased research and development expense  other acquisition related expenses and the loss of key employees  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
international revenues represented of our total revenues during  as compared with in and in in addition  the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated assets as of december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
we have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such  foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange losses of  in   in  and  in we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and variable and fixed rate obligations of the us government and its agencies  states  municipalities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption other income  net 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million with interest rates generally ranging between and
