item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the dow chemical company and its subsidiaries the company 
this section covers the current performance and outlook of the company and each of its operating segments 
the forward looking statements contained in this section and in other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s operations  markets  products  services  prices and other factors as more fully discussed elsewhere and in filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic  competitive  legal  governmental and technological factors  as well as issues related to year and euro conversion 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company s expectations will be realized 
results of operations dow s sales for were billion  up percent from billion in and down percent from billion in volume improved percent from  more than offsetting a percent decline in selling prices see sales price and volume table below 
the company experienced volume growth throughout the year with demand particularly strong in the performance plastics and plastics segments and  from a geographic standpoint  in europe and asia pacific 
compared with last year  prices were lower in most businesses and geographic areas  as the chemical industry experienced trough level pricing 
sales in the united states accounted for percent of total sales in and  down from percent in sales and other information by operating segment and geographic area are provided in note r to the financial statements 
dow continued to restructure its portfolio in with the announcement of several acquisitions and alliances that are expected to contribute to the company s future earnings growth

dividends the board of directors has announced a quarterly dividend of cents per share  payable april   to stockholders of record on march  this will be the rd consecutive quarterly dividend since dow has maintained or increased the dividend throughout that time 
the company declared dividends of per share in each of the last two years and per share in other matters environmental matters in  dow publicly announced its voluntary global environment  health and safety eh s goals for  consistent with the company s decade long commitment to responsible care 
dow s eh s goals are ambitious performance targets to measure progress toward sustainable development  including targets to reduce chemical emissions  waste and wastewater by percent 
equally aggressive are dow s eh s goals to reduce leaks  spills  fires  explosions  work related injuries and transportation incidents by percent 
dow is on track or ahead of schedule in most of these areas 
more information on dow s eh s policies  systems and performance can be found in dow s public report on the internet at www 
dow 
com 
in addition to these voluntary commitments  dow s global operations are subject to stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation 
dow s environmental responsibilities and potential liabilities receive direct and ongoing scrutiny by management to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations 
dow s environmental management standard ems clearly defines the overall environmental systems  performance objectives and design requirements needed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection  and to comply with these laws and regulations 
it is dow s stated eh s policy that all global operations and products meet dow s ems or their country s laws and regulations whichever is more stringent 
in  dow further enhanced the effectiveness of its ems by integrating it into a company wide management system for eh s  operations and quality including implementation of a new global eh s work process to improve eh s performance and to ensure ongoing compliance worldwide 
in sites in europe and the united states  the company also received third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso to date  five european sites have been iso certified 
in march  three us manufacturing sites and the global headquarters in midland voluntarily participated in a third party responsible care management systems verification msv to ensure that dow has the processes and programs in place to reach the highest standards of eh s excellence worldwide 
dow s msv results can be found on the internet at www

it is dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal incineration means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities 
wastes that are recycled  treated or recovered for energy off site represent less than two percent of the total amount of wastes reported as part of the pollution prevention act 
dow accrues the costs of site remediation for its facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
in the case of a landfill  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the nature of such remediation includes the cleanup of soil contamination and the closure of landfills and other waste management facilities 
the policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
dedicated dow joint ventures provide strategic management to identify cost effective solutions for certain remediation liabilities at dow s us manufacturing locations 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow is named as a potentially responsible party prp under federal or state superfund statutes at approximately sites 
dow readily cooperates in remediation where the company s liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
this approach  coupled with dow s long standing preference for on site waste treatment  has minimized the number of superfund sites in which dow is involved 
because current law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a superfund site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that have also been named prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
management estimated that the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million  which has been accrued 
in addition  receivables of million for probable recoveries from other prps have been recorded related to superfund sites 
in addition to superfund related liability  dow had an accrued liability of million at december  related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the company has not recorded as a receivable any third party recovery related to these sites 
in november  dow filed a lawsuit against several of its insurers seeking recovery of remediation costs at certain current or former dow owned sites 
in total  dow s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of these costs  although the ultimate cost could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of dow management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in year readiness disclosure the company s year yk project  which began in early  was a global effort covering information systems  process control and embedded systems for all of the company s businesses 
the project was designed to address  through use of reasonable commercial efforts  the risk that certain internal or external systems might have inaccurately interpreted dates after december  the project was led by a senior director of information systems who reported to the chief information officer and an executive steering team  and was managed by a global team consisting of technical  functional and business leaders 
since early  the audit committee of the company s board of directors received quarterly reports on the team s plan and progress 
the program included yk remediation of information systems hardware  systems software  telecommunications network infrastructure  business systems  manufacturing process control systems and embedded systems  such as laboratory equipment  air conditioners and elevators 
the company s implementation of enterprise wide financial and operational systems and standardized desktop computing during the last several years facilitated this effort

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional exposure within established limits and policies 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts and over the counter option contracts 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro  deutsche mark  swiss franc and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to the japanese yen and european currencies 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
cracker feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
the risk of these hedging instruments is not material 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation move in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity and earnings of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on the variance covariance statistical model 
the following table is given as an example average daily var at december in millions foreign exchange interest rate equity exposures  net of hedges using a percent confidence level
