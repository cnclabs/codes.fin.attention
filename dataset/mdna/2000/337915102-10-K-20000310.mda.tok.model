net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest and loan fee income on earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the principal source of earnings for the corporation 
throughout this discussion net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest were subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and equity  
table of contents and the growth in earning assets 
the following table shows the allocation to assets  the source of funding and their respective interest spreads

specifically  interest income rose million while interest expense increased million 
interest income was higher than in because average earning assets grew or million 
the increase in average earning assets was mainly attributable to strong loan demand 
additionally  s average earning assets included the results of cobancorp  accounted for as a purchase acquisition  from the acquisition date of may  through december   or approximately seven months compared to a full year in totals prior to may  do not include the results of cobancorp  in accordance with purchase accounting guidelines 
the overall lower interest rate environment in compared with the prior year had the following effect on interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the average yield on earning assets decreased basis points from in to for in summary  higher earning asset volumes outpaced the decline in interest income caused by lower yields on earning assets 
higher interest expense was also volume driven as deposits and other borrowings and certificate of deposits were the main funding sources for the earning asset growth 
the cost of funds for the year as a percentage of average earning assets decreased basis points from in to this year 

table of contents the following table illustrates the specific year over year impact to net interest income based on changes in the rate and volume components of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as discussed previously  the decline in the net interest margin compared to last year was a result of the decline in earning asset yield outpacing the decline in earning asset funding costs

table of contents other income excluding securities gains  other income totaled million in  an increase of million or over  and million or over increases were recorded during in all categories except loan sales and servicing 
a portion of the increases were caused by the application of purchase accounting rules to the may acquisition of cobancorp 
specifically  purchase accounting requires including the results of the acquired company in combined results from the date of acquisition forward

service charges on deposits rose million or compared to last year 
much of this income is based on the number of accounts and customer checking account activity 
as stated throughout this annual report  as a general rule some portion of the increase between and prior balances is due to the may purchase accounting acquisition of cobancorp  inc credit card fees increased million or in a large portion of the increase was a result of increased debit card volume  much of the expansion occurring with signal customers who did not previously have this product 
the remainder of the increase was fee driven as the corporation maintained fee structures consistent with competitors 
other service fees rose million  or compared to last year  major components of this category include certain atm fees  sales commissions on personalized customer checks  and fee income from the sale of official bank checks 
the decline in loan sales and servicing income was a result of fewer sales due to the level of interest rates in the economy 
other operating income  as presented in the table  was up million in part because of higher letter of credit fees  introduction of our new business manager product  and higher commissions on equity and insurance sales 
excluding gains from sales of securities  other income was million and now represents of net revenue compared to last year 
net revenue is defined as net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  plus other income  excluding securities sales gains or losses

note to the consolidated financial statements also discusses merger related expenses in detail and summarizes their effect on other expenses  other income statement categories and the overall earnings of the corporation 
adjusted salaries  wages  pension and benefits totaled million in  a decrease of million or from the corresponding adjusted costs 
the decrease in salaries and wages were attributable to efficiencies gained through the signal acquisition  lower bonus pay  and longer replacement times in filling open positions due to the low unemployment rate in our operating areas 
pension and benefit costs were also reduced by efficiencies realized in the signal merger and longer job replacement times 
adjusted bankcard  loan processing  and other fees decreased million to million in as efficiencies were realized compared to pre merger processing costs 
amortization of intangible expense during was million compared to million in and million in the increase was due to the cobancorp acquisition 
the efficiency ratio for  excluding merger related and other material unusual costs  was compared to in the efficiency ratio includes a million pre tax valuation charge related to residual interest on manufactured housing asset backed securities 
if the residual interest charge had been excluded from the efficiency ratio calculation  the resultant ratio would have been

successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiary banks  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and statement no 
 an amendment of statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these statements provide guidance for determining the allowance for loan loses related to impaired loans and illustrate the required financial statement disclosures for impaired loans 
impaired loans are loans for which current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans must be valued based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows at the loans effective interest rates  at the loans observable market price  or the fair value of the loans collateral 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

consumer installment loans are charged off when they reach days past due 
credit card loans are charged off when they reach days past due

in addition to the impact of the cobancorp acquisition  savings deposits rose primarily in money market type accounts 
the average rate paid on all interest bearing deposits compared to the prior year reflected the overall lower interest rate environment experienced during most of specifically  interest bearing demand deposits yields decreased considerably to  the average yield paid on savings and money market accounts declined basis points to and the average yield paid on cds dropped basis points to

amount maturing in under months  to months  to months  over months  interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy which provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies to trends within the financial markets and within the industry 
the analysis presented below divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion which it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period by a moderate amount 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within days subsequent to year end  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position as illustrated in the following table over days days days days days year total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases       investment securities       federal funds sold   total interest earning assets

changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee of the firstmerit bank board of directors alco oversees financial risk management  establishing broad policies that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in the corporation s operations 
alco monitors firstmerit s interest rates and sets limits on allowable risk annually 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
firstmerit s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on firstmerit s balance sheet consists of mismatches of maturity gaps and indices  and options risk 
maturity gap mismatches result from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
options risk exists in many of firstmerit s retail products such as prepayable mortgage loans and demand deposits 
options risk typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for firstmerit 
index mismatches occur when asset and liability portfolios are tied to different market indices which may not move in tandem as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is monitored using gap analysis  earnings simulation and net present value estimations 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk in the balance sheet at a point in time 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of firstmerit s interest rate risk for earnings simulation for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down basis points

liquidity the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system  along with unused wholesale sources of liquidity and its capital base 
these funds  along with investment securities  provide the ability to meet the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments 
firstmerit bank maintains sufficient liquidity in the form of short term marketable investments with a short term maturity structure  federal home loan bank of cincinnati borrowing capacity  a brokered certificate of deposit cd program  unused federal funds sold capacity and cash flow from loan repayment 
in addition  the banking subsidiary is able to raise significant liquidity in the form of deposits raised through deposit gathering campaigns 
from june through september  in anticipation of rising interest rates  the corporation raised approximately million in two cd special promotions priced at approximately 
in july  the banking subsidiary entered into agreements to issue short and medium term senior notes and long term subordinated notes 
it is anticipated that the banking subsidiary will issue subordinated notes totaling approximately million prior to march  to strengthen capital ratios and to provide an additional funding resource for loan demand 
the maturity range on the subordinated notes is five years or longer and the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time may not exceed billion 
these notes will be offered only to institutional investors 
reliance on borrowed funds increased during the year as average earning assets rose more than average deposits 
in short  strong loan growth required more dependence on borrowed funds 
during the year  the corporation sold  for liquidity purposes  approximately million of fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans 
the loan sales improved liquidity while restructuring the balance sheet to higher yielding assets 

table of contents the liquidity needs of the parent company  primarily cash dividends  the stock repurchase programs and other corporate purposes  are met through cash  short term investments  dividends from the firstmerit bank  and the revolving lines of credit 
the lines of credit are repaid with earnings from the banking subsidiary 
the two line of credit facilities have the following terms the total line of credit is million  the amount outstanding at year end was million  the interest rate at year end was  and the interest rate structure is variable based on one month libor plus basis points  and the total line of credit is million  the amount outstanding at year end was million  the interest rate at year end was  and the variable interest rate structure is based on one month libor plus basis points 
management is not aware of any trend or event  other than noted in this section or in other sections within this report  which would result in  or is reasonably likely to result in  a material increase or decrease in the corporation s liquidity 
regulation and supervision a strict uniform system of capital based regulation of financial institutions became effective on december  under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
at year end  firstmerit and its subsidiaries all exceeded the minimum capital levels of the well capitalized category 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this annual report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement information in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section within this report  which is not historical or factual in nature  and which relates to expectations for future shifts in loan portfolio to consumer and commercial loans  increase in core deposits base  allowance for loan losses  demands for firstmerit services and products  future services and products to be offered  increased numbers of customers  and like items  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following factors are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the banking industry  the regulatory environment  rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards  competitive factors  including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions  new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures  and like items 

table of contents firstmerit cautions that any forward looking statements contained in this report  in a report incorporated by reference to this report  or made by management of firstmerit in this report  in other reports and filings  in press releases and in oral statements  involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based upon the factors listed above and like items 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied  and therefore the forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
firstmerit may from time to time issue other forward looking statements 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
any of a company s hardware  date driven automated equipment  or computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this faulty recognition could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
to ensure the year issue was properly addressed significant resources were used 
consulting and contract programming resources supplemented internal staff and provided specialized expertise where necessary 
firstmerit used newly acquired software tools and enhanced procedures to assist in code remediation  testing  and controlling the numerous software changes 
staff throughout the organization reviewed testing results 
coordination with major business partners was also performed 
the corporation first contracted the services of an application development  outsourcing and integration services firm  to perform an enterprise wide business unit risk assessment of year issues 
by year end  the firm had completed the enterprise wide business unit risk assessment for the corporation which included formal communications with all significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those third parties failure to address their own year issues 
during  the corporation contracted with a different outside consulting firm to provide an independent assessment of our year efforts 
results were reported to the corporation s board of directors in november management and the board of directors agreed with the findings and overall view that the project was on track 
the issues identified by the independent consultants were already in the process of being addressed 
additionally  as a nationally chartered bank  the corporation s banking subsidiary falls under the regulatory guidelines published by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
periodic audits of the corporation s year activities are performed by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ as well as the federal reserve bank 
as a sign of confidence regarding the corporation s year efforts  the announcement was made in april that some branches would be open on january  firstmerit was the first bank in any of our markets to make such an announcement 
during  the corporation completed extensive year testing  contingency planning and year end preparation 
the ffiec considers five general year phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the five phases are explained as follows along with corporation s status at december  awareness the awareness phase defines the year problem  gains executive level support and establishes an overall strategy 
the corporation began working on the year issue in with identification of major vendors and their compliance status 
executive management was proactive in the management of the project and contracted with consultants to assist in performing the assessment and formulating a strategy 
the awareness phase was expanded to include a widespread customer awareness program to help educate customers of the year issue and allow monitoring of firstmerit s progress 
assessment the assessment phase defines the size and complexity of the problem and the magnitude of the effort needed to address year issues 
firstmerit completed the assessment phase for all mainframe and microcomputer systems during the first quarter of firstmerit has mainframe applications of which are considered mission critical 
the majority of the applications are vendor packages 
significant microcomputer software and hardware upgrades for year compliance were completed 
the assessment of non information systems such as security systems  elevators  etc 
was completed during the second quarter 

table of contents renovation the purpose of the renovation phase is to ensure all date routines have been corrected to properly address year dates 
during the corporation completed of the renovation for all in house applications both mission critical and non mission critical 
installation of vendor supplied upgrades were also completed during for the other mission critical and non mission critical applications 
validation the validation phase consists of various types of testing and retesting 
firstmerit performed extensive testing of both in house and vendor written systems as well as the various connections to other systems internal and external 
non information system applications or functions such as vault operations and security systems were also tested 
testing guidelines were issued to ensure consistency and completeness throughout the organization 
integrated testing was completed to ensure the applications worked together 
during  major integrated tests occurred in march  may and october 
for example  in excess of applications were successfully tested on may  future dates ie  the system s ability to properly recognize dates involving the year and beyond were tested for both mission critical and non mission critical systems 
implementation during the implementation phase  systems are certified as year compliant and placed into production 
firstmerit placed systems  once renovated and validated  into production throughout the project 
another ffiec area mentioned was contingency planning 
firstmerit enhanced current contingency plans throughout the organization with specific year caused problem scenarios 
business areas reviewed departmental year risks and incorporated changes to their contingency plans 
this process was completed by june  firstmerit successfully opened branches on january  no significant year issues have been identified as of the date of publication of this annual report 
efforts expended during the life of the project helped ensure a smooth transition into the st century 
the corporation s total year readiness project costs spent project life to date including the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party vendor s year issues are based on presently available information 
there can be no guarantees  however  that the systems and applications of other companies on which the corporation s systems and applications rely are completely year trouble free  and therefore  will not have material adverse effect on the corporation 
the total operating costs of the year readiness project are estimated at million 
the costs incurred to date have been funded through operating cash flows and have not had a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
included in the million estimate of total project costs are capitalized amounts of approximately million 
during  the corporation expects to incur the last of the project costs included in the million estimate of approximately  related mostly to project related incentives
