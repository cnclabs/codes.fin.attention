item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash investment portfolio 
the company s general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and interest rate risk 
investments are placed in instruments with high credit quality issuers 
all liquid investments with a maturity date of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents and investments with a maturity date between three and twelve months are classified as marketable securities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the average interest rate on marketable securities is 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its cash investment portfolio since marketable securities have generally been held until maturity and unrealized gains and losses are negligible 
the company s only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  the company does not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates as it relates to its current or long term liabilities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company invoices all international customers in u 
s 
dollars except customers of the company s united kingdom uk subsidiary which are invoiced in pounds sterling 
the uk subsidiary s financials including balance sheet  revenue  and operating expenses are transacted in pounds sterling 
therefore  the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of the uk subsidiary to uk dollars in consolidation 
at this time  the company does not use instruments to hedge its foreign exposure in the uk because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations are not material
