if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in long term debt from the december  levels  the additional annual expense would be approximately on a pre tax basis 
the company currently does not hedge its exposure to floating interest rate risk 
the company s revenue derived from international operations is not material and  therefore  the risk related to foreign currency exchange rates is not material
