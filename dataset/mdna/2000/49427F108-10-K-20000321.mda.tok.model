the company owns its interests in all of its properties through the operating partnership and the finance partnership and conducts substantially all of its operations through the operating partnership 
the company owned an general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december  and the company s revenue is derived primarily from rental income  including tenant reimbursements 
the company s revenue growth in was due primarily to a full year of operating results from million in acquisitions completed in and operating results from million of development projects completed by the company in and while a significant portion of the company s revenue growth in and most of the company s revenue growth in and was due to the acquisition of million of properties in aggregate during the three year period  the market for property acquisitions continues to be competitive

funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations  as defined by nareit  an alternative measure of performance for an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit to mean net income loss before minority interests of common unitholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company considers funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper  which may differ from the methodologies used by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to funds from operations published by such other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the properties financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the properties liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the properties cash needs  including the company s ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents the company s funds from operations  by quarter  for the years ended december  and and the period february  to december  quarter ended december  september  june  march  in thousands net income     add minority interest in earnings of operating partnership     depreciation and amortization     gains losses on dispositions of operating properties other funds from operations     quarter ended december  september  june  march  in thousands net income     add minority interest in earnings of operating partnership     depreciation and amortization     other funds from operations     quarter ended february  to march  december  september  june  in thousands net income     add minority interest in earnings  depreciation and amortization     other funds from operations     inflation the majority of the company s leases require tenants to pay most operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance  and increases in common area maintenance expenses 
the effect of such provisions is to reduce the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities depending on the rights or obligations under the contract 
sfas also establishes new accounting methodologies for the following three classifications of hedges fair value  cash flow and net investment in foreign operations 
depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments or recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the company s ipo in january  management has executed a financial strategy which has positioned the company to be flexible and responsive to the variations in the public and private financial markets 
the principal objectives of the company s current debt and capital management strategies are to maintain prudent amounts of leverage and to minimize capital costs and interest expense while carefully and continuously evaluating available debt and equity resources 
the primary market risk faced by the company is the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
more specifically  the primary market risk faced by the company is market risk resulting from increasing libor based interest rates since at december   interest expense on million  or  of the company s total million of debt  including borrowings under the credit facility  are tied to a libor based interest rate 
as a result  the company pays lower rates of interest in periods of decreasing interest rates and higher rates of interest in periods of increasing interest rates 
to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on credit facility borrowings and in compliance with credit facility debt covenants  in july  the company entered into two interest rate cap agreements with a total notional amount of million to effectively limit interest expense for borrowings under the credit facility during periods of increasing interest rates 
the agreements have libor based cap rates of and expire in july the company s exposure is limited to the unamortized cost of the caps 
the cost of the cap agreements were fully amortized at december  the company is also subject to risk resulting from fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates since at december   million  or  of the company s total million of debt arrangements are established at a fixed weighted average interest rate of  and since quarterly distributions of million  million  and million paid to series a  series c and series d preferred unitholders  respectively  are calculated based upon a fixed rate of   and respectively 
as a result  the company will pay contractually agreed upon fixed rates of interest regardless of fluctuations in the general interest rate environment 
the tabular presentation below provides information about the company s interest rate sensitive financial and derivative instruments at december  all of the company s interest rate sensitive financial and derivative instruments are designated as held for purposes other than trading

the table also presents the related weighted average interest rate for outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt borrowings from through and thereafter 
for the series a and series c cumulative redeemable preferred units the preferred units  the table reflects the assumption that the company is not contractually obligated to repay the outstanding balance of the preferred units since the preferred units will either remain outstanding or be converted into shares of the company s series a and series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock  respectively  in when the preferred units become exchangeable at the option of the majority of the holders 
for the series d cumulative redeemable preferred units the preferred units  the table reflects the assumption that the company is not contractually obligated to repay the outstanding balance of the preferred units since the preferred units will either remain outstanding or be converted into shares of the series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock  in when the preferred units become exchangeable at the option of the majority of the holders 
the table also presents the related weighted average interest rate for outstanding preferred units from through the exchange date 
the same interest rates will apply when the preferred units are exchanged into the cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
for interest rate caps  the table presents notional amounts  average cap rates and the related interest rate index upon which cap rates are based  by contractual maturity date

had this agreement been in place at december   the company s percentage of fixed rate debt to total debt would have increased to and the company s weighted average interest rate for variable and fixed rate debt would have been and  respectively 
during  the company issued  series d preferred units in addition to the  series a and  series c preferred units issued during the year ended december  beginning in the first quarter of  quarterly distributions of million  calculated using a fixed rate of  will be payable to the series d preferred unitholders in addition to the million and million currently paid to the series a and series c unitholders  respectively 
for the year ended december   distributions accrued for the series d preferred unitholders totaled approximately million 
changes subsequent to december  in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of million and an interest rate cap agreement with a total notional amount of million to effectively limit interest expense on the company s floating rate debt instruments during periods of increasing interest rates 
the swap agreement  which begins in february and expires in february  requires the company to pay a fixed rate interest payment based on an interest rate of and receive a floating rate interest payment based on one month libor 
the cap agreement  which begins in july when the company s existing million cap agreements expire  has a libor based cap rate of and expires in january the company s exposure on the cap agreement is limited to the million cost of the cap agreement which the company will amortize over the life of the agreement 
had these two agreements been in place as of december   the company s ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt would have increased from to and the company s weighted average interest rate for fixed and variable rate debt would have increased from and  respectively  to and  respectively
