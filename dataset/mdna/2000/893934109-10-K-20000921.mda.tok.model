the company did not measure the gains or losses related to minimum inventory in the prior periods as it did not separately account for its minimum inventory 
therefore  there are not comparable amounts for prior periods 
the company s natural gas services operations were divested as of december ebitda is earnings loss before income tax plus interest expense  other financing costs  depreciation and amortization  impairment of long lived assets and less gain on disposition of assets 
the company believes that  in addition to cash flow from operations and net earnings loss  ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing operating performance since it provides an additional basis to evaluate the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
in evaluating ebitda  the company believes that consideration should be given  among other things  to the amount by which ebitda exceeds interest costs for the period  how ebitda compares to principal repayments on debt for the period  and how ebitda compares to capital expenditures for the period 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda such as revenue and operating expenses and the variability of such components over time  should also be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
the company s method of calculating ebitda may differ from methods used by other companies  and as a result  ebitda measures disclosed herein might not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies

refined petroleum products storage and forward sales transactions enable tpsi to purchase refined petroleum products inventory  utilize proprietary and leased tankage as well as line space controlled by tpsi in major common carrier pipelines  arbitrage location product prices differentials and transportation costs  store inventory  and  depending upon market conditions  lock in margins through sales in the futures cash market or nymex contracts 
all energy related contracts are marked to market with changes recognized in operations 
fuel and risk management logistical services provide both tpsi s large and small volume customers an assured  ratable and cost effective delivered source of refined petroleum product supply through proprietary pipelines and terminals as well as non proprietary pipeline  terminal  truck  rail and barge distribution channels 
bulk purchase and sale transactions in quantities of  barrels to  barrels or more are common 
wholesale distribution of refined petroleum products is conducted from proprietary and non proprietary truck loading terminal  storage and delivery locations 
product costs of products supply  distribution and marketing operations are primarily the cost of products purchased and also include transportation  storage  terminaling and sales commission expenses 
in addition  product costs include the market valuation change of the refined petroleum products minimum inventory 
operating expenses of products supply  distribution and marketing operations are primarily wages and employee benefits  property taxes  travel and entertainment expenses 
terminal revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products handled at tti loading racks  generally at a standard per gallon rate 
terminal fees are not regulated 
storage fees are generally based on a per barrel rate or tankage capacity committed and will vary with the duration of the arrangement  the product stored and special handling requirements  particularly when certain types of chemicals and other bulk liquids are involved 
storage fees are not regulated 
pipeline revenues are based on the volume of refined petroleum products or crude oil transported and the distance from the origin point to the delivery point 
tpi s interstate pipeline systems transport refined petroleum products and their tariffs are regulated by the ferc 
tpi s intrastate pipeline transports crude oil and its tariffs are not regulated by the ferc  but are regulated by the texas railroad commission 
operating expenses of pipeline and terminal operations include wages and employee benefits  utilities  communications  maintenance and repairs  property taxes  rent  insurance  vehicle expenses  environmental compliance costs  materials and supplies 
natural gas gathering and processing revenues are based on the inlet volume of natural gas purchased from producers under both percentage of proceeds and fee based arrangements

year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended june   compared to net earnings of million for the year ended june  after preferred stock dividends  the net loss attributable to common stockholders was million and 
million for the year ended june  and  respectively 
loss per common share for the year ended june  was basic and diluted based on million weighted average basic and average diluted shares outstanding compared to 
basic and diluted for the year ended june  the net loss resulted primarily from the million impairment charge  increased general and administrative expenses  which included non cash stock compensation costs  additional personnel costs related to separation and release agreements  and accrued personnel related costs to the corporate staff reduction and relocation plan  additional depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to the acquisitions and facilities expansion projects  increased interest expense  primarily attributable to the increase in average interest rates  and an approximate million charge to other financing costs for deferred debt issuance costs due to the amended debt agreements 
the net loss was partially offset by the increased net operating margin contribution from terminal operations  approximately million gain on the sale of bpei  and the million net deferred tax benefit 
product supply  distribution and marketing the net operating margin from product supply  distribution and marketing for the year ended june  was million as compared to million for the year ended june   a decrease of million 
this decline in net operating margin was primarily attributable to the significant cash cost incurred by the company to roll the hedges on its minimum inventory forward from month to month in an inverse market 
the company continued this strategy for the first  second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended june  recognizing some million of cash losses directly related to this minimum inventory hedging strategy 
the company also recognized an additional million loss as a result of increasing its bad debt reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its strategy and unhedged its minimum of million barrels inventory thereby eliminating any future cash costs associated with rolling forward the hedges from month to month 
accordingly  the valuation of the minimum inventories started floating with the market and any increase or decrease in valuation was marked to market on a daily basis with the resulting non cash gains and losses recognized in operating income 
the company recorded some million of such non cash gains during the fourth quarter due to this changed strategy 
the company enjoys margin opportunities by utilizing its storage capacity and inventory position when the market environment is in contango or a carry position where nearby futures prices are lower than succeeding periods 
margin opportunities are not as great when the market environment is in backwardation or an inverse position where nearby futures prices are higher than succeeding periods 
during the previous fiscal year ended june   the company enjoyed the benefit from both gasoline and heating oil markets being in contango 
however  during this current fiscal year ended june   the market environment changed when crude oil and other energy related products escalated  creating a backwardated market price structure  eliminating many of the previous year s opportunities 
terminals the net operating margin from terminal operations for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in net operating margin resulted from a million increase in revenues that was partially offset by an million increase in operating costs 
these increases were primarily the result of terminal acquisitions during the past year and the related additional million barrels handled 
the margin per barrel for the year ended june  of 
was unchanged compared to the year ended june  pipelines the net operating margin from pipeline operations for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june   a decrease of million 
the margin per barrel for the year ended june  of 
decreased 
compared to the year ended june  pipeline volumes per day increased  barrels  primarily due to increased short haul movements in the east chicago area 
the decreases in the net operating margin and the margin per barrel resulted from a decrease in higher tariff movements  an increase in operating costs  and the transfer of non carrier assets and their associated margins to terminal operations 
natural gas services the company s natural gas services operation was divested effective december  corporate and other general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase was due to additional personnel costs  related employee benefits  increased office lease rentals  increased communication expenses directly attributable to the continued expansion of the company s integrated logistical petroleum services  and the ldec  sunoco and hess terminals acquisitions 
in addition  the company incurred lease contract cancellation costs  additional personnel costs related to separation and release agreements  non cash stock compensation costs  and accrued personnel costs related to the corporate staff reduction and relocation plan  all of which amounted to approximately million during the year ended june  depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to terminal related assets being acquired and constructed during the year and past year partially offset by the disposition of natural gas services assets of bpei and impairment charge recorded at december dividend income for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june   a decrease of 
million 
dividend income is solely from west shore compared to the prior year that included dividends from lion oil company and west shore 
interest income for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june   an increase of 
million 
the increase in interest income was due primarily to the increase in interest bearing cash balances 
interest expense and other financing costs during the year ended june  were million compared to million during the year ended june   an increase of million 
the increase in interest expense of million was primarily due to increased average interest rates from to reduced by proceeds from interest rate swaps  with a minimal decrease in the average outstanding debt and  in expense related to prepayment of outstanding long term debt 
other financing costs increased million primarily due to the write off of approximately million deferred debt costs in connection with amended debt agreements 
impairment on long lived assets charge for the year ended june  was non cash impairment charges totaling million  before income taxes 
these charges include million relating to certain of the company s refined petroleum product terminals added in the acquisition of ldec and million relating to certain intangible assets recorded as a result of the same acquisition 
the impairment charge resulted from the change in the planned use of certain terminals and the abandonment of a pipeline that supplied one terminal  thereby significantly impacting the economic viability of such terminals 
each of these factors reduced or eliminated future cash flows 
the million impairment charge for the terminals reduces the book value of these assets to their estimated fair value as determined in the company s impairment analysis 
the additional million impairment charge for the intangible assets represents the unamortized balance of these assets 
management s review of the market location differentials associated with these assets showed that the company received little or no value from these assets in the last twelve months 
in addition  management does not anticipate any material future value utilizing these assets 
gain on the disposition of assets was million for the year ended june  and was primarily due to the sale of bpei partially offset by losses on the disposition and retirement of other assets no longer used or required 
income tax benefit was million for the year ended june   which represents an effective combined federal and state income tax rate of

basic and 
diluted for the year ended april  earnings before income taxes for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended april   a decrease of  or million 
the decrease in earnings before income taxes resulted from increased general and administrative expenses  additional depreciation attributable to the acquisitions of ldec and the itapco terminal corporations and expansion of natural gas services facilities  and interest expense  primarily attributable to the financing of the ldec  west shore  southwest terminal  rensselaer terminal and itapco terminal corporations acquisitions and increased working capital requirements  offset by increased net operating margin contributions from products supply  distribution and marketing operations primarily from the ldec acquisition  and from terminal operations primarily from the ldec and itapco terminal corporations acquisitions

the margin per gallon for the year ended june  of 
decreased  or 
the increase in net operating margin resulted from a significant increase in refined petroleum products volumes handled and revenues attributable to the addition of the itapco terminal corporations  southwest  ldec and rensselaer terminals acquired in november  july  october and december  respectively 
these revenue increases were partially offset by a increase in terminal operating costs primarily attributable to the ldec terminals  southwest terminal  rensselaer terminal  the itapco terminal corporations terminals and expanded east chicago and mt 
vernon terminal operations 
pipelines the net operating margin from pipeline operations for the current year and for the year ended april  was million 
the margin per gallon for the year ended june  of 
decreased  or 
pipeline volumes increased and revenues increased primarily due to increased joint tariff participation and short haul movements in the east chicago area which were offset by a increase in operating costs primarily due to increased payroll  major maintenance projects and right of way clearing costs 
natural gas services the net operating margin from natural gas services operations for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended april   a decrease of  or million 
revenues for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended april   a decrease of  or million 
the net operating margin and revenues were attributable primarily to the business activities of the grasslands facilities 
net operating margin and revenues during the year ended june  were negatively impacted by low ngl prices during the last six months of and first five months of  notwithstanding an approximate increase in ngl production 
corporate and other general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million compared to million for the year ended april   an increase of  or million 
the increase was due primarily to additional personnel costs  related employee benefits  increased office lease rentals  increased communication expenses and expenses related to the relocation of certain company employees to the atlanta  georgia office

liquidity and capital resources the following summary reflects the company s comparative net cash flows for the years ended june  and and april  in thousands 
years ended year ended june  april  net cash provided used by operating activities    net cash provided used by investing activities    net cash provided used by financing activities    net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended june  was attributable primarily to decreased inventories  trade accounts receivable  increased inventory due under exchange agreements  amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  and depreciation and amortization and reduced by decreased trade accounts payable and the net loss before income tax benefit 
the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities was to at june  compared to to at june net cash provided by investing activities was million during the year ended june  as the company disposed of its natural gas services segment which partially offset its growth through construction and improvements to existing operating facilities and acquisitions 
net cash used by investing activities was million during the year ended june  as the company continued its growth through construction and improvements to existing operating facilities and the acquisitions of ldec million  hess facilities million  a common stock interest in west shore million  southwest terminal million and rensselaer terminal million 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended june  of million primarily represented repayments of borrowings of million under the company s bank credit facility and master shelf facility  and payment of preferred stock dividends and deferred debt costs

in february  the company amended its bank credit facility led by fleet national bank formerly bankboston  n 
a 
the amended bank credit facility includes a million revolving component due december  and a million term component due june  the term component has quarterly principal payments beginning in september borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s alternate base rate plus margins subject to a eurodollar rate pricing option 
the bank credit facility includes a million same day revolving swing line under which advances may be drawn at an interest rate comparable to the eurodollar rate 
at june   the company had advances of million outstanding under the bank credit facility utilizing the eurodollar rate loan pricing option 
the average interest rate at june  was 
at june   the company had outstanding under the master shelf agreement  million of senior notes due april  and million of senior notes due october  the master shelf agreement was amended as of december  in connection with the amendment of the bank credit facility 
during the current year  the company paid off million of the senior notes with proceeds from the sale of bpei 
each of the bank credit facility and master shelf agreement is secured by certain current assets and fixed assets  and each also includes financial tests relating to fixed charge coverage  current ratio  maximum leverage ratio  consolidated tangible net worth  cash distributions and open inventory positions 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all such tests 
at june   the company had working capital of million  availability under its bank credit facility of approximately million for cash advances and letters of credit  plus an additional million for letters of credit  and additional borrowing capacity of million under the master shelf agreement 
the company believes that its current working capital position  future cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the private placement or public offering of debt and common stock  available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and the master shelf agreement  additional borrowing allowed under those agreements  and its relationship with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable the company to meet its current capital requirements 
capital expenditures anticipated for the year ending june  are estimated to be million for terminal and pipeline facilities  and assets to support these facilities and could exceed that amount if additional facilities enhancement projects and possible acquisitions being considered by the company materialize 
future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability  economics and cost of appropriate acquisitions which the company identifies and evaluates  the economics  cost and required regulatory approvals with respect to the expansion and enhancement of existing systems and facilities  the customer demand for the services the company provides  local  state and federal governmental regulations  environmental compliance requirements  and the availability of debt financing and equity capital on acceptable terms 
year matters historically  certain computer software and computer based management information systems information technology  as well as certain hardware containing embedded microcontrollers and microprocessors embedded technology  were designed to utilize a two digit rather than a four digit date field and consequently may cause computers  computer controlled systems and equipment with embedded technology to malfunction or incorrectly process data in the year  resulting in significant system failures 
the company relies on information technology  as well as embedded technology  to operate instruments and equipment in conducting its normal business activities 
certain of the information technology and embedded technology may not have been designed to function properly with respect to the application of dating systems relating to the year in response  the company developed and executed a year plan 
while achieving year readiness does not mean correcting every year limitation  critical systems  as well as relationships with third party customers  vendors and local  state and federal government agencies have been  and continue to be  evaluated and are expected to be suitable for continued use into and beyond the year through june   the company had incurred third party costs of approximately million related to year compliance matters 
these costs have been funded through operating cash flows and do not include internal costs 
the company does not separately record internal costs incurred with respect to implementation of the year plan 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs for the information systems and field operations personnel  including senior management  involved in carrying out the year plan  as well as related travel and other out of pocket expenses 
the company has had minimal business disruptions as the result of year issues during the six months ended june  while the company does not anticipate that year issues will have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company  if the company information technology or embedded technology  or those of business partners  fail to maintain year readiness it could have a material adverse impact on the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  was issued in june by the financial accounting standards board 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
this statement requires an entity to establish at the inception of a hedge  the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
certain provisions of sfas were amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of statement 
sfas  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk risk policies the company is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
risk management policies have been established by the risk management committee rmc to monitor and control these market risks 
the rmc is comprised primarily of senior executives 
the rmc has responsibility for oversight with respect to all product risk management and the audit committee approves the financial exposure limits 
commodity risk the company s earnings  cash flow and liquidity may be significantly affected by a variety of factors beyond its control  including the supply of  and demand for  commodities such as refined products and crude oil 
the demand for these refined products  as well as crude oil  depends on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation 
as a result  refined products and crude oil experience price volatility  which directly impacts the company s revenues  product costs and operating income 
the company has developed risk management strategies to mitigate the risk associated with petroleum price volatility on its product inventories 
the company believes these strategies are integral to its risk policies since product inventories are required to effectively operate the company s logistical services business and such inventories are expected to be purchased  sold and carried over extended periods of time in the ordinary course of business 
the company s strategies are intended to minimize the impact of refined product prices volatility on profitability and generally involve the purchase and sale of exchange traded  energy related futures and options 
in addition  the company to a lesser extent enters into energy swap agreements similar to those traded on the exchanges  such as crack spreads  which better match specific price movements in the company s markets 
these strategies are designed to minimize  on a short term basis  the company s exposure to the risk of fluctuations in refined product margins 
the number of barrels of crude oil and refined products covered by such contracts varies and are closely managed and subject to internally established risk standards 
a sensitivity analysis prepared by the company estimates exposure to market risk associated with derivative commodity positions 
this analysis may differ from actual results 
the fair value of each derivative commodity position was based on quoted futures prices 
market risk was estimated based on a change in prices 
as of june  and  the company s sensitivity to market risk associated with commodity instruments  excluding unhedged minimum inventory  was immaterial 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its variable rate debt 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
in august  the company entered into two swap agreements with money center banks to offset the exposure of an increase in interest rates 
these swap agreements are marked to market and recognized in operations at june  in august  the company bought back one of the swap agreements for approximately million 
if market interest rates had averaged higher lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year  interest expense would have increased decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased increased by approximately million excluding any impact from interest rate swap agreements 
comparatively  if market interest rates had averaged higher lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year  interest expense would have increased decreased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased increased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the variable rate borrowings outstanding as of june  and in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to manage exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the interest sensitivity analysis assumed no changes in the company s financial structure
