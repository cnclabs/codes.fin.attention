all of the following financial information is reported on an operating basis  except where indicated

huntington s operating earnings for were million  compared with million in and million in diluted eps was  compared with in and in  an increase of and  respectively 
per share amounts for all prior periods have been restated to reflect the ten percent stock dividend distributed to shareholders in july return on average equity roe was for  versus and for each of the two preceding years 
return on average assets roa was for the current year and in each of the two previous years

huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis table loan portfolio composition december  in millions of dollars commercial      real estate construction  mortgage      consumer loans      lease financing     total loans      note there are no loans outstanding which would be considered a concentration of lending in any particular industry or group of industries 
table maturity schedule of selected loans in millions of dollars december  after one within but within after one year five years five years total commercial    real estate construction  total     variable interest rates  fixed interest rates note loan balances above are net of unearned income and there are no loans outstanding which would be a concentration of lending in any particular industry or group of industries 
adjusted for the impact of the credit card sale  average total loans grew from commercial loans grew by while consumer loans grew by  led by strong volumes in vehicle leasing and home equity loans 
average loans secured by real estate  which include residential mortgage lending  increased by compared to core deposits represent huntington s most significant source of funding 
when combined with other core funding sources  core deposits provide approximately of huntington s funding needs 
core deposits were billion  down 
billion  or  from the prior year end 
this decline was attributable to the runoff of retail certificates of deposit reinvested by customers into alternative investments such as mutual funds and annuities  including those sold by huntington 
excluding time deposits  average core deposits grew with particular strength in savings and transaction account products 
huntington continued to raise short term wholesale monies and issue unsecured medium term notes as sources of additional funding 
lines of business huntington views its operations as five distinct segments 
retail banking  corporate banking  dealer sales  and the private financial group are the company s major business lines 
the fifth segment includes huntington s treasury function and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense 
line of business results are determined based upon huntington s business profitability reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
this process is designed around huntington s organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
below is a brief description of each line of business and a discussion of the business segment results  which can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis retail banking retail banking provides products and services to retail and business banking customers 
this business unit s products include home equity loans  first mortgage loans  installment loans  small business loans  credit cards  deposit products  as well as investment and insurance services 
these products and services are offered through huntington s traditional banking network  in store branches  direct bank  and web bank 
retail banking net income was million for versus million for  representing a increase 
a portion of the growth came from the full year benefit of huntington s acquisition of banking offices in florida in june excluding this impact  the retail banking business line grew 
non interest income for the year increased over the prior year with strength in service charges  brokerage and insurance income  and electronic banking income 
mortgage banking revenues were off as higher market rates curtailed new loan production 
non interest expenses were relatively flat for the year as expense containment offset volume related expense increases 
this segment contributed of huntington s net income and comprised of its total loan portfolio 
corporate banking customers in this segment represent the middle market and large corporate banking relationships which use a variety of banking products and services including  but not limited to  commercial loans  asset based financing  international trade  and cash management 
huntington s capital markets division also provides alternative financing solutions for larger business clients  including privately placed debt  syndicated commercial lending  and the sale of interest rate protection products 
corporate banking posted net income of million for the year  a increase over the increase was the result of solid loan and deposit growth  despite the impact of certain loan paydowns on significant larger credits during the year  combined with lower charge offs on portfolio loans 
this segment contributed of huntington s annual earnings and represented of the total loan portfolio 
dealer sales dealer sales product offerings pertain to the automobile lending sector and include floor plan financing  as well as indirect consumer loans and leases 
indirect consumer loans and leases comprise the vast majority of the business and involve the financing of vehicles purchased by individuals through dealerships 
excluding the million  net of tax  lease residual valuation adjustment  net income totaled million for and million for robust vehicle leasing volumes contributed to a increase in net income 
tighter expense control helped to mitigate weakness in non interest income  which included losses in realized from the disposition of leased vehicles 
this business line totaled of huntington s net income in the recent twelve months and of its outstanding loans 
private financial group huntington s private financial group pfg provides an array of products and services designed to meet the needs of huntington s higher wealth banking customers 
revenue is derived through the sale of personal trust  asset management  investment advisory  insurance  and deposit and loan products and services 
pfg provides customers with one stop shopping for all their financial needs 
pfg achieved net income for the year just ended of million  an increase from million in net interest income for the year declined due to lower loan volumes 
non interest income increased for the same period primarily due to a increase in service charges  a increase in trust revenue  and a increase in credit card income 
direct non interest expenses declined over the same period 
this segment represented of huntington s operating results and of total loans at december  treasury other huntington uses a match funded transfer pricing system to allocate interest income and interest expense to its business segments 
this approach consolidates the interest rate risk management of huntington into its treasury group 
as part of its overall interest rate risk and liquidity management strategy  the treasury group administers an investment portfolio of approximately billion 
revenue and expense associated with these activities remain within the treasury group 
additionally  the treasury other segment absorbs unassigned assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  and expense that cannot be directly assigned or allocated to one of huntington s lines of business 
costs associated with intangibles that have not been allocated to the major business lines are also included in other 
this segment reported net income of million for the recent year 
in comparing annual results for with  the increase was attributable to higher non interest income from gains realized from the credit card sale to chase and lower non interest expenses in almost all categories before amortization of intangibles and other non huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis recurring expenses offset by lower net interest income and securities gains 
amortization of intangibles included a full year s impact from the florida branch acquisition that occurred in june results of operations net interest income huntington s net interest income was  million in  versus  million in  and  million in the net interest margin  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was during the recent twelve months  compared with and in the two preceding years 
the margin decline is primarily due to the funding of loan growth through more expensive wholesale funds as loan growth outpaced core deposit growth 
interest rate swaps and other off balance sheet financial instruments used for asset liability management purposes provided benefits of million basis points  million basis points and million basis points in each of the recent three years 
provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses reflects management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all represents management s assessment of possible losses inherent in huntington s loan portfolio 
huntington allocates the all to each loan category based on a detailed credit quality review performed periodically on specific commercial loans based on size and relative risk and other relevant factors such as portfolio performance  internal controls  and impacts from mergers and acquisitions 
loss factors are applied on larger  commercial and industrial and commercial real estate credits and represent management s estimate of table change in net interest income due to changes in average volume and interest rates increase decrease increase decrease from previous from previous year due to year due to fully tax equivalent basis yield yield in millions of dollars volume rate total volume rate total interest bearing deposits in banks trading account securities federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements mortgages held for sale taxable securities tax exempt securities total loans total earning assets interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits other domestic time deposits certificates of deposit of  or more foreign time deposits short term borrowings medium term notes subordinated notes and other long term debt  including capital securities total interest bearing liabilities net interest income the change in interest rates due to both rate and volume has been allocated between the factors in proportion of the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
calculated assuming a tax rate 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis the inherent loss 
the portion of the allowance allocated to homogeneous consumer loans is determined by applying projected loss ratios to various segments of the loan portfolio giving consideration to existing economic conditions and trends 
projected loss ratios incorporate factors such as trends in past due and non accrual amounts  recent loan loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and concentrations of various loan categories 
actual loss ratios experienced in the future  however  could vary from those projected because a loan s performance depends not only on economic factors but also other factors unique to each customer 
the diversity in size of corporate commercial loans can be significant as well and even if the projected number of loans deteriorate  the dollar exposure could significantly vary from estimated amounts 
additionally  the impact on individual customers from many economic events that have occurred may yet be unknown 
such events include high energy prices  low automobile and home sales in selected markets 
to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  an unallocated allowance is maintained 
for analytical purposes  the allocation of the all is provided in table while amounts are allocated to various portfolio segments  the total all  less the portion attributable to reserves as prescribed under provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million in  down from million in two years ago  the provision totaled million 
the decline in the current year s provision is due in large part to the credit card sale to chase 
net charge offs as a percent of average total loans declined to 
from

additional information regarding the all and asset quality appears in the credit risk section 
non interest income excluding gains from securities sales and gains from the sale of credit cards  non interest income totaled million in  a increase over million in comparable non interest income was million in significant improvements were experienced in several fee based activities as fee income as a percentage of total revenue increased from in to in service charges on deposit accounts increased in due to related pricing changes  growth in sales of cash management products  and an overall higher level of transaction deposit accounts 
brokerage and insurance income was up because of higher retail investment and insurance sales through huntington s growing network of licensed investment and insurance representatives combined with some customer migration from certificates of deposit to investment products 
electronic banking fees grew nearly in due to increased customer usage of huntington s check card product and increased web bank relationships 
securities transactions netted gains of million in compared with million for the same twelve month period a year ago 
in  huntington sold a portion of its investment in common stock of s corporation at a gain of million 
substantially offsetting this gain were losses from the sale of fixed income investments  as huntington repositioned the portfolio of securities available for sale 
non interest expense excluding special charges and other non recurring expenses  non interest expense was million  versus million and million in the two preceding years 
other non recurring expenses totaled million in and included a million valuation adjustment of vehicles underlying certain direct financing leases 
in addition  huntington recorded costs related to the company s huntington program as well as other one time expenses  which included amounts paid for management consulting and other professional services as well as million for a special cash award to employees for achievement of the program goals for huntington is a collaborative effort among all employees to evaluate processes and procedures and the way huntington conducts its business with a mission of maximizing efficiency through all aspects of the organization 
as a result of the huntington program  overall non interest expenses declined  despite a full year of expenses related to the june florida branch acquisition 
these banking office additions  along with depreciation expense related to huntington s operations center  which was occupied in the second half of  and year system upgrades drove increases in net occupancy and equipment expenses 
most other expense categories declined  representing the success of the huntington program 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis the efficiency ratio represents non interest expense as a percentage of fees and other income plus tax equivalent net interest income and is a measure of cost to generate a dollar of revenue 
huntington s efficiency ratio for improved to from in during the fourth quarter of  huntington recorded a million special charge related to costs for several strategic actions that enhanced profitability  including the sale or closure of underperforming banking offices and the termination of certain business activities 
at december   huntington had substantially completed all of its strategic initiatives  including the sale or closure of identified banking offices  discontinuation of various business activities and the targeted reductions in the workforce 
all significant components of the charge were utilized as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the special charges 
in connection with the acquisition of first michigan in  huntington incurred a merger related charge of million consisting primarily of personnel  facilities  and systems costs  as well as million of professional fees and other costs to effect the business combination 
all activities related to this charge were completed by december  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  compared with million in and million in huntington s effective tax rate approximated in the recent and preceding year versus in the lower effective rate in and was due primarily to a higher mix of tax exempt income 
furthermore  during  huntington established a private charitable foundation with an initial funding of million 
the private foundation was established in order to realize significant federal income tax benefits that are allowed under the internal revenue code 
the rate was higher than normal in as a result of significant non deductible expenses incurred in connection with the first michigan and other bank acquisitions 
interest rate risk and liquidity management interest rate risk management huntington seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility arising from shifts in interest rates 
the asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management  establishing broad policies and specific operating limits that govern a variety of financial risks inherent in huntington s operations  including interest rate  liquidity  counterparty  settlement  and market risks 
on and off balance sheet strategies and tactics are reviewed and monitored regularly by alco to ensure consistency with approved risk tolerances 
interest rate risk management is a dynamic process  encompassing business flows onto the balance sheet  wholesale investment and funding  and the changing market and business environment 
effective management of interest rate risk begins with appropriately diversified investments and funding sources 
to accomplish its overall balance sheet objectives  huntington regularly accesses a variety of global markets money  bond  futures  and options as well as numerous trading exchanges 
in addition  dealers in over the counter financial instruments provide availability of interest rate swaps as needed 
measurement and monitoring of interest rate risk is an ongoing process 
a key element in this process is huntington s estimation of the amount that net interest income will change over a twelve to twenty four month period given a directional shift in interest rates 
the income simulation model used by huntington captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on mortgages and consumer installment loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization on revolving credit instruments  and table investment securities december  in thousands of dollars us treasury and federal agencies states and political subdivisions    total investment securities    amortized cost and fair values by maturity at december  amortized fair in thousands of dollars cost value yield states and political subdivisions under year   years   years   over years total   total investment securities   note weighted average yields were calculated on the basis of amortized cost and have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  assuming a tax rate 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  eg interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships  as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
while these assumptions are inherently uncertain  management assigns probabilities and  therefore  believes at any point in time that the model provides a reasonably accurate estimate of huntington s interest rate risk exposure 
management reporting of this information is regularly shared with the board of directors 
at december   the results of huntington s interest sensitivity analysis indicated that net interest income would be expected to decrease by approximately if rates rose basis points and would drop an estimated in the event of a basis point increase 
if rates declined and basis points  huntington would benefit and  respectively

weighted average yields were calculated on the basis of amortized cost 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis active interest rate risk management necessitates the use of various types of off balance sheet financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
risk that is created by different indices on products  by unequal terms to maturity of assets and liabilities  and by products that are appealing to customers but incompatible with current risk limits can be eliminated or decreased in a cost efficient manner by utilizing interest rate swaps 
often  the swap strategy has enabled huntington to lower the overall cost of raising wholesale funds 
similarly  financial futures  interest rate caps and floors  options  and forward rate agreements are used to control financial risk effectively 
off balance sheet instruments are often preferable to similar cash instruments because  though performing identically  they require less capital while preserving access to the marketplace 
table below illustrates the approximate market values  estimated maturities and weighted average rates of the interest rate swaps used by huntington in its interest rate risk management program at december  as is the case with cash securities  the market value of interest rate swaps is largely a function of the financial market s expectations regarding the future direction of interest rates 
accordingly  current market values are not necessarily indicative of the future impact of the swaps on net interest income 
this will depend  in large part  on the shape of the yield curve as well as interest rate levels 
with respect to the variable rate information presented in table  management made no assumptions regarding future changes in interest rates 
the pay rates on huntington s receive fixed swaps vary based on movements in the applicable london interbank offered rate libor 
receive fixed asset conversion swaps and receive fixed liability conversion swaps with notional values of million and million  respectively  have embedded written libor based call options 
basis swaps are contracts that provide for both parties to receive interest payments according to different rate indices and are used to protect against changes in spreads between market rates 
the contractual amount of interest payments to be exchanged are based on the notional values of the swap portfolio 
these notional values do not represent direct credit exposures 
at december   huntington s credit risk from interest rate swaps used for asset liability management purposes was million  which represents the sum of the aggregate fair value of positions that have become favorable to huntington  including any accrued interest receivable due from counterparties 
in order to minimize the risk that a swap counterparty will not satisfy its interest payment obligation under the terms of the contract  huntington performs credit reviews on all counterparties  restricts the number of counterparties used to a select group of high quality institutions  obtains collateral  and enters into formal netting arrangements 
huntington has never experienced any past due amounts from a swap counterparty and does not anticipate nonperformance in the future by any such counterparties 
the total notional amount of off balance sheet instruments used by huntington on behalf of customers for which the related interest rate risk is offset by third party contracts was billion at december  the credit exposure from these contracts is not material and furthermore  these separate activities  which are accounted for at fair value  are not a significant part of huntington s operations 
accordingly  they have been excluded from the above discussion of off balance sheet financial instruments and the related table

the objective of alco in this regard is to maintain an optimum balance of maturities among huntington s assets and liabilities such that sufficient cash  or access to cash  is available at all times to meet the needs of borrowers  depositors  and creditors  as well as to fund corporate expansion and other activities 
a chief source of huntington s liquidity is derived from the large retail deposit base accessible by its network of geographically dispersed banking offices 
this core funding is supplemented by huntington s demonstrated ability to raise funds in capital markets and to access funds nationwide 
the bank subsidiary s billion domestic bank note and billion european bank note programs are significant sources of wholesale funding 
under these programs  unsecured senior and subordinated notes are issuable with maturities ranging from one month to thirty years 
a similar million note program exists at the parent holding company  the proceeds from which are used from time to time to fund certain non banking activities  finance acquisitions  repurchase huntington s common stock  or for other general corporate purposes 
at december   approximately billion of notes were available under these programs to fund huntington s future activities 
huntington also has million of capital securities outstanding through its subsidiaries  huntington capital i and ii 
a million line of credit is also available to the parent holding company to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term working capital needs 
table maturity of domestic certificates of deposit of  or more as of december  in thousands of dollars three months or less  over three through six months  over six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  while liability sources are many  significant liquidity is also available from huntington s investment and loan portfolios 
alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the business and ensures that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events

credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers  purchasing mortgage backed securities and entering into off balance sheet financial derivative instruments 
huntington s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize in market lending 
credit personnel are integrally involved in the origination and underwriting process to ensure adherence to risk policies and underwriting standards 
huntington also manages credit risk through avoiding highly leveraged transactions  diversifying to avoid excessive industry or other concentrations  selling participations to third parties  and requiring collateral 
the credit administration function employs extensive risk management techniques  including forecasting  to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified 
these procedures provide executive management with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary  and take corrective actions on a proactive basis 
non performing assets consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest  loans that have been renegotiated based upon financial difficulties of the borrower  and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
generally  huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis commercial and real estate loans are placed on non accrual status and stop accruing interest when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is days past due 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
consumer loans are not placed on non accrual status  rather they are charged off in accordance with regulatory statutes  which is generally no more than days 
a charge off may be delayed in circumstances when collateral is repossessed and anticipated to sell at a future date 
total non performing assets were million and million  respectively  at december   and as of the same dates  non performing loans represented

loans past due ninety days or more but continuing to accrue interest were million at december   versus million one year ago

amounts actually collected and recorded as interest income for these loans totaled million 
capital and dividends huntington places significant emphasis on the maintenance of strong capital  which promotes investor confidence  provides access to the national markets under favorable terms  and enhances business growth and acquisition opportunities 
huntington also recognizes the importance of managing excess capital and continually strives to maintain an appropriate balance between capital adequacy and returns to shareholders 
capital is managed at each subsidiary based upon the respective risks and growth opportunities  as well as regulatory requirements 
huntington bancshares incorporated management s discussion and analysis average shareholders equity was billion for the twelve months ended december   and huntington s ratio of average equity to average assets in the recent year was  compared with one year ago 
risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve board set minimum capital requirements and require institutions to calculate risk based capital ratios by assigning risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items  such as interest rate swaps and loan commitments 
these guidelines further define well capitalized levels for tier  total capital  and leverage ratio purposes at   and  respectively 
at the recent year end  huntington s tier capital ratio was  its total capital ratio was  and its leverage ratio was  each of which exceeds the well capitalized requirements 
huntington s bank subsidiary also had regulatory capital ratios in excess of the levels established for well capitalized institutions 
cash dividends declared were 
a share in  up from a stock dividend was distributed to shareholders in the year just ended  marking the twenty sixth consecutive year in which huntington has issued a stock split or stock dividend 
during  huntington repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions 
the million share authorization after adjusting for the july ten percent stock dividend approved by the board of directors in the third quarter of is still in process of completion 
as of december   million shares remained under the authorization 
repurchased shares are being reserved for reissue in connection with huntington s dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans as well as for stock dividends  acquisitions  and other corporate purposes

roa was  versus in last year s final three months 
cash basis roe was  up from in the comparable period of cash basis roa was versus one year ago 
net interest income was million in the recent quarter  a decrease of over the corresponding period last year 
this decrease reflects the decline associated with the credit card sale as well as non recurring events caused by the uncertainties involving the transition to the year such as higher short term libor rates and cash reserve levels 
after adjusting for the sale of the credit card portfolio  average total loans grew and average earning assets increased over prior quarter balances as a result of strong volumes in automobile leasing and home equity lending 
core deposits declined annualized  primarily due to slight declines in transaction accounts believed to be related to customer uncertainty surrounding the year the provision for loan losses  favorably impacted by the credit card sale  was million in the last quarter of the year  compared with million in the same period of annualized net charge offs declined to

securities transactions for the recent quarter included the sale of a portion of huntington s investment in common stock of s corporation  which netted a gain of million 
excluding securities gains and the million gain from the sale of huntington s credit card portfolio as discussed above  non interest income was up to million for the recent quarter from million a year ago 
growth was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter sale of the credit card portfolio combined with lower mortgage banking income 
significant growth was seen in service charges on deposit accounts related to expanded cash management sales and recent pricing changes 
increased check card and web bank fees drove electronic banking fees up from the same period a year ago 
brokerage and insurance income was up from the fourth quarter  led by retail investment sales 
non interest expense  excluding other non recurring expenses and special charges  totaled million in the most recent three months  versus million in the final three months of the decline is due to huntington s emphasis on efficiency and cost containment 
decreased personnel and related expenses helped offset higher occupancy and equipment costs associated with strategic spending for new banking offices and the move to huntington s new operations center
