ata provides scheduled service through nonstop and connecting flights from the gateways of chicago midway and indianapolis to popular vacation destinations such as hawaii  las vegas  florida  california  mexico and the caribbean  as well as to philadelphia  denver  dallas ft 
worth and new york city s laguardia and john f 
kennedy airports 
ata also provides charter service throughout the world to independent tour operators  specialty charter customers and the us military 
for the year ended december   the company generated record operating income and net income 
although all business units performed well during this period  scheduled service continued to generate the strongest overall growth in pricing and traffic of the major business units 
o scheduled service revenue per available seat mile rasm increased in  as compared to o scheduled service asms increased between and o load factor increased to in as compared to in in  the company s consolidated measures of rasm and casm were impacted by the acquisition of tour operators travel charter and key tours  because these companies contributed significant operating revenue and expense to consolidated results  without increasing asms

b a departure is a single takeoff and landing operated by a single aircraft between an origin city and a destination city 
c block hours for any aircraft represent the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the origin city boarding ramp to the moment it comes to rest at the destination city boarding ramp 
d revenue passenger miles rpms represent the number of seats occupied by revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
rpms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity actually sold by the company 
e available seat miles asms represent the number of seats available for sale to revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
asms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity offered for sale by the company  whether sold or not 
f passenger load factor is the percentage derived by dividing rpms by asms 
passenger load factor is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because incremental passengers normally provide incremental revenue and profitability when seats are sold individually 
in the case of commercial charter and military government charter  load factor is less relevant because an entire aircraft is sold by the company instead of individual seats 
consolidated load factors and scheduled service load factors for the company are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but load factors for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
g passengers enplaned are the number of revenue passengers who occupied seats on the company s flights 
this measure is also referred to as passengers boarded 
h revenue per asm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as rasm 
rasm measures the company s unit revenue using total available seat capacity 
in the case of scheduled service  rasm is a measure of the combined impact of load factor and yield see j below for the definition of yield 
i cost per asm expressed in cents is total operating expense divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as casm 
casm measures the company s unit cost using total available seat capacity 
j revenue per rpm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total rpms 
this measure is also referred to as yield 
yield is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because yield is a measure of the average price paid by customers purchasing individual seats 
yield is less relevant to the commercial charter and military government charter businesses because the entire aircraft is sold at one time for one price 
consolidated yields and scheduled service yields are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but yields for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
operating revenues total operating revenues in increased to billion from million in this increase was due to a million increase in scheduled service revenues  a million increase in commercial charter revenues  a million increase in ground package revenues  a million increase in other revenues  and a million increase in military government charter revenues

the company has announced that effective april  it will begin nonstop service to washington dc  and effective may   it will begin nonstop service from chicago midway to both boston and seattle 
beginning in  the company also had a code share agreement with chicago express under which  as later amended  chicago express operated seat jetstream propeller aircraft between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis  milwaukee  des moines  dayton  grand rapids  lansing and madison 
on april   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of chicago express airlines  inc  which continues to operate these services as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company s operations at chicago midway continued to be the fastest growing portion of its scheduled service business in the company operated a peak schedule of daily jet and commuter departures from chicago midway and served destinations on a nonstop basis in the summer of  as compared to peak daily departures and nonstop destinations served in the summer of in  the company completed a million renovation of the existing terminal facilities at chicago midway to enhance their attractiveness and convenience for its customers 
the company also presently expects to occupy jet gates and one commuter aircraft gate at the new chicago midway terminal which is presently scheduled for completion in  as compared to the six jet gates currently occupied in the existing terminal 
the company s growing commitment to chicago midway is consistent with its strategy for enhancing revenues and profitability in scheduled service by focusing primarily on low cost  nonstop flights from airports where it has market or aircraft advantages in addition to its low cost 
the company expects its growing concentration of connecting flights at chicago midway to provide both revenue premiums and operating cost efficiencies  as compared to the company s other gateway cities 
in addition  the company plans to build an fis facility at chicago midway to facilitate direct international flights 
the company s hawaii service accounted for of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures in  as compared to and  respectively  in the company provided nonstop services in both years from los angeles  phoenix and san francisco to both honolulu and maui  with connecting service between honolulu and maui 
the company provides these services through a marketing alliance with the largest independent tour operator serving leisure travelers to hawaii from the united states 
the company distributes the remaining seats on these flights through normal scheduled service distribution channels 
the company believes it has superior operating efficiencies in west coast hawaii markets due to the higher daily hours of utilization obtained for both aircraft and crews in this market than for other commercial charter and military applications

kennedy international airport and san juan 
between june and september  the company operated seasonal service between new york s john f 
kennedy international airport and dublin and shannon  ireland 
the company continuously evaluates the profitability of its scheduled service markets and expects to adjust its service from time to time 
the company believes that scheduled service yields and load factors in and have benefited from strong customer demand for air transportation in the united states during a period of constrained industry growth in seat capacity relative to this demand 
commercial charter revenues 
the company s commercial charter revenues are derived principally from independent tour operators and specialty charter customers 
the company s commercial charter product provides full service air transportation to hundreds of customer designated destinations throughout the world 
the company believes that tour operator and specialty charter are businesses where the company s experience and size provide meaningful competitive advantage and are businesses to which the company remains committed 
commercial charter revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in the company has expanded its seat capacity in the commercial and military government charter business units through the acquisition of long range lockheed l series aircraft 
in july  the company committed to the purchase of five such aircraft for delivery between the third quarter of and the end of although lockheed l series maintenance procedures and cockpit design are similar to the company s existing fleet of lockheed l series and series aircraft  they differ operationally in that their ten to eleven hour range permits them to operate nonstop to parts of asia  south america and central and eastern europe using an all coach seating configuration preferred by the us military and most of the company s commercial charter customers 
the company placed four of these aircraft into service in commercial and military government charter operations during  which has increased the available seat capacity for these charter business units  in addition to opening new long range market opportunities to the company which it cannot serve with its existing fleet 
the company expects to place the fifth l series aircraft into service in the first quarter of the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the commercial charter operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages and the company operates in two principal components of the commercial charter business  known as track charter and specialty charter 
the larger track charter business component is generally comprised of low frequency but repetitive domestic and international flights between city pairs  which support high passenger load factors and are marketed through tour operators  providing value priced and convenient nonstop service to vacation destinations for the leisure traveler 
since track charter resembles scheduled service in terms of its repetitive flying patterns between fixed city pairs  it allows the company to achieve reasonable levels of crew and aircraft utilization although less than for scheduled service  and provides the company with meaningful protection from some fuel price increases through the use of fuel escalation reimbursement clauses in tour operator contracts 
track charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in specialty charter including incentive travel programs is a product which is designed to meet the unique requirements of the customer and is a business characterized by lower frequency of operation and by greater variation in city pairs served than the track charter business 
specialty charter includes such diverse contracts as flying university alumni to football games  transporting political candidates on campaign trips and moving nasa space shuttle ground crews to alternate landing sites 
the company also operates an increasing number of trips in all first class configuration for certain corporate and high end leisure clients 
although lower utilization of crews and aircraft and infrequent service to specialty destinations often result in higher average operating costs  the company has determined that the revenue premium earned by meeting special customer requirements more than compensates for these increased costs 
the diversity of the company s three fleet types also permits the company to meet a customer s particular needs by choosing the aircraft type which provides the most economical solution for those requirements 
specialty charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in military government charter revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the military government flight operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages and the company participates in two related military government charter programs known as fixed award and short term expansion 
pursuant to the us military s fixed award system  each participating airline is awarded certain mobilization value points based upon the number and type of aircraft made available by that airline for military flying 
in order to increase the number of points awarded  the company has traditionally participated in contractor teaming arrangements with other airlines 
under these arrangements  the team has a greater likelihood of receiving fixed award business and  to the extent that the award includes passenger transport  the opportunity for the company to operate this flying is enhanced since the company represents a majority of the passenger transport capacity of the team 
as part of its participation in teaming arrangements  the company pays a commission to the team  which passes that revenue on to all team members based upon their mobilization points 
all airlines participating in the fixed award business contract annually with the us military from october to the following september for each contract year  reimbursement rates are determined for aircraft types and mission categories based upon operating cost data submitted by the participating airlines 
these contracts are generally not subject to renegotiation once they become effective 
short term expansion business is awarded by the us military first on a pro rata basis to those carriers who have been provided fixed award business and then to any other carrier with aircraft availability 
expansion flying is generally offered to airlines on very short notice 
the overall amount of military flying that the company performs in any one year is dependent upon several factors  including i the percentage of mobilization value points represented by the company s team as compared to total mobilization value points of all providers of military service  ii the percentage of passenger capacity of the company with respect to its own team  iii the amount of fixed award and expansion flying required by the us military in each contract year  and iv the availability of the company s aircraft to accept and fly expansion awards 
in april  the company announced that it had joined a new teaming arrangement with several major passenger and cargo airlines 
under this new teaming arrangement  the company expects its military government charter revenues to increase to approximately million for the contract year beginning october this represents more than a increase over the company s fiscal year military government charter revenues of million 
ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental and cruise accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company markets these ground packages to its ambassadair club members and through its ata leisure corp 
subsidiary to its scheduled service and tour operator customers 
in  ground package revenues increased to million  as compared to million in effective january   the company completed the acquisition of travel charter international tci in detroit  michigan see note to consolidated financial statements 
tci provides tour packages  including ground arrangements  primarily to mexican  caribbean and central american destinations during the winter season  and to europe in the summer 
prior to the acquisition  the company had a relationship with tci as a major provider of passenger airline services for over years 
approximately million of the increase in ground package revenues was attributable to the incremental ground package revenues of tci  none of which were included in the company s results of operations in effective april   the company completed the purchase of key tours  inc and affiliated companies  also a tour operator serving the detroit metropolitan area see note to consolidated financial statements 
key tours provides tour packages  including ground arrangements  to such leisure destinations as las vegas and florida 
the company has had a relationship with key tours as a major provider of passenger airline services for over years 
approximately million of the increase in ground package revenues was attributable to the incremental ground package revenues of key tours  none of which were included in the company s results of operations in the number of ground packages sold and the average revenue earned by the company for a ground package sale are a function of the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered and general competitive conditions with other air carriers offering similar products in the company s markets  all of which are factors that can change from period to period 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled and charter operations of the company 
other revenues increased to million during  as compared to million in the company s other revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues earned in non passenger airline businesses  especially cargo revenues which increased approximately million  largely due to the acquisition of the remaining of the amber air freight partnership at the beginning of see note to consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related local  state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by approximately in as compared to  in order to appropriately staff the company s growth between periods 
this growth was most significant in categories of employees which are influenced directly by flight activity 
some employment growth in was also provided to improve customer service in targeted areas  such as at airport ticket counters  in reservations and in other departments primarily involved in delivering services to the company s customers 
the company also recorded million in additional salaries  wages and benefits in attributable to new companies acquired see note to consolidated financial statements 
the average rate of pay earned by the company s employees including all categories of salaries  wages and benefits increased by approximately in as compared to in  the company recorded million in variable compensation and related payroll taxes as compared to  when million in such compensation was recorded 
the company s variable compensation plans in both and paid significant cash awards to employees as a result of the achievement of specific profitability targets 
salaries  wages and benefits cost per asm increased in to cents  as compared to cents in this unit cost increase was attributable both to the faster rate of growth in average equivalent employees between years than seat capacity  and to the increase in average salaries paid between years 
fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company consumed more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations between years  which resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million 
jet fuel consumption increased primarily due to the increased number of block hours of jet flying operations between periods 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  an increase of between years 
fuel consumption growth between and was more than total block hour growth since the lockheed l fleet flew proportionately more block hours and consumes approximately twice the gallons per block hour of the boeing and boeing during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed increased by as compared to  resulting in an increase in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years 
this increase in fuel price was experienced generally in the airline industry as a result of significant increases in average crude oil and distillate market prices as compared to  particularly in the last two quarters of the company entered into fuel price hedge contracts during and the first six months of under which the company sought to reduce the risk of fuel price increases 
these hedges impacted fuel and oil expense by and in and  respectively 
fuel and oil expense increased to cents per asm in  as compared to cents per asm in  primarily due to the period to period increase in the average price of fuel consumed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company recorded goodwill amortization expense of million in due to the acquisition of new businesses see note to consolidated financial statements  which was not incurred in depreciation expense attributable to owned engines  airframes and leasehold improvements increased million in  as compared to the company purchased nine boeing aircraft in  which had been previously financed through operating leases  thereby increasing depreciation expense on engines and airframes between years 
the company recorded a reduction in aircraft rental expense between periods for the termination of operating leases for these aircraft  which is further described below under aircraft rentals 
the company also placed four lockheed l owned aircraft into service in  none of which were owned in the company also increased its investment in rotable parts and computer hardware and software  among other items of property and equipment  resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of million in  as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in  as compared to  after including the offsetting amortization associated with manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the increase in total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods for the boeing and lockheed l fleets since such expense varies with that activity  and partly due to the completion of more engine and airframe overhauls between periods for these fleet types 
rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  nine of which were delivered new from the manufacturer between late and late  are not presently generating any engine or airframe overhaul expense since the initial post delivery overhauls for these aircraft are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs decreased million in  as compared to when these early engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
as is more fully explained in note to consolidated financial statements  certain changes in accounting estimates for depreciation have been made by the company 
effective july   the company extended the estimated useful life of the owned lockheed l series and series aircraft to a common retirement date of december  and also reduced the estimated salvage value of the related airframes  engines and rotables 
this change in estimate reduced depreciation expense in by million  as compared to in addition  effective january   the company extended the estimated useful lives of capitalized boeing airframes  engines and improvements  all leasehold improvements  and all rotable parts associated with this fleet  and reduced the associated estimated salvage values 
the effect of this change in estimate was to reduce depreciation expense in by million  as compared to depreciation and amortization expense per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
where the company uses its own employees to perform ground handling functions  the resulting cost appears within salaries  wages and benefits 
air navigation fees are incurred when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased by to million in  as compared to million in the total number of system wide jet departures between and increased by to  from  resulting in approximately million in volume related handling and landing expense increases between periods 
many of these departures were to destinations with significantly higher handling costs and landing fees  and proportionately more such departures were made by wide body l aircraft which incur higher handling and landing costs per departure 
these price and departure mix variances resulted in million more handling and landing costs in than in the company incurred approximately million in higher deicing costs in  as compared with  attributable to the impact of more winter weather on flight operations in than in additionally  the company recorded approximately million in higher cargo handling expenses in  as compared to  due to the acquisition of tg shown associates  inc in january see note to consolidated financial statements 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees increased to cents in  from cents in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for increased to million from million in the company financed four and refinanced one additional boeing aircraft in with operating leases  including two aircraft delivered new from the manufacturer at the end of  and two others delivered in october and november  increasing aircraft rentals expense by million in  as compared to the company also owned nine boeing aircraft during most of which had been financed through operating leases during most of  thereby reducing aircraft rentals expense by million between years 
aircraft rentals cost per asm for was cents  an increase of from cents per asm in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for airframe check and line maintenance activities  and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company expensed a total of maintenance checks on its fleet during  as compared to in the cost of materials consumed and components repaired in association with such checks and other maintenance activity increased by million between and the cost per asm of aircraft maintenance materials decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel is primarily the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crew members incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate company flights throughout the world 
the cost of air transportation is generally more significant for the commercial and military government charter business units since these flights often operate between cities in which company crews are not normally based and may involve extensive international positioning of crews 
hotel and per diem expenses are incurred for scheduled  commercial and military government charter services  although higher per diem and hotel rates generally apply to international assignments 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company s average full time equivalent cockpit and cabin crew employment was higher than in  while jet block hours flown increased by between the same periods 
the company also experienced lower utilization of crew members due to the increase in military business 
the average cost of hotel rooms per full time equivalent crew member increased in  as compared to such hotel costs increased primarily due to higher room rates paid in the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  from cents in ground package cost 
ground package cost is incurred by the company with hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors who provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and ata vacations customers as well as to customers of travel charter and key tours  which were acquired by the company in see note to consolidated financial statements 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of this increase was attributable to the operations of travel charter and key tours in  none of which costs were incurred in the cost per asm of ground packages increased to cents in  as compared to cents in this increase is a result of the acquisition of the tour operators  travel charter and key tours 
passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the onboard costs of meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and in flight movie headsets sold  and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service increased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced a decrease of approximately in the average unit cost of catering each passenger between years  primarily because in there were relatively more scheduled service passengers in the company s business mix  who are provided a less expensive catering product than the company s longer stage length commercial and military government charter passengers 
this resulted in a price and business mix reduction of million in catering expense in  as compared to total jet passengers boarded  however  increased between years  resulting in approximately million in higher volume related catering expenses between the same sets of comparative periods 
the cost per asm of passenger service increased to cents in  as compared to cents in commissions 
the company incurs commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of single seats on scheduled service and ground packages for its tour operator customers 
in addition  the company incurs commissions to secure some commercial and military government charter business 
commissions expense increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the increase in commissions in  as compared to  was attributable to commissions paid to travel agents by travel charter and key tours  which were acquired during the first half of see note to consolidated financial statements 
such commissions were not included in the company s results of operations in scheduled service commissions expense increased by million between and  due to the corresponding increase in commissionable revenues earned between periods 
the company experienced a decrease in fourth quarter commission expenses due to an industry decrease in travel agency commissions paid from to 
commission expense cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised primarily of booking fees paid to computer reservation systems crs  credit card fees incurred when selling single seats and ground packages to customers using credit cards for payment  and toll free telephone service for customers who contact the company directly to book reservations 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service passengers boarded increased between the same periods 
all such selling expenses increased due to growth in the scheduled service and tour operator business units between periods 
other selling cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of air and ground packages 
advertising support for these lines of businesses was increased in  consistent with the company s overall strategy to enhance scheduled service rasm through increases in load factor and yield 
the cost per asm of advertising decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals include the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the growth in facilities costs between periods was attributable to the need to provide facilities at airport locations to support new scheduled service destinations and expanded services at existing destinations 
facility costs also increased million as a result of the acquisition of new business see note to consolidated financial statements 
the cost per asm for facilities and other rentals increased to cents in  as compared to cents in other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in other operating expenses increased primarily due to the cost of passenger air transportation purchased by travel charter and key tours from air carriers other than the company during  none of which was included in the company s results of operation 
other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to changes in the company s capital structure resulting from the sale in december of million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
in december  the company completed an additional sale of million principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
interest expense of million was recorded in for these notes  which was not incurred in the interest expense increase in was partially offset by million due to more interest being capitalized primarily on boeing and lockheed l fleet acquisitions  and million due to the repayment of a note payable secured by a boeing aircraft  which had been outstanding during the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  as compared to million in other non operating income 
the company holds a membership interest in the sita foundation sita  an organization which provides data communication services to the airline industry 
sita s primary asset is its ownership in equant nv equant 
in february and december  sita sold a portion of its interest in equant in a secondary public offering and distributed the pro rata proceeds to certain of its members including amtran  inc that elected to participate in the offering 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of equant shares of million in the first quarter of and a similar gain of million in the fourth quarter of income tax expense 
in the company recorded million in income tax expense applicable to million of pre tax income for that period  while in  income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million

the period to period percentage changes in departures  block hours and passengers boarded were significantly impacted by the operation of ata connection jetstream commuter flights in the twelve months ended december   which operated only during the nine months ended december  such operations in all periods generate comparatively less impact to asms and rpms due to the small seat capacity and short stage length of ata connection propeller aircraft as compared to the company s jet aircraft

in  ground package revenues increased to million  as compared to million in the company s ambassadair travel club offers hundreds of tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members annually 
in  total packages sold decreased as compared to  but the average revenue earned for each ground package sold increased between periods 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled and charter operations of the company 
other revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in in  as compared to  the company earned million more in substitute service revenues  million more in cancellation and administrative fees  and million more in cargo and other affiliate company revenues  partially offset by million less revenue earned from the sale of surplus and obsolete aircraft parts 
a substitute service agreement typically provides for the company to operate aircraft with its crews on routes designated by the customer airline to carry the passengers of that airline for a limited period of time 
the company experienced increased demand for this type of service in due to delays in new aircraft deliveries being encountered by various airlines 
the company also increased its administrative fee for change of reservation on non refundable scheduled service tickets from to per change effective august  and the volume of such fees earned also increased between years in proportion to the increase in scheduled service passengers boarded 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in in creased to million from million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by between and in order to appropriately staff the growth in available seats offered between periods 
categories of employees where this growth was most significant included cockpit and cabin crews  reservations agents  airport passenger and ramp service agents  and aircraft maintenance personnel  all of which are influenced directly by flight activity 
some employment growth in was also needed to correct for certain employee shortages in  particularly in the areas of cockpit crews  reservations agents  and airframe and power plant mechanics 
the average rate of pay earned by the company s employees including all categories of salaries  wages and benefits  except for variable compensation was unchanged between and while most employees received wage rate increases between years  new employees are generally hired at lower average starting rates of pay than those rates in effect for more senior employees 
the wage rate reductions attributable to new employees between and approximately offset the wage rate increases paid to more senior employees 
in  the company recorded million in variable compensation and related payroll taxes as a result of the significant improvement in earnings as compared to  when no such compensation was incurred 
in the second quarter of  a one time charge of million was recorded for variable compensation expense associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer 
salaries  wages and benefits cost per asm increased in to cents  as compared to cents in this unit cost increase was attributable to the faster rate of growth in average equivalent employees between years than seat capacity  and to the variable compensation earned in  which was not earned in fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in this decrease occurred despite the company consuming more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations between years  which resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million 
jet fuel consumption increased primarily due to the increased number of block hours of jet flying operations between periods 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  an increase of between years 
fuel consumption growth between and was less than total block hour growth  however  since most of the block hour growth in was in the narrow body boeing and boeing fleets  which consume approximately of the gallons per block hour consumed by the lockheed l fleet 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed decreased by as compared to  resulting in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years 
this reduction in fuel price was experienced generally in the airline industry throughout as a result of significant reductions in average crude oil and distillate market prices as compared to during the first  second and fourth quarters of  the company entered into several fuel price hedge contracts under which the company sought to reduce the risk of fuel price increases during the year 
the company hedged some fuel consumption under swap agreements which established specific swap prices for designated periods and hedged other fuel consumption under fuel cap agreements which guaranteed a maximum price per gallon for designated periods 
since the price of fuel declined during most of  the company recorded approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense under its hedge contracts  which added approximately one cent to its average cost per gallon in fuel and oil expense decreased to cents per asm in  as compared to cents per asm in  primarily due to the period to period decrease in the average price of fuel consumed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense in creased to million in  as compared to million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and leasehold improvements increased million in  as compared to the company purchased one boeing and one boeing aircraft in late which had been previously financed through operating leases  thereby increasing depreciation expense on airframes between years 
the company recorded a reduction in aircraft rental expense between periods for the termination of operating leases for these aircraft 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses aircraft rentals 
the company also recorded additional inventory obsolescence expense for certain aircraft parts held for sale which were sold during the first quarter of  and increased its investment in rotable parts and computer hardware and software  among other items of property and equipment 
these changes resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of million in  as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in  as compared to  after including the offsetting amortization associated with manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the increase in total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods for the boeing and lockheed l fleets  since such expense varies with that activity  and partly due to the completion of more engine and airframe overhauls between periods for these fleet types 
rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  seven of which were delivered new from the manufacturer between late and late  are not presently generating any engine or airframe overhaul expense since the initial post delivery overhauls for these aircraft are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs increased million in as compared to when these early engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
effective july   the company extended the estimated useful life of the owned lockheed l series and series aircraft to a common retirement date of december  and also reduced the estimated salvage value of the related airframes  engines and rotables 
the effect of this change in estimate was to reduce depreciation expense in by million  as compared to depreciation and amortization expense per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased by to million in  as compared to million in the total number of system wide jet departures between and increased by to  from  resulting in approximately million in volume related handling and landing expense increases between periods 
this volume related increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease of approximately million in price and mix related handling and landing expenses for  as compared to  attributable primarily to a change in jet departure mix 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees decreased to cents in  from cents in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for decreased to million from million in the company purchased one leased boeing in september  returned one leased boeing to the lessor in november of  and added one new leased boeing each in december and august these fleet changes resulted in a reduction in boeing rentals expense of million in  as compared to aircraft rentals expense for the boeing and lockheed l fleets did not change significantly between years 
aircraft rentals cost per asm for was cents  a decrease of from cents per asm in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company performed a total of light airframe checks on its fleet during  as compared to such checks performed in  an increase of between years 
the cost of materials consumed and components repaired in association with such light checks and other maintenance activity increased by million between and the cost per asm of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in crew and other employee travel 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company s average full time equivalent cockpit and cabin crew employment was higher than in  while jet block hours flown increased by between the same periods 
the average cost of hotel rooms per full time equivalent crew member increased in  as compared to such hotel costs increased due to both higher room rates paid in  and due to aircraft flow changes associated with the company s summer schedule which resulted in more crews terminating their daily flying away from their home bases than in the prior year 
the average cost of crew positioning per full time equivalent crew member decreased in  as compared to crew positioning costs declined primarily due to the shift of revenue production from commercial charter and military government charter to scheduled service 
crews positioning out of base for scheduled service can often position at no cost on company flights  whereas positioning to remote international locations for charter service is usually done on other carriers at an incremental cost 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in ground package cost 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in the number of ambassadair ground packages sold in decreased  as compared to  while the average cost of ambassadair ground packages sold increased by between years 
the number of ata vacations ground packages sold in decreased as compared to  while the average cost of ata vacations ground packages sold decreased by between the same periods 
the cost per asm of ground packages decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in passenger service 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service increased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced a decrease of approximately in the average unit cost of catering each passenger between years  primarily because in there were relatively more scheduled service passengers in the company s business mix who are provided a less expensive catering product than the company s longer stage length commercial and military government charter passengers 
this resulted in a price and business mix reduction of million in catering expense in  as compared to total jet passengers boarded  however  increased between years  resulting in approximately million in higher volume related catering expenses between the same sets of comparative periods 
the cost per asm of passenger service declined to cents in from cents in commissions 
commissions expense increased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service commissions expense increased by million between and this increase was lower than the related increase of in scheduled service revenues between the same periods  partially because of an industry wide reduction in the standard travel agency commission rate from to which became effective in october  and partially due to relatively more non commissionable bulk seat scheduled service sales being made in  as compared to neither commercial charter nor military government charter commissions expense changed significantly between and the cost per asm of commissions expense was unchanged at cents for both and other selling expenses 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service passengers boarded increased between the same periods 
crs fees increased million in  as compared to  due to a increase in total crs bookings made for the expanded scheduled service business unit between periods and due to a increase in the average cost of each crs booking 
toll free telephone costs increased million between and  primarily due to higher toll free usage related to higher scheduled service reservations activity 
credit card fees increased million in  as compared to  due to higher earned revenues in scheduled service which were sold using credit cards as payment 
other selling cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase in total advertising expense between years was slightly greater than the increase in scheduled service revenues between the same periods 
the majority of the company s growth in was from increased frequencies at existing gateway cities such as chicago midway  which provided some advertising efficiencies in as compared to the prior year 
such market related efficiency was partially offset  however  due to temporarily higher advertising support required in the second and third quarters of for the introduction of the company s new services to dallas ft 
worth  denver  san juan and new york s laguardia airport  as well as to launch the company s fall promotions in the third and fourth quarters of the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals include the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in the rate of growth in facilities costs between periods was comparable to the rate of asm growth between and due to the addition of new facilities for services to denver  dallas ft 
worth and new york s laguardia airport between periods 
the cost per asm for facility and other rentals was unchanged at cents in both and other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in other operating expenses which experienced significant changes between periods included i million of additional costs for the chicago express jetstream code share agreement  which agreement was not in effect in the first quarter  and because such code share was expanded to include lansing and madison in  which were served in only the fourth quarter of  ii million in higher expenses associated with the operation of the company s affiliate businesses  and iii million in higher costs associated with the short term leasing of substitute aircraft and the reprotection of some of the company s passengers on other airlines due to higher than normal delayed and irregular flight operations  primarily in the second quarter of other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to changes in the company s capital structure resulting from the two financings completed on july   at which time the company i sold million principal amount of unsecured seven year notes  and ii entered into a new million secured revolving credit facility  thereby replacing the former secured revolving credit facility of million as of june  additionally  in december  the company sold million principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
prior to completing these new financings  the company utilized secured bank credit facilities to finance cash flow requirements of the company as they arose  thereby minimizing the level of borrowings on which interest would be paid 
during  the company s weighted average debt outstanding was approximately million  as compared to million in the weighted average effective interest rate applicable to the company s outstanding debt in was  as compared to in the increase in the weighted average effective interest rates between years was primarily due to the interest rate applicable to the million in unsecured notes issued on july   which was higher than the average interest rate which was applicable to borrowings under the former credit facility 
the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  as compared to million in income tax expense 
in the company recorded million in income tax expense applicable to million of pre tax income for that period  while in  income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million 
the effective tax rate applicable to was  as compared to in income tax expense in both sets of comparative periods was affected by the permanent non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of a percentage of amounts paid for crew per diem in and in 
the effect of this and other permanent differences on the effective income tax rate for financial accounting purposes becomes more pronounced in cases where before tax income approaches zero  which was a significant reason for the higher effective tax rate in income tax expense for was also significantly affected by the one time million charge to salaries  wages and benefits for the executive compensation package provided to the company s former president and chief executive officer 
of the total compensation paid to this former executive of the company in  approximately million was non deductible against the company s federal taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
in  and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities between periods was attributable to such factors as increased earnings  higher depreciation and amortization  higher accrued expenses and other factors 
these increases were offset by higher investments in inventories and receivables  and a lower amount of income tax deferred in  as the company utilized all remaining net operating loss carryforwards from earlier tax years 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in the years ended december   and such amounts primarily included capital expenditures totaling million  million and million  respectively  for engine and airframe overhauls  airframe improvements  hushkit installations  the purchase of rotable parts  and for purchase deposits made on boeing and lockheed l aircraft scheduled for future delivery 
included in capital expenditures for were approximately million for the purchase of nine boeing aircraft that were previously leased and approximately million for the purchase and modification of five lockheed l aircraft 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
this cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from long term debt of million in consisting of a million principal amount of unsecured senior notes  a million special facility revenue bond and a million note payable  as compared to million for consisting of a million principal amount of unsecured senior notes and a million special facility revenue bond 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
these proceeds were offset by payments on long term debt of million in for certain monthly installment payments  as compared to million in  for items such as million repayment on the revolving bank credit facility  million repayment of a note payable and million for other repayments 
these cash inflows were also offset by cash outflows for the purchase of treasury stock of million and million  respectively  in and cash provided by financing activities in of million were primarily from the million principal amount of unsecured notes  which were offset by the full repayment of the former credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk resulting from aircraft fuel price fluctuations and interest rate risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel 
the company s results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
during  aircraft fuel accounted for approximately of the company s operating expenses 
based on the company s projected fuel consumption  a one cent change in the average annual price per gallon of aircraft fuel would impact the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately million 
the company s short term risk is mitigated by contractual fuel price escalators contained in military charter and commercial charter contracts  which enable the company to pass through some increases in fuel cost 
the company has previously entered into certain fuel swap contracts and fuel cap agreements 
no such agreements are in place as of december  interest rates 
the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in market interest rates 
as of december   the company has approximately million of variable rate debt available through a revolving credit facility 
in  the company does not project to incur significant borrowings under the facility  so the risk of exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
as of december   the company had fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million 
based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments  the fair value of the fixed rate debt is estimated at approximately million 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december if average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately million during part ii continued
