seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with the largest percentage of net income  us sales  and substantially all revenues generated from high cascade realized in the first fiscal quarter june through august  the back to school selling months 
as the company increases sales to europe due to the european conversion  the company is recognizing more of such sales in the first fiscal quarter due to seasonal demand for product in europe 
in addition  because snowboarding is a winter sport  sales of the company s snowboard boots  and the switch autolock r system  have historically been strongest in the first and second fiscal quarters 
such sales are now being recognized earlier in the first fiscal quarter since industry retailers are demanding earlier shipments of product 
in addition to seasonal fluctuations  the company s operating results fluctuate quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of holidays  weather  timing of shipments  product mix  cost of materials and the mix between wholesale and retail channels 
because of such fluctuations  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts

euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established a fixed conversion rate between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  and adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date the euro conversion 
existing currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries until january  during the transition period  parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the existing currency  but retailers are not required to accept the euro as payment 
since the company primarily does business in us dollars  it is currently not anticipated that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on its business or financial condition 
the company is aware that the information systems for its six european stores are not currently able to recognize the euro conversion  however  since three of the company s european stores are located in the united kingdom  which is not currently participating in the euro conversion  and the spain and austria stores may continue to accept local currencies until  the company does not expect its current overall european store operations to be materially adversely impacted by the euro conversion in the near future 
the company has confirmed that the information systems utilized by its european sales agents recognize the euro conversion  and all of its european distributors have represented to the company that their systems do the same 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations 
the revolver bears interest at a rate equal to either i libor plus a margin  or ii a base rate plus a margin 
the margins are based on the company s rate of funded debt to ebitda  each as defined in the credit agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest rate risks 
foreign currency risk the company operates its business and sells its products in a number of countries throughout the world and  as a result  is exposed to movements on foreign currency exchange rates 
although the company has most of its products manufactured outside of the united states on a per order basis  these purchases are made in us dollars 
the major foreign currency exposures involve japan and europe 
in order to protect against the volatility associated with earnings currency translations of foreign subsidiaries and royalty income from sources outside the united states  the company may  from time to time  utilize forward foreign exchange contracts and or foreign currency options with durations of generally three to twelve months 
as of may   the company had no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts 
note this is a forward looking statement regarding the currencies in which the company does business 
the company s actual results regarding the euro conversion could differ materially if the company begins to accept currencies other than the us dollar
