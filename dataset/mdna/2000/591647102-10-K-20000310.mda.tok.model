overview metrocall is a leading provider of local  regional and national paging and other wireless messaging services 
through its nationwide wireless network  metrocall provides messaging services to over  us cities  including the top smsas 
since  metrocall s subscriber base has increased from less than  to more than million 
metrocall has achieved this growth through a combination of internal growth and a program of mergers and acquisitions 
as of december   metrocall was the third largest messaging company in the united states based on the number of subscribers 
metrocall derives a majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic usually monthly fees  generally not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging and wireless messaging services 
while a subscriber continues to use its services  operating results benefit from this recurring stream with minimal requirements for incremental selling expenses or fixed costs 
metrocall has grown internally by broadening its distribution network and expanding its target market to capitalize on the growing appeal of messaging and other wireless products and services  to gain access to different market segments and to increase the penetration and utilization of its nationwide network 
since december   metrocall has added approximately million new subscribers through internal growth 
over the past three years  metrocall has emphasized a number of distribution channels that are characterized by lower arpu  such as resellers  and correspondingly lower operating costs 
to offset declines in arpu and to capitalize on the growth of paging and other wireless messaging services  metrocall has expanded its channels of distribution to include  among others  company owned and operated retail outlets  strategic partnerships and alliances  internet sales  with each distribution channel focusing on the sale rather than the lease of pagers 
some of these channels tend to have higher arpu s than metrocall s strategic partners and typical resellers  who purchase service in quantity at wholesale rates 
furthermore  metrocall has been successful in marketing enhanced services  such as nationwide paging services  voice mail and other ancillary services for its strategic partners and other alliances 
metrocall has also grown significantly through mergers and acquisitions 
since july  metrocall has added approximately million subscribers to its subscriber base through mergers and acquisitions through december  acquisition number of acquired company date subscribers parkway july   satellite august   a network november   page america july   pronet december   amd october   total  metrocall believes that its enhanced nationwide coverage gives it a competitive advantage in gaining additional subscribers 
in february  metrocall agreed to acquire nationpage  inc in a stock purchase transaction with a subsidiary of at t corp 
this acquisition will add approximately  subscribers located principally in eastern pennsylvania  new jersey and upstate new york 
metrocall believes that the paging and wireless messaging industry is likely to undergo additional consolidation and has announced that it intends to participate in the consolidation process 
potential future consolidations would be evaluated on several key operating and financial elements including geographic presence  fcc regulatory licenses held  overall valuation of potential target  including subscriber base and potential synergies  consideration to be given  potential increase to free cash flow and operating cash flow  and  availability of financing and the ability to reduce the combined companies long term debt 
any potential transaction may result in substantial capital requirements for which additional financing may be required 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing would be available on terms satisfactory to metrocall 
in november  arch and pagenet announced that they had agreed to merge 
completion of this merger is subject to a number of conditions  including agreement by holders of pagenet s outstanding senior unsecured notes to exchange their notes for arch common stock 
metrocall has had and may continue to have informal discussions with certain holders of these notes about whether metrocall might be able to present an alternative to the arch merger 
metrocall has not made any offer with respect to pagenet  and there is no assurance that metrocall will make any such proposal or that the proposal would be successful 
metrocall also engages  from time to time  in discussions with other industry participants about potential consolidation transactions 
again  there can be no assurance that any such discussion will lead to a consolidation transaction 
metrocall s growth  whether internal or through consolidation  requires significant capital investment for messaging equipment and technical infrastructure 
metrocall also purchases pagers and messaging devices for that portion of its subscriber base to which it leases pagers and messaging devices 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled approximately million  which included approximately million for subscribers equipment  representing increases in pagers and messaging devices on hand and net increases and maintenance to the pager and messaging base 
metrocall estimates capital expenditures for the year ending december  will approximate million  primarily for paging and messaging equipment  transmission equipment and information system enhancements

results of operations the definitions below will be helpful in understanding the discussion of metrocall s results of operations 
service  rent and maintenance revenues include primarily monthly  quarterly  semi annually and annually billed recurring revenue  not generally dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging and related services such as voice mail and pager repair and replacement 
service  rent and maintenance revenues also include revenues derived from cellular and long distance services

year ended december  compared with december  the following table sets forth the amount of revenues and the percentage of net revenues defined as total revenues less the net book value of products sold represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of revenues revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    product sales    total revenues    net book value of products sold    net revenues    arpu number of subscribers    service  rent and maintenance revenues 
service  rent and maintenance revenues increased approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was due to the  increase in the number of subscribers receiving metrocall s paging and other wireless messaging services which was generated through internal growth during and the million subscribers acquired in the amd acquisition in october metrocall s average service  rent and maintenance revenue per unit arpu for paging and messaging services increased from per unit in to per unit 
this increase was primarily the result of the high premium  value added service characteristics of the subscribers acquired in the amd acquisition  for which metrocall provided services for an entire year in service  rent and maintenance revenues also increased due to the continued migration of subscribers to alphanumeric paging devices and selected rate increases partially offset by a reduction in subscribers in direct distribution channels and growth in the strategic alliances and reseller indirect distribution channels  which are characterized by lower arpu and lower operating costs 
although metrocall s revenue increased during  the change in its subscriber mix during the year benefited the indirect distribution channels  which are characterized by lower arpus 
metrocall expects that revenues and arpu may be affected by a full year s impact of the factors described above as well as continued competitive pressures within its industry 
in  metrocall will introduce two way messaging services primarily within its direct distribution channels 
metrocall expects that this product service may generate higher arpu than its current services 
metrocall does not expect a significant revenue impact from the new two way services in the first half of based on current product availability estimates 
product sales revenues 
product sales revenues increased approximately million from million to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in the increase in product sales was the result of the operations of amd being included in metrocall s operations for a full fiscal year 
net book value of products sold increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in on november  metrocall completed the sale of its electronic tracking business 
product sales revenues generated from this business were only recognized through october product sales attributable to the electronic tracking business were approximately million through october   which represented a decrease of approximately  in from the twelve months ended december  the following tables set forth the amounts of operating expenses and related percentages of net revenues represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of operating expenses revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    selling and marketing    general and administrative    depreciation    amortization    operating expenses per unit in service increase or decrease monthly service  rent and maintenance monthly selling and marketing monthly general and administrative average monthly operating expense overall  in  metrocall experienced an increase in its historical average monthly operating expense per unit in service operating expenses per unit before depreciation and amortization of per unit 
the increase in the unit cost was primarily attributable to additional operating expenses incurred by the operations of amd  which was acquired on october  at the time of the acquisition  amd average monthly operating costs per unit had ranged between and per unit over a base of approximately million subscribers 
this average cost per unit was significantly above the average cost per unit incurred by metrocall on its million unit subscriber base for the nine month period through september  metrocall was able to minimize the cost impact of amd s operations on metrocall s operating results through its integration efforts 
as metrocall integrated amd operations into its own structure  metrocall was able to achieve over million of synergies in its integration of amd and reduce the amount of expenses incurred through amd s operations by converting a portion of amd s customers onto metrocall s network  which reduced third party paging service costs and increased network utilization and from the elimination of duplicative amd functions such as executive staffing  finance and other positions 
metrocall has substantially completed its integration efforts however continues to migrate existing amd customers onto its network 
service  rent and maintenance expenses 
service  rent and maintenance expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in approximately million of this increase was the result of expenses incurred by the operations of amd  which was acquired in october and therefore not included in metrocall s operating results until the fourth quarter of the expenses incurred were comprised primarily of third party dispatching  telecommunications expenses and tower site rents 
monthly service  rent and maintenance expense per unit of in has decreased per unit from in service  rent and maintenance expenses have decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to a decrease in telecommunication expenses as a result of renegotiated telecommunications contracts  deconstruction of redundant tower sites and other cost reduction initiatives 
metrocall expects that its service  rent and maintenance expenses for its traditional paging services may be flat in and may increase due to service costs related to providing two way messaging services as metrocall expands its two way message services and incurs additional costs associated with operating leases for two way messaging equipment 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and remained flat as a percentage of net revenues at 
approximately million of the increase in selling and marketing expenses was attributable to increased personnel costs related to the acquired amd sales force 
exclusive of the amd acquisition  selling and marketing expenses have increased as a result of an increase in the sales force in existing markets 
monthly selling and marketing costs per unit increased was a result of the events described above 
selling and marketing expenses may increase in future periods as a percentage of net revenues as metrocall continues to increase and intensify its competitive presence in existing markets and launches its two way messaging services

increase or other decrease interest and other income net interest expense    income tax benefit    net loss    preferred dividends    gain on series b repurchase   ebitda    interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in of approximately million was the result of higher average debt balances outstanding during the fiscal year 
total debt increased million from million in to million in average debt balances were million greater in than in as a result of debt incurred in connection with the amd acquisition in october  the repurchase of the series b preferred in january and working capital requirements 
income tax benefit 
the increase in the income tax benefit in of approximately million was the result of a full year s impact of the tax benefit recorded on the amortization of non goodwill related intangible assets generated from the amd acquisition 
net loss 
metrocall s net loss increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in net loss was primarily the result of the increase in depreciation  amortization and interest expenses in offset by the increase in ebitda 
preferred dividends 
the increase in preferred dividends of million was the result of higher dividends paid to the holders of the series a preferred due to the compounding nature of the preferred stock and a full year s dividend distribution to the holder of the series c preferred 
these dividend payments were offset by the impact of the repurchase of the series b preferred  which occurred in january subsequent to december   at t wireless agreed to exchange the series c preferred for common stock 
assuming this transaction is consummated  no dividends on the series c preferred will be incurred after december  in addition  one holder of series a preferred has surrendered shares of series a preferred in payment for the exercise of warrants  which will reduce the amount of dividends that will accrue on the series a preferred in future periods

service  rent and maintenance revenues increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to the growth in metrocall s subscriber base 
in  metrocall added approximately  subscribers or through internal growth and added approximately million subscribers or through the amd acquisition 
also in  metrocall s service  rent and maintenance revenues included those revenues generated from the million subscriber base acquired in the december  pronet merger for which no revenues were recognized during and the million subscribers acquired from the amd acquisition on october  the decline in monthly arpu of per unit from to was attributable to metrocall s subscriber distribution mix and the related increase in the lower arpu indirect reseller distribution channel 
the decline in arpu was partially offset by the increase in the rental base due to the amd acquisition  which was characterized with high revenue rental subscribers 
product sales revenues 
product sales revenues increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in net book value of products sold increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in the increase in product sales revenues was directly attributable to higher unit sales and greater geographic penetration related to the pronet merger and the amd acquisition 
the following tables set forth the amounts of operating expenses and related percentages of net revenues represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of operating expenses revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    selling and marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    separating expenses per unit in service decrease monthly service  rent and maintenance monthly selling and marketing monthly general and administrative average monthly operating costs overall in  metrocall experienced a reduction of per unit in average monthly operating expense per unit 
as discussed below  metrocall s operating results in included the operating expenses of page america and pronet for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the operating results include the operating expenses of amd from the october  acquisition date 
each operating expense is discussed separately below service  rent and maintenance expenses 
service  rent and maintenance expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in service  rent and maintenance expenses increased in because they included the service  rent and maintenance expenses of page america and pronet for a complete fiscal year million and the expenses of amd for the fourth quarter of million 
exclusive of the impact of the pronet merger and the page america and amd acquisitions  service  rent and maintenance expenses in remained relatively flat compared to expenses with increases in tower rents and network repairs and maintenance expenses being partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the divesture of metrocall s telemessaging operations in for which no expenses were recognized in average monthly service  rent and maintenance expense per unit slightly declined in as a result of the higher average subscriber base throughout selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in selling and marketing expenses increased in because they included the selling and marketing expenses of page america and pronet for a complete fiscal year million and the expenses of amd for the fourth quarter of million 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues in was primarily from the impact of recent merger and acquisitions and the related higher revenues base 
average monthly selling and marketing expense per unit declined in as a result of the higher average subscriber base throughout general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in general and administrative expenses increased in because they included the general and administrative expenses of page america and pronet for a complete fiscal year million and the expenses of amd for the fourth quarter of million 
exclusive of the impact of the merger and acquisitions  general and administrative expenses increased for a variety of professional services million and additional operating personnel million 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in was primarily from the benefit of economies of scale related to recent merger and acquisitions and the related increase in the revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in total depreciation expense in was approximately million and resulted primarily from depreciation on additional subscriber paging equipment and other plant and equipment acquired mainly in the pronet merger and page america and amd acquisitions 
the increase in total amortization expense in was approximately million and resulted primarily from amortization expenses on intangibles acquired in metrocall s recent merger and acquisitions and the reduction in estimated useful lives of certain intangibles described below 
effective january   metrocall reduced the estimated useful lives of certain intangibles  including goodwill  regulatory licenses issued by the fcc and subscriber bases recorded in conjunction with acquisitions from years to years for goodwill  from years to years for fcc licenses and from years for subscriber bases to years 
the impact of these changes was to increase amortization expense in by approximately million 
the following table indicates the recorded balances of certain intangible assets  by acquisition  held by metrocall at december   immediately before the change in amortization period for these assets 
fcc subscriber acquisition acquisition date goodwill licenses base parkway july     satellite august     a network november     page america july    pronet december     other acquisitions    metrocall reduced the period of amortization for amounts allocated to goodwill from to years to years for each of its acquisitions because of the effects of technological and competitive pressures that had impacted the industry and that were expected to continue 
for instance  during late and early  technological developments occurred with respect to advanced messaging devices and products  which would compete against the traditional paging businesses that metrocall had acquired in and accordingly  metrocall believed that the estimated useful life of the underlying goodwill recorded from its acquisitions was shortened due to these technological developments an the risks of increased competition and marketing pressures on its traditional paging business 
metrocall also reduced the number of years it amortized the balances of its subscriber bases acquired with each acquisition because of the continued and heightened competitive pressures that it had experienced and that were evident in the one way paging industry and the technological developments in the industry that it believed would create new products and services  which would compete with metrocall s paging services 
metrocall believes the revision in its estimated lives was necessary to ensure that the recorded balances of these intangible assets and the change to a ten year amortization period for goodwill and three year amortization period for its subscriber bases appropriately match the value and future benefits of these assets 
metrocall also reduced the period that it amortized amounts paid for fcc licenses from years to years as a result of the new fcc auction rules and other regulatory changes that occurred during and early the revised amortization period now matches the years fcc holding period to the fcc initial holding period for these licenses because of the effects of the increased competition in the license auction process  the site build out requirements imposed on newly awarded licenses and the trade in provisions for wide area licenses all of which could limit the period of time that metrocall holds a specific license 
other increase interest and other income  net interest expense    income tax benefit    net loss    preferred dividends    ebitda    interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in of approximately million was the result of higher average debt balances outstanding during the fiscal year primarily associated with the additional debt assumed with the pronet merger and financing requirements of the amd acquisition 
during  total debt increased by million to million 
income tax benefit 
the increase in the income tax benefit in of approximately million was the result of the tax benefit recorded on the amortization of non goodwill related intangible assets primarily generated from the pronet merger which occurred on december  for which no tax benefits were generated in and the amd acquisition which occurred on october  net loss 
metrocall s net loss increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in net loss was primarily the result of increased depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses associated with the pronet merger and the page america and amd acquisitions offset by increases in net revenues related to an increase in the subscriber base as a result of internal growth and recent merger and acquisitions 
preferred dividends 
the increase in preferred dividends in of approximately million was the result of higher dividends paid to the holders of the series a preferred and the series b preferred in and dividends paid in the fourth quarter of to the holder of the series c preferred 
dividends recognized on the series a preferred and the series b preferred increased by million and million  respectively due to their cumulative nature 
on october   metrocall issued  shares of the series c preferred in connection with the amd acquisition 
dividends recognized on the series c preferred were approximately million 
ebitda 
the increase in ebitda in of approximately million was primarily the result of the increase in revenues in offset to a lesser extent by the increase in operating expenses 
ebitda margin improved from in to in inflation inflation is presently not a material factor affecting metrocall s business 
traditional one way paging system equipment and operating costs have not increased and one way pager costs have declined significantly in recent years 
this reduction in costs has been reflected in lower prices charged to our subscribers 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to inflationary pressures 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended december   metrocall s operations have required significant funding  primarily to support mergers and acquisitions and capital expenditures for paging and messaging infrastructure and equipment requirements 
metrocall has met its funding requirements with cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from its senior subordinated notes offerings 
cash flows 
metrocall s net cash flows from operating activities increased approximately million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to the increase in ebitda offset by an increase in interest expense for the twelve month period ended december  the remaining million increase was primarily the result of improvements in metrocall s working capital position at december  net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million or from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  the net decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in cash required for business acquisitions in  partially offset by increases in capital expenditures 
during  metrocall acquired amd for a purchase price of million including cash of million 
there were no similar acquisition events in in addition  capital expenditures increased by million in the twelve months ended december   which was attributable to internal subscriber growth  and capital requirements for amd operations  which was acquired in october capital expenditures in included approximately million for subscriber equipment  representing increases of devices on hand and net increases to the rental subscriber base 
the balance of capital expenditures was primarily for network and infrastructure development and information systems and computer related equipment 
total capital expenditures for fiscal year are expected to approximate million 
during  metrocall also sold the assets of its electronic tracking business for approximately million  which included net cash proceeds of million 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately million from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  during fiscal year  metrocall borrowed an additional million under its credit facility primarily to fund the million repurchase of the series b preferred and other working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
metrocall also used the cash proceeds received in the sale of its electronic tracking business to reduce outstanding bank borrowings 
during  cash provided by financing activities included net borrowings of approximately million  which was primarily used to fund the million cash acquisition cost of amd and general working capital requirements 
working capital 
metrocall s working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities deficit improved by million from a deficit of million at december  to million at december  the improvement in working capital was the result of an increase in accounts receivable  primarily the result of an increase in revenues  and decreases in cash and accounts payable balances primarily related to the timing of payments to metrocall s vendors for its operating expenses 
long term debt 
at december  and  long term debt consisted of increase long term debt or decrease borrowings under the credit facility    senior subordinated notes   capital leases and other debt   total long term debt    borrowings and repayments under the credit facility 
during  net borrowings under the credit facility increased by million  which represented gross borrowings of million  net of repayments of million 
approximately million of the net borrowings were used to repurchase the series b preferred and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
of the million repaid  approximately million was from the proceeds received from the sale of the electronic tracking business and million was from cash generated from operating activities 
subject to certain conditions set forth in its credit facility agreement  as amended  metrocall may borrow up to million under two loan facilities through december  the first facility facility a is a million reducing revolving credit facility and the second facility b is a million reducing term credit 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of metrocall s assets 
required quarterly principal repayments  as defined  begin on march  and continue through december  under the credit facility  metrocall is required to comply with financial and operating covenants 
it is required to maintain certain financial ratios  including total debt to annualized operating cash flow  senior debt to annualized operating cash flow  annualized operating cash flow to pro forma debt service  total sources of cash to total uses of cash  and operating cash flow to interest expense in each case  as such terms are defined in the credit facility agreement 
the covenants also limit additional indebtedness and future mergers and acquisitions without the approval of the lenders and restrict the payment of cash dividends and other stockholder distributions by metrocall 
the credit facility agreement also prohibits certain changes in ownership control of metrocall  as defined 
at december   metrocall was in compliance with all of these covenants 
at december  based on the terms of its financial and operating covenants  metrocall had million available under its credit facility  which represents the entire undrawn amount 
under the credit facility  metrocall will be required to apply of the net proceeds of the equity investments by psinet  aether and hmtf  or approximately million  to a permanent reduction of the facility a and facility b commitments 
metrocall has requested its bank group to waive this requirement and to make certain other amendments to the credit facility  including extension of the maturity and amortization periods of the loans  modification of leverage covenants  and approval of the establishment of inciscent 
metrocall expects to complete these amendments  subject to bank approval  by march  as described above  in february  metrocall entered into agreements to issue new equity for approximately million 
in addition  metrocall has issued an option to hmtf to purchase additional shares that  if exercised  would yield an additional million 
metrocall expects to use the proceeds of these equity issuances to reduce outstanding debt  either by repayments of outstanding loans under the credit facility or repurchase of subordinated debt 
metrocall may also seek to reduce leverage and interest expense by offering to exchange common stock for its outstanding subordinated debt 
access to future capital 
metrocall s ability to access borrowings under its credit facility and to meet its debt service and other obligations including compliance with financial covenants will be dependent upon its future performance and cash flows from operations 
these dependencies will be subject to financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond metrocall s control  such as prevailing economic conditions 
metrocall cannot assure you that  in the event it were to require additional financing  such additional financing would be available on terms permitted by agreements relating to existing indebtedness or otherwise satisfactory to it 
metrocall believes that funds generated by its operations  together with those available under its credit facility  will be sufficient to finance estimated capital expenditure requirements and to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
risk factors risks to the business metrocall s business might be adversely affected by factors beyond its control 
metrocall believes that its future operating results and funds generated from operations and available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet general corporate requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
metrocall however cannot identify nor can it control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect its business and results of operations 
some of the circumstances that may occur and may impair metrocall s business are described below 
if any of the following circumstances were to occur  metrocall s business  financial conditions or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
operating losses metrocall has a history of operating losses and expects to continue to incur operating losses in the future 
as a result  metrocall may not be able to meet its cash needs from operations or pay debt obligations 
metrocall historically has had operating losses and expects these losses to continue 
these losses make it more difficult for it to meet its cash and other working capital needs  to support its business operations and to pay its debt obligations as they become due because metrocall must rely on its ability to obtain financing or generate additional revenues 
the losses have resulted because metrocall has focused mainly on its consolidation and growth strategies and its capital expenditure requirements  instead of focusing mainly on current earnings 
metrocall has sustained net losses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and at december   metrocall s accumulated deficit was approximately million and its working capital deficit was million 
metrocall expects to continue to incur losses from operations in the future because it expenses significant amounts for depreciation expenses from capital expenditures and amortization expenses related to intangible assets recorded on acquisitions 
in addition  metrocall has substantial levels of borrowing  which cause significant interest expense  expected to be outstanding in the foreseeable future 
metrocall cannot assure you that it can reverse operating losses and achieve profitability in the future and that it will be able to meet all of its cash and other working capital needs from operations in the future 
ability to cover fixed charges metrocall s earnings have historically been insufficient to cover fixed charges and as a result metrocall might need to borrow additional amounts in the future 
in previous fiscal years  metrocall s earnings have been insufficient to cover fixed charges 
fixed charges  as well as capital expenditure requirements and other interest expense obligations  may cause metrocall to borrow additional amounts in the future 
fixed charges primarily include interest expenses related to its long term debt 
the insufficient amount of earnings is primarily attributable to metrocall s history of significant net losses 
the chart below shows the extent to which fixed charges exceed earnings 
year ended december  dollars in thousands amount of fixed charges      deficiency of earnings to fixed charges      in addition to the amount required to cover its fixed charges  metrocall s business requires substantial funds for capital expenditures for paging and other wireless messaging equipment and for payment of significant interest expenses associated with its substantial levels of borrowings 
the substantial amount of funds associated with metrocall s business may require it to incur additional borrowing from time to time 
substantial amount of indebtedness metrocall s substantial amount of indebtedness could adversely affect its business operations  limit its ability to use debt to fund future capital needs and prevent metrocall from meeting its obligations under its debt instruments 
metrocall has a substantial amount of indebtedness 
the following chart forth sets forth important credit information at december  dollars in thousands total indebtedness  less cash balances of   fourth quarter ended annualized operating cash flow  leverage ratio to stockholders equity deficit  debt to equity ratio to metrocall s substantial amount of indebtedness  along with the net operating losses and working capital deficits it has sustained in recent periods  could adversely affect its business 
for example  it may make it more difficult for metrocall to satisfy its debt obligations  require metrocall to dedicate a substantial portion of its operating cash flows from operations to pay interest expense  limit its ability to react to changing market conditions  changes in its industry and economic downturns  place metrocall at a competitive disadvantage with respect to its ability to finance future acquisitions or capital expenditures compared to its competitors that have less debt  limit its ability to borrow additional funds  and cause metrocall to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates because a substantial amount of its indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at floating rates  only a portion of which is hedged 
metrocall s credit facility agreement and other debt allows it to incur more debt 
as of december   metrocall was permitted to borrow an additional million 
further borrowings could increase these risks 
metrocall s operating and financial restrictions metrocall s debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions 
if metrocall fails to comply with these restrictions  the holders of the debt could demand that metrocall pay them immediately 
metrocall s debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions 
if metrocall fails to comply with these restrictions  it would be in default under the debt agreements and holders of the debt could demand immediate payment 
if the debt holders were to demand immediate payment  metrocall could not assure you that it would be able to pay or refinance the debt on acceptable terms to metrocall 
in addition  if metrocall fails to comply with a restriction in its credit facility  the lenders under that credit facility could proceed against the assets of metrocall  which metrocall pledged to the lenders as collateral for the payment of the debt 
the restrictions in the debt agreements significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  metrocall s ability to incur additional debt and particular types of debt  pay cash dividends  repurchase or redeem its capital stock  make investments or other payments  create security interests  engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates  sell assets  issue or sell stock of subsidiaries  and merge or consolidate with other companies 
in addition  metrocall must comply with financial ratios in its credit facility and the restrictions imposed by its preferred stock 
metrocall cannot assure you that it will be able to meet these financial ratios and restrictions in the future 
intangible assets most of metrocall s assets are intangible assets whose value may decrease from factors beyond metrocall s control 
if the value of those assets were to decrease and metrocall were required to satisfy its debt obligations based on its assets value 
metrocall might not be able to satisfy those debt obligations 
most of metrocall s assets are intangible assets  primarily fcc licenses and certificates  goodwill  subscriber lists and deferred financing costs 
at december   metrocall s total assets were approximately  million  of which net intangible assets were approximately million 
if metrocall was required to satisfy its obligations under its credit facility because  for example  it defaulted under its debt agreements  became insolvent or was liquidated  and their lenders under the credit facility proceeded against metrocall s assets to satisfy those obligations  the value of its assets might not be sufficient to satisfy those obligations 
the reason the value of metrocall s assets might be insufficient is because the value of intangible assets could be impaired by factors beyond metrocall s control  such as changes in technology  regulation  and available financing or competitive pressures 
metrocall cannot assure you that the value of its assets is or will be sufficient to repay its debt obligations under the credit facility 
additional competition due to technological developments technological developments could lead to increased competition to metrocall 
future technological developments in the wireless communications industry  such as narrowband pcs and broadband pcs  could create new services or products that compete with metrocall s paging and wireless messaging services 
that increased competition might result in loss of existing or future subscribers  loss of revenues and increase in expenses to stay competitive 
developments in narrowband pcs  which provides advanced messaging capabilities  could lead to increased competition 
some of metrocall s largest competitors in the traditional paging market have narrowband pcs licenses  which permit them to provide advanced messaging services on a nationwide basis 
metrocall expects other companies to offer advanced messaging services and  as a result  metrocall s growth in terms of subscriber base might be impaired 
metrocall intends to offer two way and continue providing other advanced messaging services through its weblink alliance in early  but the success of offering these services depends on several factors 
those factors include market acceptance  cost of equipment and other capital requirements  technological changes in wireless messaging services  competitors marketing and sales strategies  regulatory developments and general economic conditions 
these factors are beyond metrocall s control 
metrocall cannot assure you that its offering of these services will be beneficial to its business operations or financial condition 
further developments of broadband pcs could also lead to increased competition 
many companies now provide wireless telephone service using broadband pcs technology and either have begun or will begin providing paging service 
as result  metrocall might experience losses in subscribers and recurring revenues and cost increases to stay competitive 
other changes in technology could lower the cost of competing services and products to a level at which metrocall s services and products would become too costly to offer or produce or would require it to reduce its prices 
metrocall cannot assure you that it will be able to develop or introduce new services and products on a timely basis and at competitive prices  if at all  nor can metrocall assure you that its profit margins  inventory costs and cash flows will not be adversely affected by technological developments 
satellite failures metrocall s ability to deliver paging and messaging services could be interrupted if satellite failures occur 
metrocall transmits a majority of its paging and messaging traffic through its global messaging gateway  which is a satellite uplink facility 
any satellite interruption in transmissions might result in loss of subscribers  loss of revenues and increased costs to find alternative ways to respond to the interruptions 
disruptions may also impair its ability to gain more subscribers and increase its revenues 
metrocall also uses land based communications facilities such as microwave stations and landline telephone facilities to connect and control the paging base station transmitters in its networks 
the failure or disruption of transmissions by these satellites and other facilities also could disrupt metrocall s paging and messaging services and impair its results of operations 
subscriber turnover when subscribers cancel or switch their service  the cost to attract new subscribers is higher than the cost to provide services to existing subscribers and  as a result  adversely affects metrocall s results of operations 
subscriber turnover adversely affects metrocall s results of operations because it increases fixed costs 
when subscribers cancel their paging or other messaging services or switch their service to another carrier  metrocall attempts to attract new subscribers to replace the disconnected subscribers 
the sales and marketing costs associated with attracting new subscribers exceed the costs to continue servicing existing subscribers and increase our high fixed costs 
for the twelve months ended december   and  metrocall s subscriber turnover rates were  and  respectively 
regulatory changes and compliance changes in the regulations that govern metrocall s business might make it more difficult or costly to operate its business or comply with its changes 
the fcc and to a lesser extent state regulatory agencies regulate metrocall s paging and messaging operations 
those agencies might take actions  such as changing licensing requirements or the allocation of radio spectrum that would make it more difficult or costly for metrocall to operate its business 
for example  the fcc has adopted rules under which it will issue licenses that would permit companies to offer paging services on a wide area basis through competitive bidding 
metrocall believes these rules may simplify its regulatory compliance burdens  particularly regarding adding or relocating transmitter sites  however  those rules may also increase its costs of obtaining paging licenses in the future 
in addition  metrocall cannot assure you that it will be able to comply with all changes implemented by the agencies regulating its business  such as changes in licensing or build out requirements 
challenges of acquisitions metrocall might not be able identify or finance businesses to acquire 
metrocall may not be able to integrate successfully businesses it acquires or manage its existing business operations as it acquires and integrates other businesses 
metrocall might not be able to execute its growth strategy in the future if it is unable to identify attractive businesses to acquire  to negotiate acceptable terms  to finance potential acquisitions and to integrate acquired businesses 
even if metrocall can pursue an acquisition  it would encounter many obstacles before the acquisition could be successful and increase its revenues or decrease its costs 
the challenges of acquisitions include potential strain on management  unanticipated liabilities or contingencies from the acquired company  reduced earnings due to increased intangible asset amortization  increased interest costs  and costs related to integration  integrating the acquired business s financial  personnel  computer and other systems into its own  and need to manage growth and implement controls and information systems appropriate to a growing company 
if metrocall is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  its business could suffer because of the diversion of management s attention away from existing operations and the increase in costs 
investment in inciscent inciscent is subject to all the risks associated with a start up high technology company 
as a result  metrocall s investment in inciscent is subject to those risks and metrocall cannot assure you that it will benefit financially or strategically from its investment 
inciscent is subject to all the risks associated with a start up high technology company in a market that is likely to have numerous competitors offering wireless application services 
metrocall cannot guarantee that it will realize the financial benefits or strategic objectives it expects from its investment in inciscent 
the success of metrocall s investment in inciscent will depend on inciscent s ability to develop  market and sell its wireless application services 
inciscent s ability to do those things  among others  is subject to the following technology 
the wireless application services that inciscent intends to offer require technology that is still being developed and has not been fully proven 
even if the technology becomes sufficiently developed  inciscent may not have the financial  technical and other resources to obtain and apply the technology it needs for its services 
metrocall cannot guarantee that the technology required for the services of inciscent will be sufficiently developed or will be available to inciscent 
in addition  the development of the technology may lag behind the demands of customers 
metrocall cannot assure you that by the time the technology is sufficiently developed  consumers will still demand the wireless application services that inciscent intends to offer 
market acceptance 
the market for wireless application services is relatively new  and its commercial viability has not been demonstrated 
metrocall cannot assure you that the wireless services offered by inciscent or by inciscent s competitors will find market acceptance 
inciscent s ability to generate recurring revenue will depend on its ability to sign agreements with third parties 
inciscent may not be able to find or attract a sufficient number of customers to generate any revenue for the indefinite future 
competitors 
the market for business to business wired to wireless application services is attracting a number of companies  some of which may have greater resources than inciscent 
as there are more entrants into the market  inciscent may lose existing or potential customers to those entrants or may not be able to offer its services at a competitive price 
anti takeover defenses metrocall has anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of its common stock 
metrocall s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and debt instruments and delaware law could delay  defer or prevent an acquisition or change of control of metrocall or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock 
these provisions include metrocall has a classified board of directors  which means only a portion of its board members terms expire in any given year  thus preventing a third party from replacing the entire board of directors at one time 
metrocall can issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval  which means that the board could issue shares with special voting rights or other provisions that could deter a takeover 
metrocall has a shareholder rights plan  which gives holders of common stock the ability to purchase additional shares of common stock at a bargain price if  among other things  a person acquires of the outstanding common stock 
acquisition of more than of metrocall s voting stock  or replacement of a majority of the board in certain circumstances  could trigger a default under metrocall s credit facility 
also  the same events could require metrocall to repurchase its subordinated notes at of principals plus accrued interest 
section of the delaware law governing corporations will  with some exceptions  prohibit metrocall from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a three year period after that stockholder meets the definition of an interested stockholder 
in addition  each of at t wireless and the three common stock investors has agreed to restrictions on its ability to take actions to influence control of metrocall for a period of time 
the presence of these restrictions and the limitations on the actions of these investors could deter a potential acquisition  given the total amount of issued and outstanding shares of common stock in metrocall that they will own in the aggregate 
dependence on key management personnel if metrocall is unable to retain key management personnel  it might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis and its business operations might be adversely affected 
metrocall s existing operations and continued future developments are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of certain key individuals  including william l 
collins iii  its chief executive officer  steven d 
jacoby  its chief operating officer  and vincent d 
kelly  its chief financial officer 
these individuals have substantial expertise and experience in the paging and messaging industry  know the intricacies of metrocall s business operations and have insights into the future developments and goals of the business 
if metrocall is unable to retain these individuals  it is unlikely metrocall could find individuals to replace them that would have the same degree of expertise  experience  knowledge and insight into the industry and the business operations 
even if metrocall could find replacements  its business would be impaired from the disruption associated with changes in management 
for example  metrocall is largely dependent on these individuals in pursuing its growth and consolidation strategies and in integrating successfully acquired businesses 
as a result  metrocall s business operations could be adversely affected 
metrocall has employment contracts with the named individuals but does not have non competition contracts with or key man life insurance for any of them 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk metrocall is exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
metrocall does not foresee any significant changes in its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in the near future 
at december   total outstanding debt consisted of five issues of fixed rate  senior subordinated notes and the credit facility  which had a variable interest rate fixed rate debt principal effective interest payments balance fair value interest rate maturity due million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually million million semi annually no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
if at maturity metrocall refinanced these notes at interest rates that are percentage point higher than their stated rates  its per annum interest costs would increase by million 
based on the outstanding balances at december  a hypothetical immediate percentage point change in interest rates would change the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations by approximately million 
variable rate debt principal weighted average interest payments balance fair value interest rate maturity due million million quarterly metrocall s credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility and million available for future borrowings 
based on weighted average borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal year  a percentage point change in our weighted average interest rate would have caused interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately million 
repayments under the credit facility may be made at anytime without penalty 
metrocall currently has an interest rate cap agreement in place that caps its interest rates  excluding margin fees  on its floating rate debt at on up to million of outstanding borrowings 
this agreement expires on april
