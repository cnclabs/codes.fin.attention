item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere herein 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview the company is an international distributor of microcomputer products  including personal computers  printers and other peripherals and networking products throughout the united states and latin america 
in fiscal  the company s net sales to customers in the united states represented approximately of total net sales 
net sales for export principally into latin america and in county net sales in brazil  colombia and argentina represented approximately of total net sales for fiscal net sales of microcomputer products generated approximately of total net sales and wireless telephone products represented the remaining for fiscal the company achieved net earnings of million on net sales of million in fiscal although net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  the gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the company incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal this loss resulted primarily from a decision by one of the company s largest vendors to reduce the number of distributors  including sed  thereby diminishing sales and gross profit  and the sharp reductions in sed s miami business  which cut export activity to approximately half of its prior level of sales primarily due to economic instability in the latin american region 
other factors contributing to the fiscal year financial results included a devaluation loss in brazil and excess overhead costs in the us as a result of certain of these trends and events  the loss for fiscal included impairment charges of million for the write down of certain long lived assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has incurred a decline in net sales in the united states since fiscal and has incurred operating losses in either its domestic or certain of its foreign operations at various times during the past three fiscal years 
to address these declines  company management is pursuing a strategic plan to be implemented in fiscal that emphasizes increasing profit margins and reducing administrative and overhead costs 
the goal of the strategic plan is to improve the company s profitability  but there is no assurance that this plan will be successful 
failure to effectively implement the plan could adversely effect the company s profitability and financial condition 
numerous factors and conditions impact the company s ability to adequately effect this strategic plan  including  but not limited to  the following continuation of distribution agreements the company operates under formal but cancellable distribution agreements with certain of its suppliers 
if these agreements were cancelled  the company would be forced to obtain its products through wholesalers 
this would reduce the company s profit margin on the affected products 
availability of certain products from time to time  due to production limitations or heavy demand  the company may only be able to purchase a limited amount of popular products from its suppliers 
product margins the company operates in a very competitive business environment 
accordingly  product margins are continually under pricing pressure 
vendor credit the company significantly relies on its suppliers for trade credit 
changes by the suppliers in their credit terms could force the company to obtain less favorable financing for its purchases 
product obsolescence the company offers a broad line of products that are subject to fast technological obsolescence  which increases the risk of inventory markdown 
through its vendor agreements  the company has certain stock return privileges  which vary from supplier to supplier 
credit decisions and losses the company maintains an experienced customer credit staff and relies on customer payment history and third party data to make customer credit decisions 
nevertheless  the company may experience customer credit losses in excess of its expectations 
the company also maintains credit insurance for customers located in the united states subject to certain terms and conditions 
proportionate control of general and administrative costs the company attempts to control its overhead costs to keep such costs in line with its sales volume 
as sales volumes fluctuate  the company must continually monitor its overhead costs and make adjustments timely and appropriately 
uncertain and possibly volatile economic and political environment in latin america the general economic and political environment in all of the countries in which the company operates in latin america are uncertain and  at times  volatile 
as a result of these conditions  the company could experience unexpected costs from its operations in these countries 
availability of credit facilities the company has operated under a formal credit facility with a bank for many years that is subject to certain collateral limitations and contains certain compliance covenants as more further described in note 
one of the most restrictive covenants requires the company to maintain positive earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization on a quarterly basis 
the company has violated certain of the facility covenants in the past  but has been able to obtain waivers of such violations 
in the event the company borrows or requests to borrow under the credit facility and it fails to maintain covenant compliance  there is no assurance that waivers requested will be granted 
at june  and through september   the company has not borrowed under this credit facility 
cash flows the company s anticipated growth in latin america may require additional capital infusion in the form of equity from the parent company or debt borrowings by the subsidiary 
operating needs and regulatory matters restrict the company s ability to repatriate cash flows to the united states 
for the company s domestic operations  all purchases and sales are denominated in united states dollars 
for the company s operations in brazil  colombia and argentina  in country transactions are conducted in the respective local currencies of these three locations while import purchases are denominated in united states dollars

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of working capital needs  including inventories and trade accounts receivable
