these strategies include utilization of technology  improved merchandising  continual introduction of new items  expanding and enhancing the fresh food program  utilization of a more efficient distribution system  and developing new stores 
information technology 
the core of these operating strategies is the retail information system ris  which is now installed in all us stores 
this proprietary system provides store operators and management at the corporate office and in the field with timely access to item by item sales information captured via a point of sale scanning system at the register 
access to product assortment and historical sales data enhances the ability to improve merchandising decisions and in stock conditions  to identify customer changes in preference  developing trends in the market and items with high or limited sales potential  for the store operator to make better merchandising and ordering decisions  and for each store to better tailor its product mix to align with customer demographics and buying patterns 
merchandising new item introduction 
the continual introduction of new items is an important part of the long term operating strategy 
to meet changing customer needs and build sales  an average of new items were available to eleven stores each week during several significant new item introductions contributed approximately million  or  to the growth in merchandise sales year over year 
partnering with key vendors to develop and introduce proprietary items is an integral part of merchandising strategy  like the introduction of bakery stix by kraft in july 
with approximately  stores located throughout the world  management is seeking opportunities to leverage the number of stores to achieve greater purchasing efficiencies as well as enhance access to products  like the introduction of a proprietary french wine during the holiday season 
fresh foods 
the company continues to refine its fresh food program and believes this category represents a tremendous opportunity  as food to go increases in popularity among all consumer segments 
the company has partnered with third party commissary and bakery experts who own and operate the facilities  which are strategically located in close proximity to one of the combined distribution centers cdcs 
this arrangement has a number of key advantages including allowing new items to be tested easily allowing item selection to be regionalized based on demographics  and providing management the ability to focus more on new product development 
today  proprietary world ovens bakery products and prime deli sandwiches and breakfast items are delivered fresh each day to over  stores 
demand chain management 
the company has been implementing a daily distribution infrastructure to support the fresh food program and other merchandising initiatives and has partnered with third party logistics experts  who own and operate the cdcs that are located throughout the us and canada 
today   stores receive daily delivery of fresh food and other time sensitive and perishable items such as dairy products 
the advantages of cdcs are as follows the accuracy of deliveries is greatly improved  stores have access to a much broader range of products that might otherwise not be available through traditional methods of delivery  delivery times occur during off peak hours  products are fresher  economies of scale provide a better product cost structure  and frequent replenishment minimizes inventory in the stores 
as part of the overall strategy to improve distribution to the stores  the company has worked with other vendors who deliver directly to the store to minimize the frequency of deliveries  improve the accuracy and scheduling of deliveries and increase the number of items delivered through the cdcs 
new store development 
eleven stores are located strategically in urban and suburban markets  which has a number of advantages  including stores being located in high traffic areas  the ability of the company to establish itself as the primary provider of convenience in those areas  and greater efficiencies for both infrastructure utilization and advertising dollars 
during  the company opened new stores in the us and canada and plans to open new stores each year for the foreseeable future 
these new stores are generally located in existing markets  which increases utilization of both the cdc and fresh food programs as well as providing a stronger market presence 
e commerce 
in january  the company announced plans to install self service financial services kiosks in stores located in the dallas fort worth area during the touch screen kiosks will immediately provide customers with the ability to cash checks  purchase money orders  perform traditional atm transactions  and execute wire transfers 
in the future  a wide range of services will be introduced  including event ticketing and e commerce applications such as on line shopping for books  music and videos 
the company has a unique opportunity to serve as a point of access for both the ordering and delivery of a wide variety of e commerce products and services 
the company s e commerce strategy is to leverage the kiosks and the eleven web site  providing customers a point of contact to the internet  with the nationwide network of stores and daily distribution infrastructure to provide an element of convenience to on line shopping 
the daily distribution capabilities provided by the combined distribution centers will enable customers to pick up items ordered on line at their convenience hours a day  days a year

cigarettes based on the company s purchases currently contribute nearly of the company s total merchandise sales and more than of merchandise gross profit 
with the recent and pending legal settlements between cigarette manufacturers and several state governments  as well as potential additional taxes and litigation threatened by the federal government  the company anticipates that the cost of cigarettes could continue to rise 
additionally  there are numerous examples of pending state and federal legislation aimed at reducing minors consumption of tobacco products  which include significant increases in cigarette taxes 
although the company expects merchandise margin percent to be negatively impacted by these price increases  it is impossible to predict the impact potential cost increases could have on the company s gross profit dollars  due to uncertainties regarding competitors reactions and consumers buying habits

approximately of such royalties were from area license agreements with seven eleven japan co  ltd 
sej 
sej royalty income will not fluctuate with exchange rate movements since the company has effectively hedged this exposure by using the royalty income to make principal and interest payments on its yen denominated loans see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to fluctuating exchange rates on the non sej portion of its royalties earned in foreign currency  but based on current estimates  future risk is not material 
the company has several wholly or partially owned foreign subsidiaries and is susceptible to exchange rate risk on earnings from these subsidiaries 
based on current estimates  the company does not consider future foreign exchange risk associated with these subsidiaries to be material 
equity price risk management 
the company has equity securities of other companies  which are classified as available for sale and are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized as other comprehensive earnings  net of tax  as a separate component of shareholders equity

other issues environmental in december  the company closed its chemical manufacturing facility in new jersey 
the company is required to conduct environmental remediation at the facility  including groundwater monitoring and treatment for a projected year period  which commenced in the company has recorded undiscounted liabilities representing its best estimates of the clean up costs of million at december  in  the company and the former owner of the facility entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which the former owner agreed to pay a substantial portion of the clean up costs 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the financial resources of the former owner  the company has a receivable of million recorded at december  additionally  the company accrues for the anticipated future costs and the related probable state reimbursement amounts for remediation activities at its existing and previously operated gasoline sites where releases of regulated substances have been detected 
at december  the company s estimated undiscounted liability for these sites was million 
this estimate is based on the company s prior experience with gasoline sites and its consideration of such factors as the age of the tanks  location of tank sites and experience with contractors who perform environmental assessment and remediation work 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the future remediation costs for detected releases at these sites as of december  will be incurred within the next four to five years 
under state reimbursement programs  the company is eligible to receive reimbursement for a portion of future remediation costs  as well as a portion of remediation costs previously paid 
accordingly  at december   the company has recorded a net receivable of million for the estimated probable state reimbursements  which includes an increase of approximately million resulting from recent legislative changes in california which have expanded and extended that state s program 
in assessing the probability of state reimbursements  the company takes into consideration each state s fund balance  revenue sources  existing claim backlog  status of clean up activity and claim ranking systems 
as a result of these assessments  the recorded receivable amount is net of an allowance of million 
while there is no assurance of the timing of the receipt of state reimbursement funds  based on its experience  the company expects to receive the majority of state reimbursement funds  except from california  within one to three years after payment of eligible remediation expenses 
this time period assumes that the state administrative procedures for processing such reimbursements have been fully developed 
because of recent legislative changes in california  the company now estimates it will receive reimbursement of most of its identified remediation expenses in california  although it may take one to ten years to receive these reimbursement funds 
as a result of the timing in receiving reimbursement funds from the various states  the company has present valued the portion of the total recorded receivable amount that relates to remedial activities that have already been completed at a discount rate of approximately 
thus  the recorded receivable amount is also net of an aggregate discount of million 
the estimated future assessment and remediation expenditures and related state reimbursement amounts could change within the near future as governmental requirements and state reimbursement programs continue to be implemented or revised

one of these current franchisees has dismissed his appeal 
the settlement agreement will not become effective until the appeals are resolved 
however  the settlement agreement provides that while the appeals are pending the company will pay certain maintenance and supply expenses relating to the cash registers and retail information system equipment of current franchisees that are members of the settlement class 
if the settlement is overturned on appeal  the company has the right to require franchisees to repay the amounts that the company paid for these expenses while the appeals were pending 
the company s payment of these expenses had no material impact on earnings for or and should have no material impact on future earnings 
the company s accruals are sufficient to cover the total settlement costs  including the payment due to former franchisees when the settlement becomes effective 
impact of year issues over the last several years  the company has prepared for the possible disruptions that might have resulted from the date change to the year no significant year problems were experienced and at this point the company believes no material exposure to year issues exist
