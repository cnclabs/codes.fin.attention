item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute products used worldwide in biomedical research that are instrumental in the development of new drug therapies and medical diagnostic methods 
our products enable scientists and biomedical researchers to better understand biochemistry  immunology and cell biology of the human body  as well as disease processes 
through acquisitions and internal growth  we believe we have grown to include a unique combination of technological  production  and research and development skills resulting in a full spectrum of products and services for the worldwide pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
biosource was originally incorporated as a california corporation in october  and was reincorporated as a delaware corporation in may in connection with the acquisition of tago immunologicals  inc  a manufacturer of immunological reagents derived from antibodies produced in goats and other animals 
in november  we acquired keystone laboratories  inc  a manufacturer of oligonucleotides 
in june  we acquired assets and assumed selected liabilities of medgenix diagnostics  sa located in fleurus  belgium 
the medgenix assets consisted of diagnostic and research assay kits  and included manufacturing and distribution facilities  research and development laboratories  customer accounts and an existing employee base 
in december  biosource acquired quality controlled biochemicals  inc  a manufacturer of peptides and antibodies 
in december  we also acquired substantially all the assets and selected liabilities of biofluids  inc  a manufacturer of serum  buffers and media 
in  we incurred a net loss of  the loss was primarily the result of charges of approximately  related to the establishment of valuation reserves for our antibody inventories  and the reduction of our inventory value for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  or elisa  test kits and products manufactured in europe and  related to purchased in process technology in connection with our acquisition of qcb in december as a result of the net loss  we had net operating losses that benefited our income tax provision in all of our net operating losses have been recognized as of december  we currently manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after receipt of orders and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  we have not developed a significant backlog of products and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog of products in the future 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
 of the increase is attributable to the revenues generated from the qcb and biofluids acquisitions in december the remaining increase is related to the increase in the volume of sales of assay kits and oligonucleotides 
foreign sales represented of total sales in and of total sales in net sales in the united states were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
 of the increase is attributable to the revenues generated from the qcb and biofluids acquisitions in december the additional increase was generated primarily from the increase in the sales of assay kits and oligonucleotides 
net sales to japan were  in  an increase of  or  over the prior year 
european sales were  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of assay kits 
gross profit 
gross profit in was  or of net sales  compared to  or of sales for the increased gross margin is primarily the result of a charge of approximately  related to the establishment in of valuation reserves for antibody inventories and the reduction of inventory value for elisa test kits and products manufactured in europe 
research and development 
research and development expense in was  and in was  increased costs in domestic expenditures of approximately  were due to the additional expenditures of our qcb subsidiary acquired in december these costs were offset by a reduction of  in our european expenses related to staff and other cost reductions in europe 
purchased in process technology 
the purchased in process technology charge in of  relates to the portion of the qcb purchase price that was allocated to products in development which had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and did not have alternative future uses 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  purchased in process technology is required to be expensed 
you should read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this item 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense was  in compared to  in the increased sales and marketing expense of  or  is primarily due to additional costs associated with sales and marketing activities of our qcb subsidiary and biofluids division acquired in december as well as overall increased advertising and other marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were  in and  in general and administrative expenses decreased as a result of a settlement of a legal claim by the former landlord of our belgium facility and costs associated with the transition and relocation of our belgium subsidiary  offset by an increase of additional costs related to the acquisitions of qcb and biofluids in december amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangible assets was  in and  in the increase was due to the full year amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of qcb and biofluids in december interest income and expense 
interest expense of  in and  in was related to the interest expense on the note used to finance the acquisition of qcb and biofluids in december interest income of  in and  in was derived from interest income on invested cash 
income tax expense benefit 
the income tax expense in was  while the income tax benefit in was  the effective income tax rate of for reflects the benefit of the utilization of all prior net operating losses in our belgium and other european subsidiaries 
the effective rate of for reflects non deductible foreign losses of approximately year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales were  in  an increase of  or over net sales in the united states were  in  an increase of  or  over the increase in sales was driven by increases in sales of assays and oligonucleotides 
net sales to european customers were  in  a decrease of  or  over the decline in sales was driven primarily by reduced sales of radioimmuno assay kits 
these kits were facing strong competition from non radioactive assays and as a result we were realizing a decline in revenue and market share 
net sales in japan were  in  an increase of  or  over the prior year 
the increase in sales was driven primarily by increases in sales of our elisa kits to both new and existing japanese customers 
however  japanese sales in the december quarter were affected by the adverse economic climate in asia 
a large portion of our sales are derived from foreign sales  representing of our net sales in and of our net sales in although the percentage of domestic sales to total net sales has remained relatively constant  domestic sales volume has increased by in and in as compared to the prior year 
gross profit 
gross profit was  or  in and  or  in the decline in gross profit of  or  in as compared to was primarily the result of charges of approximately  related to the establishment of a valuation reserve for our antibody inventory and the reduction of inventory value for elisa test kits and products manufactured in europe 
our strategy is to maintain a broad base of products available for sale to our customers 
with regard to the antibody product inventory  we offer over  antibodies for sale and find it to be more cost efficient to produce large quantities of the antibody product during each production run 
however  this inventory turns slowly 
attempts have been made to reduce the quantity of antibody inventory maintained in stock in order to increase the inventory turnover 
however  this approach did not allow us to maintain proper strategic levels of inventory necessary to service our customer needs 
as a result  in order to properly account for excess or slow moving inventory resulting from large production runs  the appropriate financial management policy with regard to the antibody inventory was determined to be one of expensing the cost of production as incurred as a component of cost of sales 
also contributing to the reduced gross profit is an increased percentage of sales of lower profit oligonucleotides as compared to the prior year and costs relating to the sale of custom antibodies  custom peptides  sera  buffers and media resulting from our acquisitions of qcb and biofluids in december research and development 
research and development expense was  in and  in the increased research and development expense of  in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  expenditures related to the development of new product lines and additions to current product lines  a reduction in grant funds received in the current fiscal year and research and development expenditures related to qcb for the month of december purchased in process technology 
purchased in process technology was  in as compared to zero in the purchased in process technology charge in relates to the portion of the qcb purchase price that was allocated to products in development which had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and did not have alternative future uses 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  purchased in process technology is required to be expensed 
you should read note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this item 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were  in and  in the increased sales and marketing expense of  or  in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  costs related to the repatriation of a united states employee that had been assigned to an overseas position and increased advertising and other marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were  in and  in the increased general and administrative expense of  or  in as compared to is primarily due to increased staffing costs  the settlement of a claim by our former landlord of our belgian facility  costs associated with the closure of overseas offices  costs related to the repatriation of a united states employee that had been assigned to an overseas position and costs related to operating qcb and biofluids for the period from the acquisition dates to december  the increased general and administrative expense of  or  in as compared to is primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisition of biosource europe 
additionally  costs increased in the united states predominantly due to increased staffing costs required to support biosource s domestic growth 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was  in and  in the increase of  was due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of qcb and biofluids in december interest income and expense 
interest expense of  in was related to the interest expense on the note used to finance the acquisition of qcb and biofluids 
interest expense of  in was related to interest expense on the notes used to finance the purchase of our current facilities in camarillo  california 
interest income of  in and  in was derived from interest income on invested cash 
income tax expense benefit 
our income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  our income tax expense for the year ended december  was  the income tax benefit recorded in is primarily due to the inventory valuation reserves and purchased in process technology charges recorded in quarterly results the following table sets forth various unaudited statement of income data for the last eight quarters  has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information and  in management s opinion  includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information for each of the quarters below

working capital  which is the excess of current assets over current liabilities  at december   was  as compared to  at december  representing an increase of  or 
biosource s policy is to maintain liquidity in its investments to provide working capital and have the ability to react to future potential long term investment opportunities in complementary businesses  products and technologies 
capital expenditures of  for the year ended december   were primarily for the purchases of laboratory  manufacturing and computer equipment 
the funding for these expenditures was obtained from our working capital 
in april  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock at market price 
in december  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  additional shares of our outstanding common stock at market price and in august we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional  shares of our outstanding common stock at market price 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended december   or for the period from january   through march  as of december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for  an average price of per share  since the inception of the repurchase program in april in december  we executed a loan agreement with union bank of california  na and borrowed  which was used to finance the acquisitions of the stock of qcb and all of the assets and selected liabilities of biofluids 
as of december   the balance was  on february   we repaid  of our borrowings under the loan agreement with the proceeds of our series b preferred stock and warrants financing 
on march   we amended this loan agreement to convert our balance of  to a line of credit and on march   we repaid  of the line of credit 
our line of credit provides for borrowings of up to  and expires on february  interest on the line of credit is payable monthly at libor plus 
covenants in the loan agreement require us to maintain a minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net assets  achieve minimum net profit levels  and comply with specified ratios of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to debt service costs 
we are also required to comply with various non financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with regard to these covenants 
qcb had six loans outstanding aggregating  with metrowest bank which we assumed upon completion of the acquisition of qcb in december these loans were refinanced with union bank of california  n 
a in january as of january   we had completely repaid each of these loans with the proceeds received from the sale of warrants 
on february   we issued  shares of our series b preferred stock with an initial aggregate liquidation value of  the series b preferred stock is initially convertible into  shares of our common stock at an effective price of per share of common stock 
the series b preferred stock will be entitled to receive in kind dividends at a rate of of the original issue price 
unless all dividends on the outstanding shares of series b preferred stock have been paid  no dividends or other distributions shall be paid to common stockholders 
the series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference to the common stock 
this preferred stock also is automatically convertible upon any of the following events a public offering of common stock of not less than per share  which results in proceeds to us of at least  before commissions or discounts  the date we specify to the holders  if the last reported sale price of our stock is above per share for consecutive trading days on the nasdaq national market  or the holders of greater than of the shares of the series b inform us in writing of their desire to convert the shares 
holders of series b preferred stock have the right to require us to redeem the series b preferred stock at the original liquidation value plus accrued dividends after february   or as early as february   if various stock price thresholds are not met 
in connection with the issuance of series b preferred stock  the holders received detachable stock purchase warrants 
the warrants are exercisable for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we allocated the net proceeds of  based on the relative fair value of the warrants and the series b preferred stock 
the book value of the series b preferred stock of  will accrete to its liquidation value immediately by  related to the beneficial conversion feature  then through february or earlier upon accelerated conversion  under the interest method 
this accretion will not have an effect on net income  but will reduce the income available to common stockholders used to calculate basic earnings per share 
on march   we entered into a lease for a new facility in camarillo  california 
the lease will commence on may   and expires on june   with the option to continue the lease for two additional five year terms 
annual lease payments in the initial five year period ended december   range from  at inception to  at termination 
we currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from an offering of our common stock to acquire complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  for research and development  working capital  and other general corporate purposes 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies and expect that we may likely undertake one or more such acquisitions during we believe that the net proceeds from the offering  together with our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
year the following statements constitute a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
prior to the end of  we completed our systems assessment and installed a new version of our business system software that is purported to be year compliant by the software vendor 
we have implemented the software as well as some other less significant software  and fully tested the software to ensure year compliance 
software for one piece of laboratory equipment was determined to require an upgrade in order to be year compliant which was subsequently implemented 
to date  we have not experienced any material failures of any of our systems related to the failure of year compliance 
in addition  to date  we have not been made aware of any year compliance failures involving our customers and suppliers 
to date  we have spent an immaterial amount on the compliance program  and we do not expect to incur any material additional amounts 
the costs discussed above do not include our internal costs  principally the payroll costs for those persons working on the project  which costs we do not track 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
addresses the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
we are evaluating the statement s provisions to determine the effect on our financial statements 
in addition  the impact of sfas no 
will depend on the terms of future transactions 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report before purchasing shares of our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following events or outcomes actually occur  our business  operating results and financial condition would likely suffer 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to purchase our common stock 
risks related to our business failure to manage our growth and expansion could impair our business 
we historically have sought  and will continue to seek  to increase our sales and profitability primarily through the acquisition or internal development of new product lines  additional customers and new businesses 
our historical revenue growth is primarily attributable to our acquisitions and new product development and  to a lesser extent  to increased revenues from our existing products 
we expect that future acquisitions  if successfully consummated  will create increased working capital requirements  which will likely precede by several months any material contribution of an acquisition to our net income 
our ability to achieve our expansion objectives and to manage our growth effectively and profitably depends upon a variety of factors  including 
our ability to internally develop new products  
our ability to make profitable acquisitions  
integration of new facilities into existing operations  
hiring  training and retention of qualified personnel  
establishment of new relationships or expansion of existing relationships with customers and suppliers  and 
availability of capital 
in addition  the implementation of our growth strategy will place significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increased demands on our financial systems and controls 
our ability to manage our growth successfully will require us to continue to improve and expand these resources  systems and controls 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our operating results could be adversely affected 
moreover  there can be no assurance that our historic rate of growth will continue  that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 
we cannot guarantee that our future acquisitions will be successful 
we compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies which have significantly greater financial and management resources than us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or investment opportunities will be identified  that any of these transactions can be consummated  or that  if acquired  these new businesses can be integrated successfully and profitably into our operations 
these acquisitions and investments may also require a significant allocation of resources  which will reduce our ability to focus on the other portions of our business  including many of the factors listed in the prior risk factor 
reduction or delays in research and development budgets and in government funding may negatively impact our sales 
our customers include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions and government and private laboratories 
fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
research and development budgets fluctuate due to numerous factors that are outside our control and are difficult to predict  including changes in available resources  spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies 
our business could be seriously damaged by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions or government and private laboratories 
a significant portion of our sales has been to researchers  universities  government laboratories and private foundations whose funding is dependent upon grants from government agencies such as the us national institutes of health and similar domestic and international agencies 
although the level of research funding has increased during the past several years  we cannot assure you that this trend will continue 
government funding of research and development is subject to the political process  which is inherently fluid and unpredictable 
our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government budget proposals 
also  government proposals to reduce or eliminate budgetary deficits have sometimes included reduced allocations to the nih and other government agencies that fund research and development activities 
a reduction in government funding for the nih or other government research agencies could seriously damage our business 
many of our customers receive funds from approved grants at particular times of the year  as determined by the federal government 
grants have  in the past  been frozen for extended periods or have otherwise become unavailable to various institutions without advance notice 
the timing of the receipt of grant funds affects the timing of purchase decisions by our customers and  as a result  can cause fluctuations in our sales and operating results 
we rely on raw materials for our manufacturing  which we may not always be able to obtain on favorable terms 
our manufacturing process relies on the continued availability of high quality raw materials 
it is possible that a change in vendors  or in the quality of the raw materials supplied to us  could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing process and  ultimately  on the sale of our finished products 
we have from time to time experienced a disruption in the quality or availability of key raw materials  which has created minor delays in our ability to fill orders for specific test kits 
this could occur again in the future  resulting in significant delays  and could have a detrimental impact on the sale of our products and our results of operations 
our ability to raise the capital necessary to expand our business is uncertain 
in the future  in order to expand our business through internal development or acquisitions  we may need to raise substantial additional funds through equity or debt financings  research and development financings or collaborative relationships 
however  this additional funding may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on economically reasonable terms 
in addition  any additional funding may result in significant dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or obtain funds through collaborative partners that may require us to release material rights to our products 
our research and development efforts for new products may be unsuccessful 
we incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products and technologies 
there can be no assurance that any of these products or technologies will be successfully developed or that if developed  will be commercially successful 
in the event that we are unable to develop commercialized products from our research and development efforts or we are unable or unwilling to allocate amounts beyond our currently anticipated research and development investment  we could lose our entire investment in these new products and technologies 
failure to license new technologies could impair our new product development 
our business model of providing products to researchers working on a variety of genetic projects requires us to develop a wide spectrum of products 
to generate broad product lines it is advantageous to sometimes license technologies from others rather than depending exclusively on our own employees 
as a result  we believe our ability to license new technologies from third parties is and will continue to be important to our ability to offer new products 
in addition  from time to time we are notified or become aware of patents held by third parties that are related to technologies we are selling or may sell in the future 
after a review of these patents  we may decide to obtain a license for these technologies from these third parties 
we are currently in the process of negotiating several of these licenses and expect that we will also negotiate these types of licenses in the future 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to negotiate these licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to gain access to technologies needed for new products and services also depends in part on our ability to convince licensors that we can successfully commercialize their inventions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to identify new technologies developed by others 
even if we are able to identify new technologies of interest  we may not be able to negotiate a license on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to introduce new products  or our new products are not accepted by potential customers  we may lose market share 
rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions are typical for our market 
our future success will depend in part on continuous  timely development and introduction of new products that address evolving market requirements 
we believe successful new product introductions provide a significant competitive advantage because customers make an investment of time in selecting and learning to use a new product  and then are reluctant to switch 
to the extent we fail to introduce new and innovative products  we may lose market share to our competitors  which will be difficult or impossible to regain 
an inability  for technological or other reasons  to successfully develop and introduce new products could reduce our growth rate or damage our business 
in the past we have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  delays in the development and introduction of products 
we cannot assure you that we will keep pace with the rapid rate of change in life sciences research  or that our new products will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance 
some of the factors affecting market acceptance of new products include 
availability  quality and price relative to competitive products  
the timing of introduction of the product relative to competitive products  
scientists opinion of the product s usefulness  
citation of the product in published research  and 
general trends in life sciences research 
the expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
failure to attract and retain qualified scientific or production personnel or loss of key management or key personnel could hurt our business 
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform research and development work and product manufacturing is critical to our success 
because the industry in which we compete is very competitive  we face significant challenges attracting and retaining this qualified personnel base 
although we believe we have been and will be able to attract and retain these personnel  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully attract qualified personnel 
in addition  our anticipated growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise  such as clinical testing  government approvals  production and marketing  will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 
the failure to attract and retain these personnel or  alternatively  to develop this expertise internally would adversely affect our business 
our success also will continue to depend to a significant extent on the members of our management team and  in particular  on our chief executive officer and president  james h 
chamberlain 
except for an employment agreement with mr 
chamberlain  which has a term expiring on december   and an employment agreement with jordan fishman  phd  our vice president  cellular biology  which has a term expiring on november   we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or key employees or maintain any key man insurance policies regarding any of these individuals 
we may not be able to retain the services of our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified members to management in the future 
the loss of services of mr 
chamberlain  dr 
fishman or of any of our other key management or employees  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
many of our customers are obtaining our products through new distribution channels and methods that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
many of our customers have developed purchasing initiatives to reduce the number of vendors they purchase from in order to lower their supply costs 
these activities force us to supply the large distributors with our products at a discount to reach those customers 
for similar reasons  many larger customers  including the federal government  have special pricing arrangements  including blanket purchase agreements 
these agreements may limit our pricing flexibility with respect to our products  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  although we accept and process some orders through our internet website  we also implement sales through third party internet vendors 
internet sales through third parties will negatively impact our gross margins because we pay commission on these internet sales 
we rely on international sales  which are subject to additional risks 
international sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in international sales can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  
longer payment cycles  
adverse economic or political changes  
potential trade restrictions  exchange controls and import and export licensing requirements  
problems in collecting accounts receivable  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
we intend to continue to generate revenues from sales outside the united states in the future 
future distribution of our products outside the united states also may be subject to greater governmental regulation 
these regulations  which include requirements for approvals or clearance to market  additional time required for regulatory review and sanctions imposed for violations  as well as the other risks indicated in the bullets listed above  vary by country 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the countries in which we currently sell our products or in countries where we may sell our products in the future 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we also depend on third party distributors for a material portion of our international sales 
if we lose or suffer any significant reduction in sales to any material distributor  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  approximately of our sales are made in foreign currencies  primarily belgian francs  british pounds  and german marks 
although a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently  or is anticipated in the future to be  denominated in euros as a result of the european monetary union  we are not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the past  gains and losses on the conversion of our accounts receivable arising from international operations have contributed to negative fluctuations in our results of operations 
in general  increases in the exchange rate of the united states dollar to foreign currencies cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in those countries  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in some cases 
we historically have not  and currently are not  using hedging transactions or other means to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which many of our sales are made 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that are important to our business 
we regard our trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property as a component of our success 
we rely on trademark law and trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers  partners and others to protect our intellectual property 
effective trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  our third party confidentiality agreements can be breached and  if they are  there may not be an adequate remedy available to us 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive position 
intellectual property or other litigation could harm our business 
litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry 
we are aware that patents have been applied for  and in some cases issued to others  claiming technologies that are closely related to ours 
as a result  and in part due to the ambiguities and evolving nature of intellectual property law  we periodically receive notices of potential infringement of patents held by others 
although to date we have successfully resolved these types of claims  we may not be able to do so in the future 
in the event of an intellectual property dispute  we may be forced to litigate 
this litigation could involve proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office or the international trade commission  as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties 
intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive  and these expenses  as well as the consequences should we not prevail  could seriously harm our business 
if a third party claimed an intellectual property right to technology we use  we might need to discontinue an important product or product line  alter our products and processes  pay license fees or cease our affected business activities 
although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition to intellectual property litigation  other substantial  complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management 
for example  lawsuits by employees  stockholders  collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business 
disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in our industry  and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court 
accidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect our business 
portions of our operations require the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials 
although we believe our safety procedures comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state  local and foreign regulations  the risk of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for any damages that result  which could seriously damage our business and results of operations 
our sales are subject to seasonality  which means that we have less revenue in some months 
we experience a slowing of sales in europe during the summer months and worldwide during the christmas holidays 
generally  our fourth quarter revenues are significantly lower than our revenues in each of the first three quarters of the year 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts  which could result in reductions in the market price of our common stock 
potential product liability claims could affect our earnings and financial condition 
we face a potential risk of liability claims based on our products and services  and we have faced such claims in the past 
we carry product liability insurance coverage which is limited in scope and amount but which we believe to be adequate 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to maintain this insurance at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms 
we also cannot assure you that this insurance will be adequate to protect us against a product liability claim  should one arise 
the labor laws applicable to our employees in europe may restrict the flexibility of our management 
as of february   of our employees worked for our biosource europe subsidiary  which is located in nivelles  belgium 
as a result of belgian labor laws  we are required to make specified severance payments in the event we reduce the number of our employees working at this facility 
accordingly  our management may be limited by the application of the belgian labor laws in the determination of staffing levels  and may have less flexibility in making such determinations than our competitors whose employees are not subject to similar labor laws 
risks associated with our industry the biomedical research products industry is very competitive  and we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in this industry in the future 
we are engaged in a segment of the biomedical research products industry that is highly competitive 
many of our competitors  both in the united states and elsewhere  are major pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies  and many of them have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs  and facilities than we do 
any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may also be more successful than us in producing and marketing their products 
we expect this competition to continue and intensify in the future 
our industry has also seen substantial consolidation in recent years  which has led to the creation of competitors with greater financial and intellectual property resources than us 
in addition  we believe that the success that others have had in our industry will attract new competitors 
some of our current and future competitors also may cooperate to better compete against us 
we may not be able to compete effectively against these current or future competitors 
increased competition could result in price reductions for our products  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  we may lose existing customers or have greater difficulty obtaining new customers 
in recent years  the united states pharmaceutical industry has undergone substantial consolidation 
as part of many business combinations  companies frequently reduce the number of suppliers used and we may not be selected as a supplier after any business combination 
further  mergers or corporate consolidations in the pharmaceutical industry could cause us to lose existing customers and potential future customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently subject to government regulation 
our business is currently subject to regulation  supervision and licensing by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
also  from time to time we must expend resources to comply with newly adopted regulations  as well as changes in existing regulations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to disciplinary actions or administrative enforcement actions 
these actions could result in penalties  including fines 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  and there has been substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including 
variations in our quarterly operating results  
the gain or loss of significant contracts  
changes in management  
announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  
legislative or regulatory changes  
general trends in the industry  
recommendations by securities industry analysts  
biological or medical discoveries  
developments concerning intellectual property  including patents and litigation matters  
public concern as to the safety of new technologies  
developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers  and 
general economic conditions  both in the united states and abroad 
as a result of these factors  and potentially others  the sales price of our common stock has ranged from to per share from january  through march  and from to per share from january  through march  for additional information regarding the price range of our common stock  see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock  as well as the stock of many biotechnology companies 
often  price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company 
if we were subject to this type of litigation in the future  we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under applicable law could impair the ability of a third party to take over our company 
we are subject to various legal and contractual provisions that may impede a change in our control  including the following 
our adoption of a stockholders rights plan  which could result in the significant dilution of the proportionate ownership of any person that engages in an unsolicited attempt to take over our company  and 
the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to our common stock 
these provisions  as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under the delaware general corporations law  may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our company  even if the acquisition attempt was at a premium over the market value of our common stock at that time 
our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our capital stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs 
after the completion of our offering  for which we filed a registration statement on march   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders will continue to beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  based upon the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of march  in addition  these same persons also hold options to acquire additional shares of our common stock  which may increase their percentage ownership of the common stock further in the future 
accordingly  these stockholders 
will be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors  
will significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including change of control transactions  and 
will continue to have significant influence over our affairs 
this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us 
this in turn could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
it could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to you 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on this investment likely depends on your selling our stock at a profit

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including belgian francs  british pounds and german marks  and are therefore subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate movements between the dates that foreign currency transactions are initiated and the dates that they are converted 
we are also subject to exchange rate exposures arising from the translation and consolidation of the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries 
although a significant portion of the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business is currently  or is anticipated in the future to be  denominated in euros as a result of the european monetary union  we are not certain about the effect of the euro on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that actions taken to manage our exchange rate exposures will continue to be successful or that future changes in currency exchange rates will not have a material impact on our future cash collections and operating results 
we do not currently hedge either our translation risk or our economic risk associated with the exchange of foreign currencies into us dollars 
our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to outstanding commercial debt 
due to the recent paydown of our commercial debt  we anticipate no material market risk exposure for changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we have not included quantitative tabular disclosures
