as is generally the case in the recreational vehicle industry  various factors can influence sales 
these factors include demographics  increases in interest rates  competition  restrictions on the availability of financing for the purchase of recreational vehicles as well as significant increases in the cost of gasoline 
the company s business is also seasonal in that normally the majority of sales occur in the second and third quarter 
prior to  the company operated two manufacturing divisions  lancaster  california and elkhart  indiana 
during  the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan of restructuring whereby the company implemented a plan to cease production operations at its elkhart  indiana manufacturing plant and potentially sell all or part of the real estate the facility occupied 
this decision was based upon the company s evaluation of costs and the product quality of the recreational vehicles being produced in elkhart 
concurrent with this decision  the company completed an expansion of its lancaster facility to accommodate the expected rise in production 
throughout the company retained its wholesale motorhome sales  warranty and service operations at the indiana production facility 
in december  the company sold the indiana facility 
two key transactions adversely impacted the company s results of operations during in addition to the aforementioned restructuring charge for the production closure of the elkhart facility  the company reached a settlement of an existing class action lawsuit against the company 
pursuant to the settlement  the company was required to pay  plus issue coupons to all members of the class for a discount of on future repairs or  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle 
the company reported the impact from these transactions as charges in the accompanying statement of operations aggregating  for the restructuring and  for the lawsuit settlement during during  the company s restructuring effort was completed and  of the restructuring charge was reversed 
in the fourth quarter of  of the legal settlement was reversed as a result of less than expected coupon redemptions

the number of units shipped in increased to in from  in  an increase of 
the average net selling price increased approximately during the period 
the increase in average per unit selling price results from a increase in diesel model sales over the prior year and continued increases in double slide unit sales 
the increases in these higher priced models were complimented by the strong demand for rexhall s lower priced vision and american clipper models  whose sales increased by over sales 
the increase in diesel sales came mainly because the company lagged behind in gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for  an increase of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the gross profit margin remained steady as the company was able to hold most material costs stable and pass on the few increases that were necessary 
while there was no material change in production labor cost  the introduction of the millennium edition motorhome in late resulted in a temporary increase in direct labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for overall  sg a expense remained relatively unchanged from the prior year 
within this cost category several areas of cost increased in conjunction with sales but were offset by other reductions in cost 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from in to in results from the increased sales level while maintaining the level of administrative spending 
at december   the company s most significant obligations under the masterjohn legal settlement had been completed

gross profit for the year ended december  increased to million from million for  an increase of million or 
the gross margin for was as compared to for the increase in gross profit is due to increased operating efficiencies and improved quality at the california plant primarily serving our major market in the western united states and higher margins associated with the increased sales of units equipped with higher priced options

during  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring of the company s operations 
the restructuring plan provided for changes in operational and production strategies 
in implementing these plans  the company decided to cease manufacturing operations at its elkhart  indiana plant 
the closure of this facility was done in conjunction with the recently completed expansion of its lancaster  california facility to accommodate the anticipated increased production 
the company believes that the national market can be adequately served from the california facility and hat any slight increase in freight charges will be more than offset by the reduced manufacturing costs 
as a result of this strategic change  the company wrote down or wrote off entirely certain of its property and equipment and inventories located at the elkhart facility aggregating  in addition  the company recorded additional charges for severance costs and other expected costs associated with the facility closure aggregating  the total charge of  was recorded as a restructuring charge in the accompanying statement of operations 
during  the company reached a tentative settlement of its class action lawsuit 
under the settlement agreement  the company agreed to pay  in cash  and issue one coupon per vehicle owned by the members of the class for  towards the purchase of a new rexhall vehicle or towards service  parts and labor 
coupons would be redeemable at the company s service center and at designated dealerships which are suitably dispersed around the country

forward looking statements our statements of our intentions or expectations are forward looking statements based on assumptions and on facts known to us today 
those assumptions will become less valid over time  but we do not intend to update this report 
rexhall s business is seasonal  and we are approaching the period when sales have usually declined 
low interest rates  low unemployment  and ready availability of motor fuel have in the past been associated with favorable recreational vehicle sales as has occured in and however  the recent interest rate and gas price increases  coupled with recent reports of decreased consumer confidence may reduce future sales levels 
the seriousness of a potential decline cannot be predicted 
many of rexhall s competitors are substantially larger  and many of its suppliers and dealer s also have greater economic power so that the volume and prices of both supplies and sales may be adversely affected 
management intends to remain aware of these factors and react to them  but cannot predict their timing or significance 
liquidity and capital resources the company has relied primarily on internally generated funds  trade credit and debt to finance its operations and expansions 
as of december   the company had working capital of  compared to  at december  the  increase in working capital was generated by operating income and the sale of the indiana production facility 
significant working capital increases are reflected in a  increase in inventories   in accounts receivable   increase in cash and a  decrease in various accrual  partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable 
the company continued to maintain a higher than usual level of chassis inventory during this time of strong demand for motorhomes 
management believes this is a good investment of resources as long as the carrying costs are within the company s capital means and profit margins 
as of december  the company has a  line of credit with bank of america which can be used for working capital purposes 
under this line of credit   has been set aside as an irrevocable standby letter of credit for the company to meet the requirements for self insurance established by the department of industrial relations which regulates workmen s compensation insurance in california 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit contains various covenants 
the company was in compliance with such covenants as of december  the company has a line of credit with a chassis vendor  ford motor credit company fmcc  with a  limit 
borrowings under the line bear interest at an annual rate of prime plus at december  
all borrowings are secured by the company s assets 
the outstanding balances included in accounts payable at december  and were  and  respectively 
this  over advance at december  is the result of increased chassis inventory level and is currently being negotiated with fmcc 
the company is confident that this temporary over advance will be approved or the line expanded 
the company has adequate resources to pay down this amount to the borrowing limit if approval is not obtained 
capital expenditures during were  management anticipates an increased level of capital expenditures in the company anticipates that it will be able to satisfy its ongoing cash requirements through  including payments related to the legal settlement and expansion plans at the california facility  primarily with cash flows from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by borrowings under its revolving credit agreement
