item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see cautionary statements 
acquisition of cardinal holding corp 
on july   we acquired cardinal holding corp 
through its merger with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as if we were acquired by cardinal in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting required that we carry forward cardinal s net assets at their historical book value and reflect our net assets at their estimated fair value at the date of the merger 
accordingly  all historical financial information presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for periods prior to july  reflect cardinal s results on a stand alone basis 
cardinal s historical operating results were substantially different than ours for the same periods and reflected substantial non cash and extraordinary charges associated with a recapitalization and refinancing 
our results reflect twelve months of cardinal s operations  five and one half months of our operations after the merger and two months of operations of production management companies  inc  which we acquired effective november  consequently  analyzing prior period results to determine or estimate our future operating potential will be difficult given the accounting treatment of the cardinal merger  our subsequent acquisition of production management and the substantial non cash and extraordinary charges cardinal incurred prior to the merger 
overview we provide a broad range of specialized oilfield services and equipment to oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico and throughout the gulf coast region 
these services and equipment include well services including p a services  coiled tubing services  well pumping and stimulation services  data acquisition services  gas lift services and electric wireline services  mechanical wireline services  the rental of liftboats the rental of specialized oilfield equipment  environmental cleaning services  field management services  and the manufacture and sale of drilling instrumentation and oil spill containment equipment 
over the past few years  we have significantly expanded the geographic scope of our operations and the range of production related services that we provide through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
in july  we completed the cardinal acquisition  and in november  we completed the production management acquisition thereby making these companies two of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these acquisitions firmly established us as a market leader in providing most offshore production related services using liftboats as work platforms and allowed us to expand our scope of operations to include offshore platform and property management services 
the decline in drilling and workover activity in the gulf of mexico triggered by low oil prices that began in adversely affected our results of operations 
our operating results are directly tied to industry demand for our services  most of which are performed in the gulf of mexico 
while we have focused on providing production related services where  historically  demand has not been as volatile as for exploration related services  we expect our operating results to be highly leveraged to industry activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
for additional industry segment information for  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and our revenues were million compared to million for due to the accounting treatment required for the cardinal acquisition  our operating results reflected twelve months of cardinal s operations  five and one half months of our operations after the merger and two months of operations of production management 
reflects only cardinal s operations on a stand alone basis 
even though we had increased revenues in  we experienced decreased demand in in all of our operating segments as a result of low industry activity levels 
as demand for our services decreased in compared to  our gross margins decreased to in from in our decreased gross margin percentage is primarily due to our marine segment acquired in the cardinal acquisition 
since our marine segment s cost of services are primarily fixed in nature  our gross margin percentage may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization of our liftboats 
our rental tool segment contributed our highest gross margin percentage in and partially offset the decrease on a comparative basis since cardinal did not have a rental tool segment 
our wireline segment also experienced a decline in gross margin percentage in compared to our field management segment  which was acquired in the production management acquisition  contributed our lowest gross margin percentage 
of all of our production related services  the field management segment is expected to produce the lowest gross margin percentage since its largest cost of sales component is providing contract labor 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in most of the increase resulted from the larger asset base following the merger and the production management acquisition 
depreciation also increased as a result of our million of capital expenditures in and cardinal s acquisitions 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is the result of cardinal s expenses for twelve months  our expenses for five and one half months and production management for two months 
in july  in connection with the cardinal acquisition  we refinanced our combined debt  which resulted in an extraordinary charge of million  net of income taxes of million 
the majority of the extraordinary charge was non cash in nature 
during  cardinal incurred extraordinary charges of million  net of income taxes of million  in connection with a recapitalization and refinancing 
these charges were also mostly of a non cash nature 
we recorded a net loss before extraordinary charges of million  or loss per diluted share 
after extraordinary charges  we recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  for comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and the results of operations for the years ended december  and were prior to our acquisition of cardinal and  accordingly  reflect cardinal s results on a stand alone basis 
we do not believe cardinal s historical operating results under different management are relevant other than to demonstrate the operating leverage associated with our marine segment 
in  cardinal s operating results began to be impacted by the decline in industry activity levels in the gulf as a result of the decline in oil and gas prices 
the third quarter was impacted by a nearly continuous series of storms and hurricanes that significantly curtailed activity in september revenues for were million as compared to million for approximately of the increase was due to the additional products and services cardinal began providing in  including coiled tubing services  pumping and stimulation services and two additional foot liftboats 
the remaining was the result of acquisitions made during the gross margin was compared to for most of the decrease in gross margin was related to slightly higher labor costs associated with cardinal s acquisitions and new services 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in from million in most of the increase resulted from the larger asset base that resulted from cardinal s acquisitions as well as from capital expenditures of million  primarily for marine vessels 
general and administrative expenses were million for as compared to million for this increase was due to the acquisitions cardinal made in  additional sales expenses associated with an expanded marketing program  an increase in employee benefits and a one time stock award to management which was recorded as compensation expense 
interest expense increased to million for compared to million for this increase resulted from cardinal s higher debt levels following a recapitalization and refinancing 
other expenses for represent consulting fees that were paid to cardinal s previous owner prior to the recapitalization 
in  cardinal completed a recapitalization and refinancing which resulted in an extraordinary charge of million  net of income taxes of million  which included the unamortized estimated value of stock warrants that were redeemed for million and unamortized financing costs of million 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million for the increase was due principally to the merger with cardinal and acquisition of production management companies  inc our working capital at december  was million 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in december  we received a million insurance settlement that we will use to refurbish our liftboat that was damaged in september we have a term loan and revolving credit facility that was implemented in july to provide million term loan to refinance our long term debt after the cardinal acquisition  provide a million revolving credit facility and million that we can use to pay additional contingent consideration from our prior acquisitions 
we amended the credit facility in november to increase the term loan by million to refinance production management s existing indebtedness and to pay the cash portion of the acquisition price 
under the credit facility  the term loan requires quarterly principal installments that commenced december  in the amount of  and then increasing up to an aggregate of approximately million a quarter until when million will be due and payable 
the credit facility bears interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the term loan was million and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility was 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we maintain debt coverage and leverage ratios 
it also limits our ability to make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
in november  we acquired production management companies  inc for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
up to million will be potentially payable in the future based upon a multiple of four times production management s average earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization less certain other adjustments 
if the overall current industry activity levels continue  the additional consideration actually paid will be materially less than the maximum consideration 
in  we made capital expenditures of million primarily to further expand our rental tool equipment 
other capital expenditures included electric wireline skids  plug and abandonment equipment and capital improvements to our liftboats 
in september of  one of our two hundred foot class liftboats was damaged in the gulf of mexico 
in late december  we received a million insurance settlement for the damage  which is expected to pay for the vessel s refurbishment 
we have identified capital projects that will require approximately million for we believe that cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects and working capital requirements 
we expect to pay approximately million in the fourth quarter of for additional consideration related to our acquisitions 
the consideration will be capitalized as additional purchase price of the acquired companies  and we expect to use the million portion of the credit facility  which was designed to fund these payments 
we significantly increased our financial leverage in with the cardinal and production management acquisitions 
in  if market conditions improve  we will consider issuing equity to reduce our financial leverage 
we intend to continue implementing our acquisition strategy to increase our scope of services 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may also require additional equity or debt financing in excess of amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas no 
 as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
fas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are to be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
earlier application of the provisions of the statement is encouraged and is permitted as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after the issuance of the statement 
we have not yet assessed the financial impact of adopting this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates 
we make limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded with creditworthy major financial institutions 
at december   we were a party to interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million that were designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swaps mature in march and october  and the weighted average fixed interest rate is 
at december   the interest rate to be received by us averaged 
we consider these swaps to be a hedge against potentially higher future interest rates 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we would have recognized a gain of an estimated  had we terminated these agreements at december  at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense inclusive of swaps in the year by approximately million or million
