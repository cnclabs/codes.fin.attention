item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less consisting entirely of us government securities or government backed securities 
these investments are classified in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as available for sale securities and are stated at cost which approximates market 
as a result of the short term nature of the company s cash and cash equivalents  a change of market interest rates does not impact the company s operating results or cash flow 
the assets and liabilities of the company s united kingdom subsidiary are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates 
the effect of foreign currency translations was not material to the company s results of operations for the year ended december  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely effected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
the company s greatest sensitivity with respect to market risk is to changes in the general level of us interest rate and its effect upon the company s interest expense 
at december   the company had no long term or short term debt that bears interest at floating rates 
however  should the company incur borrowing under its credit agreement  such borrowings would bear interest at variable rates 
because these rates are variable  an increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rate would result in reduced interest expense 
the company does not use any derivative instruments to hedge its interest rate expense 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by the company s senior officers 
therefore  the company s exposure related to such derivative instruments is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
