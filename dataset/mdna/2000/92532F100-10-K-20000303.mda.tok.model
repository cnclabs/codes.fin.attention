item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains forward looking statements  which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those described 
factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to those described in the section entitled risk factors 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
we discover  develop and market small molecule drugs that address major medical needs 
we have seven drug candidates in clinical development to treat viral diseases  inflammation  cancer  autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders 
we have created our pipeline using a proprietary approach  information driven drug design  that integrates multiple technologies in biology  chemistry and biophysics aimed at increasing the speed and success rate of drug discovery 
our first approved product is agenerase tm amprenavir  an hiv protease inhibitor  which we co promote with glaxo wellcome plc glaxo wellcome 
we earned a royalty from glaxo wellcome from sales of agenerase in agenerase received us food and drug administration fda approval through an expedited review process for the treatment of hiv infection 
agenerase has also received approval in other countries  including japan where the drug is sold under the trade name prozei tm 
approval of agenerase is pending in other countries  including the european union  where the drug is being made available through early access programs 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur a loss in we believe that operating losses will continue beyond  even if significant royalties are realized on agenerase sales  as we are planning to make significant investments in research and development for our other potential products 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  the net loss for was  or per share compared to  or per share in our total revenues increased to  in from  in in  royalty and product sales revenue was  collaborative and other research and development revenue was  and investment income was  revenue in consisted of  in collaborative and other research and development and  in investment income 
royalties and product sales consist of agenerase royalty revenue of  from glaxo wellcome as well as initial sales of commercial drug substance to kissei in japan 
agenerase royalty revenue from glaxo wellcome was recognized for the first time in and is based upon worldwide net sales of agenerase as provided by glaxo wellcome 
these sales reflect prescriptions as well as initial trade stocking which is expected to be consistent with demand 
the growth in collaborative and other research and development revenue in  as compared with  is largely due to new collaborative agreements and larger milestone payments during the year 
in april of  we earned a  milestone payment from glaxo wellcome for us fda approval of agenerase 
we recorded  in collaborative revenue from aventis sa aventis  formerly hoechst marion roussel deutschland gmbh  in october of  upon entering into an expanded agreement covering the development of vx  an orally active inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme ice 
this consisted of a  payment for prior research costs and a  milestone payment for entering phase ii clinical trials 
in november  we agreed with taisho pharmaceutical co  ltd 
of japan to collaborate to discover  develop and commercialize caspase inhibitors for the treatment of cerebrovascular  cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases 
in connection with this contract  we recognized  for prior research costs and approximately  in product research funding 
included in collaborative and other research and development revenue is a  payment from schering ag earned in connection with the signing of a new collaborative agreement for our neurophilins ligand program and a  milestone payment from glaxo wellcome for the nda filing for agenerase 
research funding decreased from all collaborative partners  by approximately  in primarily because the research funding requirements under the glaxo wellcome agreement ended on december  interest income decreased in compared with due to a lower level of cash and investments throughout the year as well as lower yields earned on investment securities 
total costs and expenses increased to  in from  in royalties and product costs of  in consist of royalty payments to gd searle co 
searle and the cost of commercial drug substance sold to kissei 
under the terms of the license agreement between glaxo wellcome  searle and us  we agreed to pay searle a royalty on the sales of agenerase 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in principally due to the continued expansion of our research and development operations 
our uk subsidiary expanded from a business development operation to include scientific research and development staff in the second half of related to our expansion were increases in facilities expenses  lab supplies and increased equipment depreciation 
additionally  there was an increase in development expenses due to the commencement of clinical trials in the second half of and the increase in other development activities associated with our impdh inhibitor  vx  for psoriasis and hepatitis c  our neurophilins drug candidate  timcodar  for diabetic neuropathy  and our p map kinase inhibitor  vx  for inflammatory diseases 
we anticipate research and development expenses to continue to increase as personnel are added and additional research and development activities are expanded to accommodate our existing collaborations and additional commitments we may undertake in the future 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in primarily as a result of increased personnel and professional expenses associated with the marketing of agenerase tm and related corporate advertising activities 
legal and patent expenses increased as we continue to protect our intellectual property and contest a suit filed by chiron corporation chiron claiming infringement of three us patents issued to chiron 
while the final outcome of the litigation with chiron cannot be determined  we believe  based on information currently available  that the ultimate outcome of the action will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow and enter our first full year of agenerase sales 
in february  we restructured our investment in altus biologics altus  which was a wholly owned subsidiary 
as part of the transaction  we provided altus  of cash and surrendered our shares in altus preferred stock in exchange for two new classes of preferred stock and warrants 
altus now operates independently from us 
at december   we had a equity investment in altus of approximately  for the year ending december   we recorded  as our share of altus losses 
altus is expected to incur additional losses in and we will record our proportionate share of losses against the investment balance 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the net loss for was  or per share compared to  or per share in our total revenues were  in as compared to  in in  revenues consisted of  under our collaborative agreements   in investment income and  in government grants and other income 
collaborative revenue in included a  payment from schering ag associated with the signing of a collaborative agreement for our neurophilin ligand program and  of research funding from schering ag  a  milestone payment from kissei for the acceptance of vx as the lead development candidate for our p map kinase program  and a  milestone payment from glaxo wellcome for the nda filing of agenerase tm 
other collaborative revenue in included  from kissei   from glaxo wellcome   from eli lilly and company lilly and  from others 
in  revenues consisted of  under our collaborative agreements   in investment income  and  in government grants and other income 
revenue from collaborative agreements in consisted of  from glaxo wellcome   from hmr   from kissei   from lilly and  from others 
total costs and expenses increased to  in from  in research and development expenses increased to  in from  in we increased research staffing  including opening a research site in the uk  to fully staff a higher number of discovery programs 
in addition  we expanded our development infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses increased in to  from  in primarily as a result of headcount growth to handle the administrative requirements of our growing research and development operation  legal expenses associated with expansion of our intellectual property position and marketing expenses associated with the anticipated launch of agenerase tm and our co promotion preparations 
interest expense increased in to  from  in due to higher levels equipment financing during liquidity and capital resources our operations have been funded principally through strategic collaborative agreements  public offerings and private placements of our equity securities  equipment financing  government grants and investment income 
with the approval and launch of agenerase  we began receiving product royalty revenues in we have continued to increase and advance the products in our research and development pipeline 
consequently  we expect to incur increased research and development and related supporting expenses and are likely to continue experiencing losses on a quarterly and annual basis as we continue to develop existing and future compounds and to conduct clinical trials of potential drugs 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization expenditures in the future and additional expenses related to the filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to finance these substantial cash needs with royalties from the sales of agenerase  our existing cash and investments of approximately  at december  and investment income earned thereon  future payments under our existing and new collaborative agreements  facilities and equipment financing and to the extent available  by raising additional funds through public offerings or private placements of securities or other methods of financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in december of  we obtained a  line of credit 
the purpose of the line of credit is to fund equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures in connection with the expansion of facilities 
no amounts were outstanding as of december  we believe that our existing cash and investments should be sufficient to meet our anticipated requirements for at least the next two years 
our aggregate cash and investments decreased in by  to  at december  cash used by operations in  principally to fund research and development activities  was  property and equipment expenditures were  in   in and  in the expenditures were principally for research equipment and leasehold improvements to new and existing facilities 
in  we entered in new operating lease agreements for additional space and facilities in the us in connection with the new leases  we were required to provide security deposits in the form of stand by letters of credit in the amount of  which is reflected in the increase of restricted cash 
we intend to make significant investments in equipment and leasehold improvements in the future to support research and development activities 
at december   we leased approximately  square feet of office and research space in the us and  square feet in the uk we have also entered into an agreement to lease an additional  square feet of new facilities presently under construction 
the leases have expiration dates ranging from december to subject to extension for additional terms ending in in addition  our liability for capitalized equipment lease obligations and other equipment financing totaled approximately  at december  during  we repaid  of our lease obligations 
during  we entered into two new collaborative agreements 
in september  we entered into an expanded agreement with aventis covering the development of vx  an orally active inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme ice 
under the terms of the agreement aventis agreed to pay us  for prior research costs  up to  of development and commercialization milestone payments  and royalties on sales  if any 
in november  we entered into an agreement with taisho pharmaceutical co  ltd taisho to collaborate on the discovery  development and commercialization of caspase inhibitors for the treatment of cerebrovascular  cardiovascular and neurdegenerative diseases 
under the agreement  taisho agreed to pay us up to  in pre commercial payments  comprised of research funding  milestone payments and  in payments for prior research costs 
these amounts are based on the development of two compounds 
in addition  taisho will also pay for certain of the costs of developing compounds that emerge from the caspase research program 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab which is effective no later than the quarter ending march  sab clarifies the securities and exchange commission s views related to revenue recognition and disclosure 
we will adopt sab in the first quarter of and are presently determining the effect it will have on our financial statements  although the amount could be material to net financial results 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the effective date of this statement was deferred to fiscal years beginning after june  this statement requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial statements 
year beginning in late  we conducted a program to address the impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by our computer systems and software it systems  embedded systems in our non computer equipment non it systems and relationships with certain third parties 
in the first stage of the program  we determined which it systems  non it systems and third party relationships were critical to our business 
assessment  testing  and remediation of our critical it systems and non it systems for year compliance were completed by mid november  some non critical non it systems were non compliant and  because of the age of those systems or other factors  could not be made compliant 
we formulated contingency plans for each of those systems 
we also contacted third parties that provide goods  services and information that were deemed critical to our business 
based on our review of the responses and year website statements of those entities  we assessed our year compliance 
we formulated contingency plans for the services provided by third parties that were found to be non compliant  or where we were unable to determine whether a third party was compliant 
however  it has not proven necessary to implement any of the contingency plans  since there have been no significant year disruptions to the goods  services and information provided by critical third parties 
we used both internal and external resources to conduct our year program 
the total costs  both out of pocket and internal  of our year program were not material 
other it systems projects were not significantly deferred as a result of our year program  because we were able to integrate much of our year assessment and remediation efforts into our routine maintenance and upgrade programs 
we funded the year costs through available cash and have no remaining costs 
we have not to date experienced any significant problems with our own it and non it systems or third party relationships as a result of the january  date change 
there has been no material adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of year computer problems or the assessment  testing  and remediation program
