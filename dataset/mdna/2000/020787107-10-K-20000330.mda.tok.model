item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the company is an it professional services firm specializing in network design  operation  management  and security  offering related products and services to fortune and other large and mid sized companies located primarily in the new york to philadelphia corridor 
the company was formed in as an authorized reseller of computer hardware and software products  and since  has been developing and offering related it services 
to date  a majority of the company s net sales continue to be derived from it product sales 
however  as a result of the company s decision to de emphasize low end product sales and focus on the high end professional services market  the percentage of the company s revenue from product sales has declined sharply from approximately of total revenue in to approximately of total revenue in  while the percentage of revenue related to services has increased during the same period from approximately in to approximately in the company anticipates that this trend will continue in the company has entered into distribution agreements with ingram  pinacor and tech data  three of the nation s largest aggregators  to acquire most of its it products for resale 
the company s relationship with pinacor commenced in and  as customer demand for it products grew  the company initiated its relationship with ingram in the company initiated its relationship with tech data in the distribution agreements with pinacor  ingram and tech data give the company access to these aggregators extensive inventories and provide the company with electronic ordering capability  product configuration and testing  warehousing and delivery 
in general  the company orders it products  including workstations  servers  enterprise computing products  networking and communications equipment  and applications software from such aggregators on an as needed basis  thereby reducing the company s need to carry large inventories 
during  the company acquired approximately  and of its products for resale from ingram  pinacor and tech data  respectively 
except for the mta contract entered into in december  there are no ongoing written commitments by customers to purchase products from the company and all product sales are made on a purchase order basis 
as the market for it products has matured  price competition has intensified and is likely to continue to intensify 
during and  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations were adversely affected by such continued product pricing pressure and by a significant reduction in product purchase orders from the company s customers 
in addition  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations could be adversely affected by a disruption in the company s sources of product supply 
the company offers enterprise network management  information security  internet related  emobile solutions  applications development  professional development  help desk  and workstation support services 
services and support revenue is recognized as such services are performed 
most of the company s services are billed on a time and materials basis 
the company s professional development and services are fee based on a per course basis 
generally  the company s service arrangements with its customers may be terminated by such customers with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
the most significant cost relating to the services component of the company s business is personnel costs  which consist of salaries  benefits and payroll related expenses 
thus  the financial performance of the company s service business is based primarily upon billing margins billable hourly rates less the costs to the company of such service personnel on an hourly basis and utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
the future success of the services component of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain high utilization rates at profitable billing margins 
the competition for quality technical personnel has continued to intensify resulting in increased personnel costs for the company and many other it service providers 
this intense competition has caused the company s billing margins to be lower than they might otherwise have been 
the company implemented a reduction in force in june due to lower than expected demand for the company s services from certain clients 
in january  the company implemented a second reduction  eliminating positions  consisting principally of persons supporting product sales which  as noted earlier  the company is de emphasizing 
adjustments to the size of the company s workforce will continue as necessary in order for the company to meet the needs of its clients 
the company may receive manufacturer rebates resulting from equipment sales 
in addition  the company receives volume discounts and other incentives from certain of its suppliers 
except for products in transit or products awaiting configuration at a company facility  the company generally does not maintain large inventory balances 
the company s primary vendors have announced or instituted changes in their price protection and inventory management programs as a direct result of changes in such policies by manufacturers 
specifically  they have announced that they will i limit price protection to that provided by the manufacturer  generally less than days  rather than the unlimited protection previously available  and ii restrict product returns  other than defective returns  to a percentage the percentage varies depending on the vendor and when the return is made of product purchased  during a defined period  at the lower of the invoiced price or the current price  subject to the specific manufacturer s requirements and restrictions 
at the present time  the company does not believe these changes in the vendor policies will have a material impact on its business 
other than changes in such price protection and return policies  the company is unaware that any of its suppliers or manufacturers have changed or intend to further change these programs 
there can be no assurances that any such rebates  discounts or incentives will continue at historical levels  if at all 
further adverse modification  restriction or reduction in such programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company s cost of sales includes primarily  in the case of product sales  the cost to the company of products acquired for resale  and in the case of services and support revenue  salaries and related expenses for billable technical personnel 
the company s selling  general and administrative costs consist of operating expenses  including personnel and related costs  such as sales commissions earned by employees involved in the sales of it products  services and support 
personnel costs also include direct sales  marketing and sales support  and general and administrative personnel costs 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
during the last three fiscal years  the gross margins earned on services and support sales decreased from for  to for  and then increased to for the previous decline in gross margins was attributable to increased competition  lower utilization rates  the impact of the mta contract  and services and support revenue increasing at a slower rate than related personnel and recruiting costs 
also  declines in product and services support sales resulted in lower utilization rates and margins 
in response to these trends  the company emphasized its higher margin  value added services and support offerings  including network integration  applications development and internet related offerings 
as a result of the focus on higher margin services  the gross margins earned in increased to 
the company believes that its ability to provide a broad range of technical services  coupled with its traditional strength in satisfying its customers it product requirements and its long term relationships with large customers  positions the company to continue growing the services component of its business 
as such  the company anticipates that an increasing percentage of its gross profits in the future will be derived from the services and support component of its business 
however  in the near term  the company believes that product sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of the company s gross profit 
the company believes that  as a single source provider of it products  services and support  it is able to earn margins higher than it would earn if it sold products only 
the company s net sales  gross profit  operating income and net income have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and are expected to do so in the future 
many factors  some of which are not within the company s control  have contributed and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include the short term nature of the company s customers commitments  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing  size  and mix of product and service orders and deliveries  the timing and size of new projects  pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  market factors affecting the availability of qualified technical personnel  timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings  changes in trends affecting outsourcing of it services  disruption in sources of supply  changes in product  personnel  and other operating costs  and industry and general economic conditions 
operating results have been and may in the future also be affected by the cost  timing and other effects of acquisitions  including the mix of revenues of acquired companies 
the company believes  therefore  that past operating results and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future operating performance 
the company s operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by changes in technical personnel billing and utilization rates 
many of the company s costs  particularly costs associated with services and support revenue  such as administrative support personnel and facilities costs  are primarily fixed costs 
the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
technical personnel utilization rates have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected during periods of rapid and concentrated hiring 
depending upon the availability of qualified technical personnel  during periods of rapid growth  the company has utilized  and in the future is likely to utilize  contract personnel  which adversely affects gross margins 
if the company continues to successfully expand its service offerings  periods of variability in utilization may continue to occur 
in addition  the company is likely to incur greater technical training costs during such periods 
in december  the company entered into a four year  million contract with the mta to furnish and install local and wide area computer network components including network and telecommunications hardware  software and cabling throughout the mta s over locations 
the aggregate amount of this contract was subsequently increased to million 
the company is the prime contractor on this project and is responsible for project management  systems procurement  and installation 
the work is grouped in contiguous locations and payment is predicated upon achieving specific milestone events 
in the event of default  in addition to all other remedies at law  the mta reserves the right to terminate the services of the company and complete the mta contract itself at the company s cost 
in the event of unexcused delay by the company  the company may be obligated to pay  as liquidated damages  the sum of to per day 
while the company is currently performing in accordance with the contract terms  there can be no assurance that any such events of default or unexcused delays would not occur 
in addition  the mta contract is a fixed unit price contract  and the quantities are approximate  for which the mta has expressly reserved the right  for each item  to direct the amount of equipment be increased  decreased  or omitted entirely on days notice 
the mta has the right to suspend the work on days notice for up to days and or terminate the contract  at any time  on notice  paying only for the work performed to the date of termination 
the project is subject to the prevailing wage rate and classification for telecommunications workers  managed by the new york city controller s office  over which the company has no control  and which is generally adjusted in june of each year and may be so adjusted in the future 
the company has performed services and supplied products to the mta since the inception of the mta contract 
the work performed to date at mta sites has required greater than originally estimated labor and other costs to complete 
in may  the company submitted a formal request to the mta for equitable adjustment in the amount of approximately million and for a time extension 
this request was supplemented with a further submission in october in january  the project manager for the mta contract denied the company s request  thereby triggering the company s right under the contract to appeal the project manager s denial to the mta s dispute resolution office the dro 
the company filed its notice of appeal with the dro in february  and pursuant to the dro s request  filed a further written submission with the dro on march  it is not yet known when or how the dro will rule on the company s appeal 
under the terms of the mta contract  the company is entitled to appeal any adverse determination of the dro to the trial level court in the state of new york 
the company believes that its request for equitable adjustment constitutes a valid claim under the mta contract 
there can be no assurance the mta will approve  either in whole or in part  any equitable adjustment in the contract amount or terms requested by the company 
however  as a result of changes in work rules and operating procedures  increased cooperation from mta personnel  realization of increased operating efficiencies  improvements in project management and potential outsourcing of certain future cabling work  the company currently estimates that aggregate costs will approximate contract revenues  excluding any equitable adjustment which may be approved by the mta 
consequently  the company is recording revenues under the mta contract equal to costs incurred 
for the years ended december  and  revenues recorded in connection with the mta contract amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  and no profit has been recognized 
year readiness disclosure historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in such programs recognizing a date using as the year rather than the year this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to herein as the year problem 
computer systems that are represented by manufacturers as being able to deal correctly with dates after are referred to as year compliant 
over the past several years  based upon its business needs  the company has purchased and installed hardware and software that are represented by the manufacturers to be year compliant 
in july  the company replaced its former integrated accounting system  which was not year compliant  with platinum sql software  which is year compliant 
based upon the representations of the manufacturers of hardware and software used by the company  and the provider of the platinum sql software  the company believes that all of its internal business systems  including its computer systems  are year compliant 
the company resells it products of leading hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  the company has no control over the developments of such third parties computer systems  software products or other business systems developed by such third parties 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the computer systems  software products or other business systems sold by the company are year compliant 
the company  as a reseller  may be liable for non year compliant product it resells 
however  to date  the company has not received any claims with respect to year compliance 
given the company s role in the distribution of such products  the company is not able to accurately determine the extent  if any  of such potential liability 
the total cost of the company s year compliance has been funded through operating cash flows 
the costs incurred to date to purchase and install platinum sql were approximately million 
excluding costs associated with platinum sql and the write off of the capitalized software and consulting fees during  the company expended approximately million in and on hardware and software upgrades for its year compliance 
the company does not currently anticipate that it will incur any additional material expenditures for such year compliance 
these costs do not include any costs associated with any third party being non year compliant  nor do such costs include internal personnel costs primarily salaries and benefits  which the company does not separately track and do not include any contingency plan costs

many of the services performed by the company in prior years such as desktop support services  configuration and installation were performed to support the product sales 
as the overall product business declines  this type of service revenue also declines 
the company is now focusing on providing services and support that are independent of product sales such as security  training  and network operations support 
product sales in of million decreased  or million  from million in the prior year 
the decline in product sales is primarily due to substantially reduced business from two predominantly low margin product accounts  partially offset by increased business with other customers  as well as lower average selling prices due to increased competition and product pricing pressures 
this trend has been accelerated by the ability of customers to purchase directly from certain manufacturers at discounted prices and the company s decision not to focus its resources on the pursuit of low margin product business
