in order to increase the quantity and selection of newly released video titles and satisfy the customer s demand while trying to mitigate the company s risk  we entered into revenue sharing agreements with major studios 
prior to these revenue sharing agreements  the company paid approximately to per videocassette for major theatrical releases that were priced for rental in the united states 
the company was seldom able to fully satisfy its customer s demand for new releases under this fixed price model 
the company expected that the revenue sharing model would have a significant impact on the company s cost of rental as it changed its business model from a primarily fixed to a primarily variable cost approach 
starting in the fourth quarter of  revenue sharing payments became a significant component of the company s cost of rental 
the revenue sharing agreements made it necessary for the company to make adjustments to its inventory valuation as of october  in order to account for the shorter rental lives that videocassettes have in the revenue sharing business model because initial customer demand is satisfied significantly sooner

liquidity and capital resources the company generates substantial operating cash flow because most of its revenue is received in cash 
the amount of cash generated from operations in significantly exceeded debt service requirements of the company s long term obligations 
the capital expenditures including purchases of rental inventory of the company are primarily funded by the excess operating cash flow and through loans under a revolving line of credit 
the company currently has a million revolving line of credit available to address the timing of certain working capital and capital expenditure disbursements 
the company is negotiating to replace its current million line of credit with a new million facility  consisting of a million revolving line of credit and million term loan 
the company expects to close on the new credit facility in april may the company believes cash flow from operations  supplemented by the availability of the new credit facility  will provide the company with adequate liquidity and the capital necessary to achieve its planned expansion for the foreseeable future 
the company has increased its focus on maximizing cash generation and return on invested capital 
after being a net user of cash since its inception  the company expects to become a net generator of cash in the fourth quarter of due to its large and highly profitable base of stores  the company s cash from operations is expected to be large enough to pay interest  cash taxes  and all growth and maintenance capital expenditures  and have significant cash remaining to reduce the company s debt 
to accelerate this free cash flow milestone  the company has announced that it is slowing the growth of its superstore base from a historical stores per year  down to to stores per year 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
rental inventories are accounted for as noncurrent assets under gaap because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of the company s revenue  the classification of these assets as noncurrent excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  the company believes working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as a noncurrent asset  the company may  from time to time  operate with a working capital deficit 
cash provided by operating activities during  net cash generated by operations was million lower than the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower depreciation and amortization expenses  net of the non cash inventory valuation charge and the write off of purchased in process research and development costs in see results of operations  combined with a net unfavorable change in certain working capital accounts  partially offset by a net favorable change in deferred income taxes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by million from the prior year primarily due to reduced purchases of rental inventory for new and existing stores excluding product purchased under revenue sharing agreements  a decrease in investment in businesses acquired and reduced capital expenditures with respect to new store construction  remodeling of certain existing stores and for the continued development of management information systems see capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million from the prior year 
in the prior year  the company sold million shares of its common and preferred stock in connection with the reel 
com acquisition for an aggregate amount of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for approximately million 
in  the company had an increase in indebtedness repaid resulting from the payment of the million note due in april  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures include product for stores  store equipment and fixtures  remodeling a certain number of existing stores  implementing and upgrading office and store technology and opening for new store locations 
each new store opening requires initial capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  inventory  equipment and costs related to site location  lease negotiations and construction permits 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures of approximately million will be incurred in  of which million is anticipated to relate to new  relocated and remodeled stores and the conversion of acquired stores 
the remaining balance relates to corporate capital expenditures 
we expect the total investment per new store to approximate  which includes rental and merchandise inventory  leasehold improvements  signage  furniture  fixtures and equipment 
we have brought down the cost from over  per store in through improved construction and product efficiencies 
the cost of opening a new store can vary based on size  construction costs in a particular market  and other factors 
these capital expenditures will be funded primarily by cash generated from operations  supplemented by the availability of a new senior revolving line of credit or other forms of equipment financing and or leasing  if necessary 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than year to be in year compliance a computer program must be written using four digits to define years 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may have required upgrading to comply with such year yk requirements 
the century rollover to january  went extremely well for hollywood entertainment corporation 
all mission critical systems performed as anticipated 
the thousands of programs and applications that had been remediated continued to function without interruption or failure as we moved into the year hollywood continues to monitor date related systems matters 
based upon the performance of our programs  applications  and systems to date  we believe that yk issues are no longer of any material concern to the company and its business 
the cost of the yk effort was approximately million 
general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality the company anticipates that its business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including variations in the number and timing of new store openings  the performance of new or acquired stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  weather  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
in addition  any concentration of new store openings and the related new store pre opening costs and other expenses associated with the opening of new stores near the end of a fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on the financial results for that quarter and could  in certain circumstances  lead to fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
the company believes these seasonality trends will continue
