item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed below and in the section entitled risk factors 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to cytel are to cytel corporation  all references to epimmune are to epimmune inc  a majority owned subsidiary of cytel  until july   at which time cytel and epimmune merged  and all references to the we  us or our company are to the combined entity of cytel and epimmune 
on july   we completed a series of transactions the exchange transactions in which we i transferred all of the outstanding shares of epimmune s series b preferred stock then held by cytel to gd searle co 
searle in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of cytel s series b preferred stock  ii issued  shares of cytel s series s preferred stock and  shares of cytel s series s preferred stock to searle in exchange for all outstanding shares of epimmune s series b preferred stock and series b preferred stock and iii issued a total of  shares of cytel s common stock to the holders of common stock of epimmune in exchange for all outstanding shares of epimmune s common stock 
the acquisition of the minority interest in epimmune  through the exchange transaction  was accounted for as a purchase 
we recorded the acquisition of the minority interest at the fair market value of the preferred and common stock issued  and determined that the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets of million was in process technology based on a discounted cash flow analysis of that technology 
the analysis  with a discount rate of  was based on estimated research and development costs for nine years and product revenues beginning in year six  after the assumed completion of clinical trials and product approval by the fda 
the analysis also considered milestone payments based on scientific accomplishments  and new collaborative revenues based on projected future collaboration agreements 
the value of the technology was charged to acquired in process technology because technological feasibility had not been achieved nor had alternative future uses for the technology been identified 
following the exchange transactions  cytel merged with epimmune and changed its name to epimmune inc as of december   searle owned of our outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding preferred stock since cytel s inception in july  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the discovery and development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic products 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have funded our research and development primarily from equity derived working capital and through strategic alliances with other companies 
we have been unprofitable since our inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in the first quarter of  cytel completed the sale of its glytec carbohydrate synthesis and manufacturing business resulting in net proceeds of approximately million see note in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  cytel announced the results from its cylexin phase ii iii clinical trial which indicated that cylexin  cytel s lead therapeutic compound  showed no benefit over the placebo 
accordingly  cytel terminated its therapeutic anti inflammatory business and  as a result  cytel recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter  which was subsequently reduced to million in the fourth quarter see note in the consolidated financial statements 
we are now focused exclusively on the development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion reflects historical financial information for both cytel and epimmune on a combined basis 
we have financed operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  two public common stock offerings  revenues under collaborative research and development agreements  grant revenues  certain asset divestitures and interest income 
through december  we had raised approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
in february  we completed a private placement of newly issued shares of common stock  which raised net proceeds of million 
we have financed our laboratory equipment and research and office facilities primarily through operating lease arrangements and a note payable 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments decreased to million as compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to cash used for epimmune operations and payment of liabilities associated with the wind down of cytel operations  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of cytel s glytec business discussed above  the sale of certain other cytel assets totaling million and the receipt of a million milestone payment from searle 
we expect to continue to use our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our ongoing vaccine research programs 
we had net working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december  for the year ended december   our capital expenditures totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures made in were primarily for furniture and leasehold improvements for our new laboratory and office facility  which was completed in april capital expenditures made in were primarily for manufacturing and laboratory equipment additions for cytel s glytec carbohydrate manufacturing facility 
cytel has since sold its glytec carbohydrate synthesis and manufacturing business  terminated its anti inflammatory therapeutic business and sold all remaining cytel fixed assets in future capital expenditures will be in support of our vaccine business 
we expect to incur operating losses over the next several years due to continuing expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical testing and clinical trials 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of revenues received and expenses incurred  and such fluctuations may be substantial 
we expect our existing resources  including funds raised in the first quarter of  will be sufficient to find operations through we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenditures  including costs related to preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing  as well as marketing and distribution expenses 
it is our intention to seek additional collaborative research and development relationships with suitable corporate partners 
we cannot be certain that any agreements that may result from these discussions will successfully reduce our funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing will be required  and we cannot be certain that these funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our drug discovery or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing research relationships  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of our drug discovery programs  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
as is typical in the biotechnology industry  our commercial success will depend in part on neither infringing patents issued to competitors nor breaching the technology licenses upon which our products might be based 
our business is also subject to other significant risks  including the uncertainties associated with our current collaboration and our ability to enter new collaborations  and the lengthy regulatory approval process and with potential competition from other products 
even if our products appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
such reasons include  but are not limited to our inability to fund clinical development of such products  or the possibilities that the potential products will be found ineffective during clinical trials  fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or be uneconomical to market 
results of operations we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in total revenues increased in from  due to research revenues and milestone payments received from our collaborative agreement with searle 
total revenues decreased in from due to the decline in revenues from cytel s collaboration agreements 
included in total revenues were research grant revenues of million in  million in  and million in research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to the discontinuation of research efforts on cylexin and other cytel technologies 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in due to increased manufacturing expenses for cytel and research activity performed by epimmune 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in due primarily to termination of cytel operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to the increase in general and administrative personnel at epimmune 
in march  cytel recorded a restructuring charge of million for the termination of its non epimmune operations 
subsequently  in the fourth quarter  the restructuring charge was reduced to million  primarily due to early lease terminations and higher than projected proceeds received from the sale of assets 
in  we charged to operations million for the write off of in process technology related to the acquisition of the minority interest in epimmune 
we issued common and preferred stock to outside investors in epimmune to acquire the minority interest in epimmune 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we recorded a million loss on permanent impairment of intangible assets in based on the decision to terminate cytel s therapeutic anti inflammatory business 
the write down was equal to the book value of cytel s cell adhesion patent portfolio 
other income in includes million from elan international services  ltd 
elan in consideration of the buyout of certain future milestone obligations by elan 
in  we recorded a gain of million on sales and disposal of assets as compared to a million loss in the gain relates to the sale of cytel s glytec carbohydrate synthesis and manufacturing business 
net interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in from was due to a lower average cash balance 
in and  average cash balances were roughly comparable  resulting in level net interest income year over year 
year in prior years  we discussed the nature and progress of our plans to become year ready 
in late  we completed our remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believe those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
we incurred expenses of less than  during in connection with remediating our systems 
we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
we will continue to monitor our mission critical computer applications and those of our suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that we promptly address any latent year matters that may arise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our investment portfolio consists of money market funds and short term  high quality debt securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
an immediate change in interest rates would not harm our business
