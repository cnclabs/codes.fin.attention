item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general you should read the following discussion and analysis together with the consolidated financial statements of apex silver mines limited and the selected financial data and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
apex limited is a mining exploration and development company that holds a portfolio of silver exploration and development properties primarily in south america and central america 
none of these properties are in production and  consequently  we have no current operating income or cash flow 
we currently focus our resources on the development of our san cristobal project in bolivia as well as continued evaluation of our cobrizos property in bolivia and platosa property in mexico 
our company completed an initial public offering of ordinary shares on december  we completed a subsequent offering of ordinary shares and warrants during november as used herein  apex limited  our company  we and our refer collectively to apex silver mines limited  its predecessors  subsidiaries and affiliates as to one or more of them as the context may require 
results of operations interest income 
our company does not yet produce silver or any other mineral products and has no revenues from product sales 
our primary source of revenue is interest income 
our policy is to invest all excess cash in liquid  high credit quality  short term financial instruments 
our interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income compared to is the result of declining average cash balances during prior to receipt of the net proceeds of our november offering of ordinary shares and warrants 
the increase in our interest income for compared to was due to the additional cash raised in our initial public offering of ordinary shares in exploration 
our company expenses mineral exploration expenditures as incurred on each property until we determine that mining operations on that property are feasible 
once we have determined that a mineral property has proven and probable ore reserves  we capitalize all development costs 
through december   we have expensed all acquisition and exploration costs as incurred  except those pertaining to the san cristobal project 
since september   we have capitalized development costs associated with the san cristobal project and will continue to do so in the future 
our exploration expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in our exploration expenses for these periods is due primarily to the reduced emphasis on exploration as we concentrate our resources on the development of the san cristobal project 
administrative 
our administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily due to the refocusing of our efforts on development activities at the san cristobal project 
the increase in our administrative expenses for compared to is primarily the result of our increased activity and our hiring of additional personnel associated with the anticipated development and financing of the san cristobal project 
income taxes 
apex silver mines corporation  our us management services company  is subject to us income taxes 
otherwise our company pays no income tax in the us since we are incorporated in the cayman islands and conduct no business that currently generates us taxable income 
the cayman islands currently impose no corporate taxation 
our company has been granted exemption until january  from any form of corporate taxation which may subsequently be adopted in the cayman islands 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million compared to million at december  the increase in our cash and cash equivalents during is due to the million in net proceeds we received from our november offering of ordinary shares and warrants  partially offset by our investments of approximately million in the development of the san cristobal mine and million in plant  buildings and equipment  together with million in other expenditures related primarily to exploration and administration 
during november  pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  we sold  ordinary share units  resulting in proceeds before commissions and fees of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million 
the ordinary share units  each priced at per unit  were comprised of one ordinary share and one warrant with each warrant exercisable into one half of an ordinary share at any time on or before november  at a price of per ordinary share 
the warrants  if exercised  would raise an additional million for the company and would result in the issuance of  ordinary shares 
based on the september feasibility study for the san cristobal project  we expect capital costs for construction to total approximately million 
in addition  we expect that the project will require million of working capital and million to pay bolivian value added tax during construction 
we should recover the value added tax against our future bolivian income taxes 
based on our current development schedule for san cristobal  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million over the next twelve months  with the remaining million to be spent in the following two years 
we expect to fund these expenditures from a combination of our existing cash balances and financing raised from outside sources 
under the current schedule  we expect our existing cash balances to be sufficient to fund ongoing development of san cristobal through the third quarter of we will need significant additional financing from outside sources to complete san cristobal development 
we expect that outside sources of financing for san cristobal will include bank borrowings and future additional debt or equity financing 
our company does not currently have a line of credit with any financial institution 
we have appointed barclays and deutsche bank as co lead arrangers for the project financing of the san cristobal project and have begun negotiations regarding the terms of a potential financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the required financing on terms that we find attractive  or at all 
in order to maintain our mineral properties  we must make certain payments including government mineral patent fees and commissions  work commitments  lease and option payments and advance royalties 
in order to maintain our current portfolio of mineral properties  we will be required to make payments during the next twelve months of approximately million for san cristobal  million for cobrizos  million for platosa and million for our other exploration properties 
in addition  we expect to make expenditures for other continuing exploration  property acquisition  property evaluation and general corporate expenses 
such expenditures are not anticipated to increase significantly during the next twelve months 
we expect to fund these obligations from existing cash balances 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
our management expects to be able to comply with those laws and does not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with its mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with best contemporary industry practice

volatility in market prices for silver  zinc and lead  
financial market conditions  and the availability of financing on terms acceptable to our company

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  our major principal cash balances are held in us dollars 
we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and therefore have a relative low exposure to currency fluctuations 
because we conduct our activities largely in several foreign countries  we may in the future engage in hedging activities to minimize the risk of exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations 
we expect that we will be required to hedge some portion of our planned production in advance in order to complete the financing necessary to develop san cristobal 
in addition  as we bring san cristobal into production and begin to derive revenue from the production  sale and exchange of metals  we may utilize various price hedging techniques to lock in forward delivery prices on a portion of our production 
we would expect to balance the use of price hedging techniques to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce while allowing us to take advantage of rising metal prices should they occur 
we are currently developing policies  procedures and guidelines for the hedging of metal prices  interest rates and foreign currency exposure 
we have engaged in limited metals trading activities utilizing puts and calls in a manner similar to anticipated lender requirements  for the purpose of testing procedures and controls surrounding the trading function 
at december   a mark to market of our open positions did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurance that we will always benefit from the use of hedging techniques
