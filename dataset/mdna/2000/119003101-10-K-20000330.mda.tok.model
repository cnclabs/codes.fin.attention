general all amounts relate to continuing operations unless noted otherwise 
prior to the acquisition of bracc  the company was the largest bracc franchisee in the united states and was one of the largest independent retailers of late model automobiles in the united states 
in  we embarked on a strategy to significantly expand our budget franchise base and to develop a branded retail car sales operation within budget franchise territories 
beginning in  we began acquiring and expanding into other rental related businesses 
we believe this strategy both leveraged management s experience and created certain operating efficiencies between complementary businesses 
in  budget adopted plans to dispose of its non core assets  primarily its car sales segment  cruise america and vpsi  in order to focus on car and truck rental 
the net income loss and net assets to be disposed of for these non core assets are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under the headings discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations and net assets of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet

income loss from continuing operations for decreased million to a loss of million from income of million in the income loss from continuing operations per share for decreased to a loss of per diluted share from income of per diluted share in due to the decrease in earnings  partially offset by an increase in the average number of shares outstanding 
income loss before income taxes decreased million in to a loss of million from income of million for income loss before income taxes in reflects million in charges as mentioned above compared to restructuring and other non recurring charges in of million and debt extinguishment costs of million in largely for class a common stock issued to induce conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes 
ryder trs experienced approximately million in losses before taxes for the year ended december   as compared to earnings of million for seven months ended december  operating revenues 
vehicle rental revenue increased million or in to  million from  million in this increase was largely due to the full year impact of ryder s operations  acquired in the second quarter of  which added a significant number of locations and vehicles to the company s operations  an increase in bracc due to an increase in volume and a million increase in europe due to volume and the effect of acquisitions and newly opened locations 
royalty fees and other revenues increased million in to million from million in these revenues largely represent royalty and other fees from the company s franchisees as a result of the bracc acquisition and revenue from ryder trs s move management service 
ryder trs revenue increased million in total revenue and million in royalty fees and other revenues in over operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million in to  million from  million in this increase was also largely due to the full year impact of ryder trs s operations versus the seven month impact in  the fourth quarter non recurring charges and additional fleet cost impact for bracc and international operations in ryder trs s increase in total operating expenses totaled million in direct vehicle and operating expenses increased million in to million from million in reflecting the full year impact of ryder trs  a portion of the one time and non recurring charges discussed above million  as well as a reduction in insurance reserves of approximately million in this reduction was due to changes in actuarial estimates of losses based on continued favorable trends in the frequency and severity of accidents as well as changes in claims handling procedures implemented in and early excluding the insurance adjustment  the impact of ryder trs and the non recurring items  direct vehicle and operating expenses increased slightly as a percent of total revenue largely due to increases in net vehicle damage  reconditioning expenses and mileage related penalties of approximately million 
vehicle depreciation increased million in to million from million in reflecting the full year effect of ryder trs s operations and volume increases in bracc car rental operations in the us and europe 
as a percent of rental revenue  vehicle depreciation decreased slightly due to improved utilization  largely in the us selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million from million in this increase was also largely due to the one time and non recurring items mentioned above of million in and the full year effect of ryder trs s operations 
amortization and non vehicle depreciation expense increased million in to million from million in this increase was largely due to intangibles  including goodwill  and property and equipment related to the acquisition of ryder trs in june we expect a similar increase in resulting from capital expenditures 
we recorded restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of of million largely related to severance and related costs and location closing expenses 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other expense  net of interest income  increased million in to million from million in this increase was due to the financing of fleet and other borrowings related to ryder trs fleet and an increase in interest rates due to our mix in debt and to a general rise in rates 
these increases were partially offset by non recurring debt extinguishment costs in provision benefit for income taxes 
the tax benefit differs from the statutory rate largely due to the effect of the distributions on trust preferred securities shown below the provision at its gross amount while the tax benefit is included in the provision and the impact of state and local income taxes net of the federal benefit  somewhat offset by the effects of non deductible intangible amortization 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
distributions on trust preferred securities 
the distributions on trust preferred securities of million in represents a full year of dividend payments to holders of these company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities issued by a subsidiary of the company in june these distributions are reflected as a minority interest under the above mentioned caption 
discontinued operations 
on december  we adopted plans to sell or dispose of our car sales segment  as well as certain non core assets and subsidiaries  primarily cruise america and vpsi 
the car sales locations are expected to be disposed of by september  and cruise america and vpsi have estimated disposal dates of mid year the assets of the operations to be sold consist primarily of vehicles  accounts receivable and property and equipment 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
during we accrued million  net of income tax benefits  for losses expected upon disposition of the discontinued operations and estimated losses through the phase out period 
we do not expect any other significant negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations related to the discontinued operations  however  the ultimate impact is somewhat dependent upon the timing and nature of the disposition 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  general operating results 
income from continuing operations for decreased million to income of million from income of million in the income from continuing operations per share for decreased to per diluted share from income of per diluted share in due to the decrease in earnings  partially offset by an increase in the average number of shares outstanding 
income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased million in to million from million for the company also recognized an extraordinary loss in of million  net of income tax benefits  related to the early extinguishment of guaranteed senior notes and ryder trs s senior subordinated notes 
income before income taxes reflects debt extinguishment costs of million in largely for class a common stock issued to induce conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
ryder trs contributed approximately million in earnings before taxes for the seven months ended december  operating revenues 
vehicle rental revenue increased million in to  million from million in this increase was largely due to the full year impact of bracc s operations  acquired in the second quarter of and the ryder trs acquisition in the second quarter of  which added a significant number of locations and vehicles to the company s operations 
royalty fees and other revenues increased million in to million from million in these revenues largely represent royalty and other fees from the company s franchisees as a result of the bracc acquisition and revenue from ryder trs s move management service 
ryder trs contributed million in total revenue and million of royalty fees and other revenues 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million in to  million from million in this increase was also largely due to the addition of bracc s and ryder trs s operations to the company s operations 
ryder trs s operating expenses totaled million in direct vehicle and operating expenses reflect a reduction in insurance reserves of approximately million in this reduction was due to changes in actuarial estimates of losses based on continued favorable trends in the frequency and severity of accidents as well as changes in claims handling procedures implemented within the past months 
excluding the insurance adjustment and the impact of ryder trs  direct vehicle and operating expenses increased slightly as a percent of vehicle rental revenue due to increases in vehicle damage  reconditioning expenses and mileage related penalties of approximately million on an annualized basis 
the increases in reconditioning and mileage related penalties occurred largely in the latter part of due to changes in terms of certain manufacturer s buyback programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million from million in this increase was also largely due to the addition of bracc and ryder trs s operations to the company s operations and also includes a provision of approximately million for bad debts in related to collection inefficiencies brought about by centralization efforts largely in international administrative functions 
amortization and non vehicle depreciation expense increased million in to million from million in this increase was largely due to intangibles  including goodwill  and property and equipment related to the acquisitions of bracc and ryder trs and the previously referred to impairment loss 
the company recorded restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of of million largely related to severance and related costs and location closing expenses 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other expense  net of interest income  increased million in to million from million in this increase was due to the financing of fleet and other borrowings related to the acquisitions of bracc and ryder trs  net of investment income due to the increase in restricted cash  and million in debt extinguishment costs related to the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the tax provision differs from the statutory rate largely due to the effect of the distributions on trust preferred securities shown below the provision at its gross amount while the tax benefit is included in the provision and changes in valuation allowances somewhat offset by the effects of non deductible intangible amortization and the impact of state and local income taxes net of the federal benefit 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
distributions on trust preferred securities 
the distributions on trust preferred securities of million represents dividend payments to holders of these company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities issued by a subsidiary of budget group 
these distributions are reflected as a minority interest under the above mentioned caption 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s operations have been funded by cash provided from operating activities and by financing provided by banks  automobile manufacturers captive finance companies  leasing companies and asset backed notes 
the company s primary use of cash is the acquisition of new vehicles for the rental fleet 
the indebtedness at december   has interest rates ranging from to and the material terms of the financing facilities are described below 
the company intends to fund its fleet financing requirements and debt maturities through asset backed notes and revolving credit facilities with financial institutions for fleet financing and working capital  as well as through other similar facilities 
analysis of cash flows net cash provided by continuing operations operating activities increased to million during from million during net cash provided by continuing operating activities during increased from million during during  we experienced an increase in cash provided due to an increase of million in the non cash charges component of our losses related to depreciation and amortization and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses reflecting the non recurring charges and timing on payments to vendors somewhat offset by an increase in receivables  prepaid expenses and other assets and the non cash benefit for income taxes 
the increase in receivables in reflects the difficulties we experienced in converting several new systems causing a slow down in the billing and collection of trade receivables somewhat offset by a lower level of amounts receivable for vehicle sales reflecting changes in the timing of disposals 
in and  we experienced increases in cash received from rentals which were offset to some extent by increases in cash paid to vendors and employees and in interest expense 
net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
this cash use is mainly offset by cash received from the sale of vehicles most of which sales were pursuant to manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs 
cash received from the sale of vehicles was  million   million and  million during  and  respectively 
cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles was  million   million and  million during  and  respectively 
the increase in cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles during was primarily the result of the increased number of vehicles in service during largely due to volume growth for bracc and the full year impact of ryder trs 
payment for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  amounted to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
ryder trs was acquired in and bracc was acquired in capital expenditures  largely for new rental locations  improvement in service levels and to upgrade computer hardware and software were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for decreased to million during from million during  primarily due to increased utilization of restricted cash to fund vehicle purchases and a lower level of vehicle related financing activity 
net cash provided by financing activities during increased from million in  due primarily to the proceeds received from the issuance of mtns and the trust preferred securities  which was partially offset by the utilization of these proceeds to repay existing vehicle and non vehicle debt of budget group and ryder trs 
debt facilities general we borrow money directly and through our special purpose fleet financing subsidiaries  team fleet financing corporation tffc and budget fleet financing corporation bffc 
subsidiaries also have various working capital facilities in place to finance operating activities 
at december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding   million of which represented secured fleet financing and million of which represented non vehicle indebtedness 
at december   we had million of availability under various fleet financing facilities 
recent debt placements and retirements in april  the company issued unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million bearing interest at due in the senior notes 
the net proceeds from this transaction were primarily used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under maturing medium term notes used to finance revenue earning vehicles and certain other secured indebtedness 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants which  among other things  restrict the company from incurring certain additional indebtedness  paying dividends or redeeming or repurchasing its capital stock  consolidating  merging or transferring assets and engaging in sale leaseback transactions 
in june  the company exchanged all of the unregistered initial senior notes for registered senior notes with identical terms 
in june  the company issued mtn notes with a principal amount of million bearing interest at rates ranging from to at december  tffc notes 
these notes have maturity dates from to both the notes issued in august tffc notes and the notes assumed in the bracc acquisition bffc a notes were repaid in full in these maturities were funded from the senior notes and the tffc notes 
see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
fleet financing facilities at december   the company had borrowed  million under asset backed mtn s and million under a commercial paper cp facility collectively fleet notes 
the mtn s are comprised of notes issued in december tffc notes  notes issued in april tffc notes  notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of ryder trs tffc notes and tffc notes issued in june the fleet notes are utilized largely to finance vehicles eligible for certain manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs and other allowable cars and trucks 
proceeds from the fleet notes that are temporarily unutilized for vehicle financing are maintained in restricted cash accounts with the trustees 
the fleet notes are collateralized by the secured vehicles  manufacturer receivables and the restricted cash accounts 
interest rates on the fleet notes at december   range from to 
in addition  we entered into a seasonal funding facility in the first quarter of that expires on june  at march  we had million outstanding under this facility 
our other vehicle obligations consist of outstanding lines of credit to purchase rental fleet 
borrowings under collateralized available lines of credit at december  consist of million with maturity dates through vehicle obligations are collateralized by revenue earning vehicles financed under these credit facilities and proceeds from the sale  lease or rental of rental vehicles 
interest payments for rental fleet facilities are due monthly at annual interest rates that range from to at december  management expects that vehicle obligations will generally be repaid within one year from the balance sheet date with proceeds received from either the repurchase of the vehicles by the manufacturers in accordance with the terms of the manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs or from the sales of the vehicles 
medium term notes in june  the company issued the tffc notes  which consist of an aggregate principal balance of million and bear interest at rates ranging from to at december  the proceeds were primarily used to repay the outstanding indebtedness under maturing medium term notes 
these notes have maturity dates from to interest on the tffc notes is payable monthly 
the  million tffc notes were entered into concurrently with the acquisition of ryder trs  require monthly interest payments and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to and have maturity dates from to proceeds from the notes were used to refinance ryder trs s commercial paper and to finance certain bracc vehicles 
the million tffc notes and cp facility were entered into concurrently with the bracc acquisition 
as of december   the cp has various interest rates  which ranged between and 
the tffc note facility requires monthly interest payments at an annual rate ranging from to 
the tffc notes are payable in the tffc notes total million with interest rates ranging from to at december  the tffc notes are payable beginning in may with the last payment due in trust preferred securities in june  the company issued million of trust preferred securities and received approximately million in net proceeds 
these funds were used to redeem the guaranteed senior notes and to partially fund the redemption of ryder trs s senior subordinated notes which occurred in july the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon the redemption of the underlying debentures due on june  the company has the right to defer interest payments due on the subordinated debentures for up to consecutive quarters which will also cause a deferral of distributions under the trust preferred securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital facility concurrent with the acquisition of ryder trs  the company entered into an amended and restated secured credit facility to increase its size from million to million 
this facility requires monthly interest payments on the outstanding balance at a rate based on libor plus or prime plus or at december  and expires in the facility is secured primarily by cash  accounts receivable and vehicles and is subject to certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum tangible net worth and restrict the payment of cash dividends 
at december   the company had million in letters of credit and no debt outstanding under this facility 
the credit facility was amended in the first quarter of to  among other things  modify certain financial covenants and permit the issuance of additional unsecured term notes to fund the maturities of mtn s 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants at december  change in financial condition total assets increased million to  million at december   from  million at december  this increase was largely in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  due to the development of new software  intangibles of million  primarily due to final purchase price allocations for ryder trs  and an increase in the net assets of discontinued operations of million due to opening of additional car sales locations early in the year  offset by a decrease in cash of million 
restricted cash decreased million to fund the increase in vehicles of million 
property and equipment net  increased by million due to investments in vehicle rental and sales locations 
total liabilities increased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  this increase was due to an increase in notes payable of million and accounts payable and accrued expenses of million partially offset by a decrease in a reduction in the company s deferred tax liability 
the increase in notes payable reflects the issuance of the million senior notes and the million tffc notes which was partially offset by the maturities of debt previously mentioned and a decline in outstanding cp 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting our operations 
many of our other operating expenses are inflation sensitive with increases in inflation generally resulting in increased costs of operations 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on our overall operating costs is not expected to be greater for us than for its competitors 
seasonality generally  in the vehicle rental industry  revenues increase in the spring and summer months due to the overall increase in business and leisure travel during this season 
we increase the size of our fleet and workforce in the spring and summer to accommodate increased rental activity during these periods and decrease our fleet and workforce in the fall and winter 
however  many of our operating expenses such as rent  insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during the fall and winter 
as a result of these patterns  for vehicle rental  the first quarter of each year is typically the weakest and the third quarter is typically the strongest 
due to recent  and planned future  expansion of corporate owned rental operations in europe  we expect that seasonal fluctuations in operating results will become more pronounced 
year issue the company had assessed the impact of the year yk on its reporting systems and operations the yk issue and completed all major modifications by the end of the yk issue existed because many computer systems and applications used two digit date fields to designate a year 
as of march  the company has not encountered any yk problems that have adversely affected operations internally or with suppliers or vendors 
all necessary changes identified during the date conversion period were completed on time and successfully with only minor issues in non critical applications that had to be addressed after january  we do not expect any further significant impact related to the yk issue 
the total cost to the company of the yk effort over the three year period to identify and correct applications was approximately million 
yk modifications costs were million in  million in and million in and charged to selling  general and administrative expenses in each of these periods 
environmental matters we have assessed and continue to assess the impact of environmental remediation efforts on our operations 
our exposure largely relates to the clean up and replacement of underground gasoline storage tanks 
during  we recognized approximately million in expenses related to remediation efforts and estimate that an aggregate of approximately million will be incurred in and based on past experience  we expect these estimates will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements 
however  due to factors such as continuing changes in the environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and changes in the extent of expected remediation efforts  estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainty and it is difficult to predict the amount or timing of future remediation requirements 
risk factors we had a net loss for we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of million for this net loss included one time  non recurring and other charges of million 
the full year effect of the net loss from discontinued operations was million in we have experienced net losses in the first quarters of the past two years  primarily as a result of seasonal factors  and anticipate that we will have a net loss for the quarter ending march  we cannot assure you that our losses will not continue in the future 
our business is highly seasonal our business is highly seasonal  particularly the leisure travel and consumer truck rental segments  and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
historically  revenues have been stronger in the third quarter due to the overall increase in business and leisure travel during the peak summer travel months and the increase in moving activity during this period 
the first quarter is generally weakest  when there is limited leisure travel and a greater potential for adverse weather conditions 
the third quarter accounted for of total revenue and of operating income for and of total revenue and of operating income for any occurrence that disrupts travel patterns during the summer  or any adverse competitive conditions during this period  may materially adversely impact our annual operating performance 
our business practice is to increase the size of our vehicle fleet and workforce during the spring and summer months to accommodate increased activity during these periods and to decrease our fleet and workforce in the fall and winter months 
however  many of our operating expenses such as rent  insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during the fall and winter months when there is decreased rental demand 
if we are unable to manage successfully the size of our vehicle fleet and workforce during periods of decreased business activity  our annual operating performance may be materially adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive there is intense competition in the vehicle rental industry particularly with respect to price and service 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with either existing or new competitors 
in any geographic market  we may encounter competition from national  regional and local vehicle rental companies 
our main competitors in the car rental market are alamo  avis  dollar  enterprise  hertz and national 
in our truck rental business  we face competition primarily from penske and u haul 
many of our competitors have larger rental volumes  greater financial resources and a more stable customer base than we have 
in the past  we have had to lower our rental prices in response to industry wide price cutting and have been unable to unilaterally raise our prices 
moreover  when the car rental industry has experienced vehicle oversupply competitive pressure has intensified 
we may not successfully integrate our operations in  we integrated the operations of our premier car rental subsidiary with the bracc car rental operations 
we also devoted significant resources to the consolidation and integration of our budget truck rental business with ryder trs and the vertical integration of our truck rental group with our north american vehicle rental operations  these efforts will continue in completing the integration of these businesses and achieving the anticipated levels of cost savings involves a number of risks that could affect our operating results 
integrating these operations has required significant capital investments 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully realize the benefits that we anticipated from the consolidation or our car and truck rental operations  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we experienced a significant charge for non recurring items in connection with certain restructuring and other initiatives  we announced that we would take non recurring and other one time charges of million in the fourth quarter of we are continuing our examination of our systems and business processes and cannot assure you that we will not need to take additional restructuring  one time charges and adjustments in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the benefits that we anticipated from initiatives related to our business operations 
we may not successfully implement our car sales exit strategies we plan to exit the car sales business by selling certain car sales locations and franchising additional locations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement this exit strategy in a timely manner  which could have a significant negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
we may not successfully dispose of our non core businesses we plan to sell our non core assets  including vpsi and cruise america  and assets associated with our car sales business 
we cannot assure you that we will complete these divestitures in a timely manner or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from disposing of these non core assets  which could have a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
our obligation to deliver a make whole payment may adversely affect future performance in connection with the ryder trs acquisition  we made cash make whole payments of million in july and expect to pay up to million or issue approximately  shares or a combination of cash and shares in in march  we repurchased warrants to purchase shares of our common stock from the former ryder trs shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
these payments diverted cash from other business purposes  which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
we are dependent on third parties for financing we depend on third party financing to fund our purchases of fleet vehicles 
accordingly  the availability of financing on favorable terms is critical to our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
a majority of our debt is incurred in connection with manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs 
as a result  significant changes in the credit programs of the vehicle manufacturers  particularly ford motor company  could significantly affect our ability to obtain this financing on favorable terms 
in addition  certain events  such as significant increases in the damage to vehicles  could reduce the value of the collateral securing our vehicle financing facilities and cause the acceleration of the repayment of such debt 
our inability to obtain vehicle financing on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that the sources of financing used in the past will remain or that alternative financing will become available on terms acceptable to us 
we are dependent on a principal supplier ford motor company has been and continues to be our principal supplier of vehicles 
under the terms of our supply agreement with ford  we have agreed that in the united states  canada  and other countries outside the european union our leases and purchases of ford vehicles will represent at least of the total new vehicle acquisitions by us  with a minimum purchase requirement of at least  vehicles in the united states in each model year 
shifting significant portions of our fleet purchases to other manufacturers would require significant advance notice and operational changes 
also  there can be no assurance that vehicles would be available from other suppliers on competitive terms  if at all 
as a result  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if ford is unable to supply our vehicles or if there is any significant decline in the quality and customer satisfaction with ford vehicles 
changes in manufacturers repurchase programs may affect our business our ability to resell our vehicles at a favorable price and fix our depreciation expense in advance is dependent upon the terms of manufacturers repurchase programs 
as of december   of bracc s car fleet was covered by these programs 
our ability to sell vehicles under manufacturers repurchase programs limits the risk of decline in residual value at the time of disposition and enables us to fix a substantial portion of our depreciation expense in advance 
vehicle depreciation is the largest expense in our vehicle rental operations 
in the past  automobile manufacturers have changed the terms of these programs by  among other things  reducing the number of vehicles that can be sold under their repurchase programs  reducing related incentives  increasing guaranteed depreciation and reducing the mileage allowed on program vehicles 
we could be adversely affected if our vehicle suppliers make these or other adverse changes in their repurchase programs 
we may be adversely impacted as a result of litigation with our former german franchisee in october  we discontinued providing services to our german franchisee such as reservations and credit card processing services  after having previously terminated the related franchise agreements for alleged contract violations 
this franchise termination is being contested by the franchisee in the german courts and a ruling is expected by the end of the second quarter of as a result of this development  we have experienced an adverse effect on our business in  and originating from  germany  and this adverse effect may continue 
we intend to replace the current franchisee with new franchisees and or corporate owned locations 
however  there is no assurance that such replacement will be commercially successful 
our operations and financial performance are affected by various types of regulations we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that affect the conduct of our operations 
these laws and regulations cover matters such as the sale of loss damage waivers  vicarious liability of vehicle owners  consumer protection  advertising  used vehicle sales  the taxing and licensing of vehicles  franchising operations and sales  and environmental compliance and clean up  particularly with regard to our substantial on site use and storage of petroleum products 
we cannot assure you that compliance with these laws and regulations or the adoption of modified or additional laws and regulations will not require large expenditures by us or otherwise have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations may be subject to additional risks we have committed significant resources in an effort to expand our international operations  particularly in europe 
a new rental counter system and back office system was developed and was or will be implemented in each of our owned locations 
our international operations are subject to adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment  varying governmental regulations  foreign currency fluctuations  potential difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potential adverse tax consequences 
we cannot assure you that these factors or an inability to achieve expected benefits from information systems and acquisitions will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our recent investments and cost cutting initiatives may not be successful during and  we expended significant capital resources on several initiatives designed to increase our revenue and reduce our costs  and these initiatives will continue during we expect to realize certain cost savings and other operating efficiencies during as a result of these and other initiatives that will be implemented in major areas in which we will seek to reduce our operating expenses include i reductions in administrative  personnel and overhead expenses  ii improvements in operations and consolidations of our reservations centers  iii improvements in vehicle maintenance procedures  iv increased efficiencies in non vehicle purchasing  and v reduction of vehicle carrying costs through changes in vehicle mix 
our ability to achieve the cost savings mentioned above is inherently uncertain 
we may not be able to successfully implement these initiatives  cost increases in other areas may offset the effect of these measures  implementation of these measures may initially lead to additional costs  and events beyond our control may cause us to otherwise fail to succeed in our cost cutting plans 
in addition  it is always possible that the implementation of our cost cutting initiatives could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful at growing our business or realizing the cost savings that these initiatives were intended to achieve 
our founders have substantial stockholder voting power a large portion of the voting power of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of three individuals  sanford miller  john p 
kennedy and jeffrey d 
congdon 
these individuals own all outstanding shares of class b common stock 
each share of class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share  while our class a common stock entitles holders to one vote per share 
the class b common stock beneficially owned by messrs 
miller  kennedy and congdon  together with the class a common stock owned by these individuals  represents approximately of the combined voting power of both classes of common stock 
as a result  these three individuals are able to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors along with other matters put to a stockholder vote 
this increases the probability that members elected by them will continue to direct our business  policies  and management 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness we maintain a substantial amount of secured indebtedness to finance our fleet purchases 
at december   we had billion of total outstanding indebtedness  of which billion was secured 
we had million of unsecured indebtedness at december   and stockholders equity of million at that date 
notwithstanding our capacity to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness  our substantial indebtedness could have negative consequences for our business  including the following a limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  b limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to debt service  c limiting our flexibility in reacting to changes in our industry and changes in market conditions  d increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business  and e increasing our interest expense due to increases in prevailing interest rates  because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient earnings or to borrow sufficient funds to cover our debt service obligations 
if for any reason we are in default under the terms of our indebtedness  the holders of our indebtedness will be able to declare all this indebtedness immediately due and payable and terminate their commitments  if any  with respect to additional funding obligations 
such holders could also proceed against their collateral  which  in the case of the vehicle financing facilities  consists of substantially all our fleet vehicles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of our revenue is generated outside the us the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries where we do business would not be material 
we do not typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not significant 
interest rate risk our outstanding debt consists of vehicle debt  revolving credit facilities  convertible subordinated debt and other debt which subjects us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had fixed rate debt totalling billion or of total outstanding debt 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
our floating rate debt was million or of total outstanding debt at december  a fluctuation of the interest rate by basis points would change our interest expense by million
