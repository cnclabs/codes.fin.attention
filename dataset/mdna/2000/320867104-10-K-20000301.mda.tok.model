item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is intended to address the significant factors affecting first midwest s consolidated income statements for the years through and statements of condition as of december  and the discussion is designed to provide stockholders with a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from a review of the consolidated financial statements alone and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information presented in this form k 
a condensed review of operations for the fourth quarter of is included beginning on page the review provides an analysis of the quarterly earnings performance for the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in all common stock and per share data have been adjusted to reflect the for stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend which was paid in december all dollar amounts are presented in thousands  except per share data 
unless otherwise stated  all earnings per share data included in this section and through the remainder of this discussion are presented on a diluted basis 
mergers heritage financial services  inc heritage on july   first midwest consummated the merger with heritage in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
heritage  headquartered in suburban chicago  was a multi bank holding company whose subsidiaries included a branch commercial bank  a trust company and a subsidiary that offered trust services and operated an insurance agency business 
heritage had total assets and stockholders equity of approximately billion and million  respectively  as of july  each outstanding share of heritage common stock  no par value  was converted into 
shares of first midwest common stock  
par value  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of first midwest common stock 
first midwest merged heritage s commercial bank and trust company  into first midwest bank  national association and first midwest trust company  respectively  in the fourth quarter the remaining subsidiary  heritage bank  national association  continues to offer trust services to customers of first midwest  the insurance agency business formerly operated by this subsidiary was transferred to first midwest bank  national association in connection with the commercial bank merger 
in connection with the merger  first midwest recognized  in the third quarter of  a pretax merger related charge totalling  consisting of  in customary acquisition related costs and expenses and in provision for loan losses incident to conforming the commercial bank s credit policies to first midwest s 
further information regarding the transaction is included under item of this form k starting on page and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page sparbank  incorporated sparbank on october   first midwest consummated the merger with sparbank  the holding company of mchenry state bank msb  a million commercial bank  located in mchenry  illinois 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests with an exchange of common stock resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of first midwest common stock to sparbank shareholders 
in connection with the merger  first midwest recorded a merger related charge in the amount  or 
per share relating to the acquisition consisting of  in acquisition related costs and expenses and in provision for loan losses incident to conforming msb s credit policies to first midwest s 
on february   msb was merged into first midwest bank  national association

the improvement in both nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets is attributable to the tightened underwirting standards and nonperforming loan outplacement policy that were implemented by first midwest in although these credit controls were partially responsible for the decrease in loans outstanding from year end to  they have contributed to the improved credit quality that first midwest has achieved while resuming growth in loans at an rate in capital and dividends first midwest s capital structure continued to be strong at december   with tier and total capital to risk based assets of and  respectively 
the capital levels of first midwest are in excess of those designated as well capitalized by the fdic improvement act with such levels having been maintained consistently as of each quarter end since inception of the capital ratios required by the fdic improvement act beginning in the company s capital position and earnings have allowed it to increase its dividend in  for the seventh straight year  to an indicated annual rate of

changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  respectively  on those assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis for certain tax exempt loans and securities

interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased in by  or  from and reversed a decrease in of  or  from net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis in was as compared to in and in the improvement in both net interest income and net interest margin in is due primarily to a reduction in interest expense on interest bearing deposits 
in response to a general drop in interest rates in the markets it serves  first midwest decreased deposit rates during the fourth quarter of and again during the mid first quarter of the result was a decrease of basis points on interest paid on total interest bearing liabilities from in to in although the general drop in interest rates likewise reduced the interest earned on interest earning assets  that decrease of basis points from in to in was offset by an increase in the volume of average earning assets 
the resulting improvement in net interest income and net interest margin reversed a decline experienced in as compared to that was primarily due to a lower level of high yielding loans and a reduction in the overall yield of the securities available for sale portfolio relating primarily to collateralized mortgage obligations 
contributing to the increase in earning assets in was the investment by first midwest in a leveraged arbitraged transaction 
during the third and fourth quarters of  first midwest purchased approximately million in us agency securities and financed such purchases with repurchase agreements 
as part of the overall transaction  first midwest also entered into interest rate swaps to fix the financing costs  resulting in a one year matched arbitrage with a locked interest rate spread of approximately basis points 
the leveraged arbitrage transaction accounts for most of the increase in the securities available for sale and short term borrowings average balances and the relating increases in interest income and interest expense  respectively  thereon 
additionally  since this transaction resulted in a higher level of interest earning assets at the narrow interest rate spread discussed above  it negatively impacted net interest margin for by approximately basis points 
first midwest had no leveraged arbitrage transactions of this type in place during or the following sections entitled rate sensitivity management and funding and liquidity management describe the techniques used by first midwest in managing the volatility and other factors affecting net interest income and net interest margin 
rate sensitivity management first midwest s earning assets and funding sources do not respond uniformly to changing market interest rates because of the differing interest rate  repricing and maturity characteristics of the various balance sheet categories of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the degree to which these market interest rate fluctuations can affect net interest income 
while there are several ways in which to analyze interest rate risk  the traditional method is called gap analysis 
gap analysis is a static management tool used to identify mismatches or gaps in the repricing of assets and liabilities within specified periods of time 
first midwest s gap analysis as of december  is presented in table earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are presented within selected time intervals over a one year forward period based upon their repricing and maturity characteristics 
in a perfectly matched gap analysis  an equal amount of rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be reflected as repricing within each given time interval 
a positive interest rate sensitivity gap indicates more assets than liabilities will reprice in that time period  while a negative gap indicates more liabilities will reprice 
table analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  days days days days rate sensitive assets rsa     rate sensitive liabilities rsl     interest sensitivity gap gap rsa less rsl incremental     cumulative     cumulative  excluding savings  money markets  and now accounts     rsa rsl ratio gap total assets cumulative gap total assets cumulative  excluding savings  money markets and now accounts the preceding table reflects a cumulative liability sensitive balance sheet over a one year time frame which likely will more positively affect net interest income if interest rates fall than if they rise 
however  while the gap analysis is widely used in the industry  it is unable to capture other factors affecting the sensitivity of the balance sheet  such as the time lags required for certain assets and liabilities to reprice because of their varying sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
for these reasons  a static gap analysis has limitations in its usefulness and its ability to effectively present the rate sensitivity of a balance sheet 
accordingly  first midwest uses a more dynamic approach to measuring interest rate risk by conducting simulations that demonstrate the changes that would occur in net interest income under different interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this form of modeling is conducted monthly  involves adjustments to balance sheet volumes over a month forward period  incorporates a repricing analysis of earning assets and funding sources and considers certain other off balance sheet hedging vehicles such as interest rate exchange agreements swaps  as further described below 
furthermore  first midwest has generally followed a policy of maintaining a balanced mix of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  making each side of the balance sheet approximately equally flexible in reacting to changes in market interest rates so that net interest income will not be adversely affected by more than  regardless of whether interest rates rise or fall rapidly 
the simulations described above  coupled with policy guidelines intended to limit the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates  provide guidance to first midwest in adjusting its strategies based on projections of the future interest rate environment to ensure maximization of net interest income 
the net interest income simulation model used by first midwest to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over a month horizon utilizes multiple rate scenarios 
these scenarios include a flat rate environment  a most likely forecast which first midwest believes is the most probable outlook  a gradual increase and decrease of at least basis points  and an immediate increase and decrease of basis points 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of derivative and other financial instruments  changes in loan and deposit volumes and pricing  deposit interest rate sensitivity and first midwest s capital plans 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in interest rate market conditions and strategies  among other factors 
furthermore  first midwest also believes that immediate and sustained changes in interest rates will not necessarily impact all interest bearing liabilities in the same fashion 
as discussed above  an immediate increase or decrease in first midwest s base lending rate may not result in an immediate  identical increase in rates paid on non maturing  non indexed interest bearing liabilities such as savings accounts  money markets and now accounts 
accordingly  first midwest analyzes the impact of immediate and sustained parallel changes in interest rates both including and excluding non maturing  non indexed deposits 
based on the results of its simulation model and the assumptions included therein  as of december   exclusive of the effect of the rate increase on non maturing  non indexed deposits  first midwest would expect a decrease in net interest income of and an increase in net interest income of if interest rates experienced an immediate increase or decrease  respectively  by basis points over a month period 
as of december   first midwest had expected a decrease in net interest income of and an increase in net interest income of for these same scenarios 
if non maturing  non indexed deposits were included in this analysis and were immediately affected by such increase or decrease in interest rates  the reduction in net interest income from a rise in rates of basis points would be while an improvement in net interest income of would result from a reduction in interest rates of basis points at december  at december   the reduction in net interest income from a rise in rates of basis points would have been  while an improvement in net interest income of would have resulted from a reduction in interest rates of basis points 
first midwest believes that its interest rate sensitivity position is appropriate given the current economic and interest rate environment 
as a part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  first midwest has entered into interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit variations in net interest income 
the advantages of using interest rate swaps include the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  enhance net interest margin and to customize the interest rate swap agreement to meet desired risk parameters 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
the net cash flow paid or received by first midwest on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to the interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
the primary risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  or the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on the interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to first midwest by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
first midwest controls this credit risk by maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  first midwest s interest rate swap transactions generally require the establishment of a mutual mark to market arrangement whereby cash collateral may be required to be on deposit with first midwest and or the counterparty 
as of december   first midwest had total interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  in place  hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of these swaps as well as the fair value are detailed in note to notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page first midwest does not act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal and loan demand needs 
first midwest s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the board of directors 
while asset liquidity provides funds through the maturity and sale of loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  another source of liquidity is liability liquidity  consisting primarily of interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits as well as repurchase agreements 
other liability funding sources potentially include funds purchased facilities available thorough certain correspondent banks and funding through the discount window borrowing facilities of the federal reserve system 
table provides a year to year comparison of the sources of first midwest s liability funding based upon average balances over the last three years 
average  rather than period end  balances are more meaningful in analyzing first midwest s funding sources because of the inherent fluctuations that occur on a monthly basis within most deposit categories 
table funding sources average balances of of of total total total demand deposits    savings deposits    now accounts    money market accounts    time deposits in denominations of or less    core deposits    time deposits in denominations of or more    repurchase agreements    funds purchased and other borrowed funds    total funding sources    the increase in average core deposits in as compared to resulted from a combination of product introductions coupled with a new advertising campaign and the use of multi media advertising  primarily in the chicago suburban markets 
the drop in core deposits in resulted  in part  from the decrease in interest rates paid as discussed in the net interest income section located on page of the million increase in non core funding sources in  approximately is attributable to the short term leveraged arbitrage transaction discussed in the net interest income section 
tables and that follow provide additional information regarding first midwest s wholesale deposit and short term funding activities table maturities of time deposits of or more as of december  maturing within months  after but within months  after but within months  after months  total  table borrowed funds amount rate amount rate amount rate at year end securities sold under agreements to repurchase    federal funds purchased   federal home loan bank advances    other borrowed funds   total borrowed funds    average for the year securities sold under agreements to repurchase    federal funds purchased    federal home loan bank advances    other borrowed funds    total borrowed funds    maximum month end balance securities sold under agreements to repurchase    federal funds purchased    federal home loan bank advances    other borrowed funds    historically  first midwest has made extensive use of repurchase agreements as a deposit surrogate because this funding source is not subject to the reserve requirements applicable to interest bearing deposits and has also realized direct cost savings in prior years because fdic insurance premiums were not assessed on these funding sources 
during  first midwest reduced its reliance on repurchase agreements as a funding source because the cost of these funds became more expensive relative to both core deposit funding and other short term borrowing sources 
as a result  first midwest placed a greater reliance on funds purchased and fhlb advances 
as interest rates dropped in and early  first midwest once again emphasized the use of repurchase agreements as a funding source 
additionally  repurchase agreements were also used in to fund the short term leveraged arbitrage transaction previously discussed 
the liquidity needs of first midwest parent company consist primarily of operating expenses and dividend payments to first midwest s stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from affiliates 
however  this source can also be supplemented by fees assessed to affiliates  a practice which has not been utilized in recent years 
the parent company has short term credit facilities which require no compensating balances available to fund cash flow needs totaling  at december  the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had  of debt outstanding under its short term credit facilities as of year end analysis of noninterest income and expense noninterest income noninterest income  exclusive of net security gains  increased by and in and  respectively  reflecting improvements in all categories except mortgage banking revenues 
the following table analyzes the components of noninterest income  excluding net security gains  for the years through table analysis of noninterest income change service charges on deposit accounts    trust and investment management fees    other service charges  commissions and fees    mortgage banking revenues    corporate owned life insurance   n m other income    total noninterest income    for a discussion of security gains  refer to the investment management section located on page n m not a meaningful ratio 
service charges on deposit accounts  the largest component of noninterest income  consists of fees on both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts as well as charges for items such as nonsufficient funds nsf fees  overdrafts and stop payment requests 
service charges on deposit accounts include both hard dollar charges and charges assessed through account analysis  the latter being reduced by earnings credits indexed to a short term us treasury yield and generally applicable to business deposit accounts 
the increase of  or  in and  or  in were due to higher volumes of business checking accounts and the resulting higher service charges  as well as increased nsf fees 
also contributing to the increase in was a comprehensive review of nsf fee waiver practices which resulted in higher collection rates in this fee category 
the trust company provides trust and investment management services to its customers  acting as executor  administrator  trustee  agent  and in various other fiduciary capacities for client accounts 
trust and investment management fees generally follow the amount of total assets under management as well as conditions in the equity and credit markets because fees are often assessed on the market value of managed funds 
assets under management totaled billion at december  this category of noninterest income increased by in and in the increase in was broad based and effected all types of trust accounts with the largest portions of the increase being realized in the personal trust and employee benefit categories 
the increase in other service charges  commissions and fees  which totaled in and in  primarily relates to debit card fee income  check printing fees and commissions earned on official check outsourcing for both years 
in  first midwest purchased certain life insurance policies with seven national insurance carriers all of whom were rated in the top ranking levels by the insurance carrier rating agencies 
the policies  on which first midwest is the beneficiary  insure the lives of certain key first midwest executives and were purchased with the proceeds of securities sales from the available for sale portfolio 
corporate owned life insurance income represents the cash buildup from the life insurance policies 
the cash buildup is afforded tax favored treatment and serves as a proxy for tax exempt income 
the tax equivalent yield on the corporate owned life insurance policies  which totaled  at december  and  at december   was and  respectively 
other income increased by in over  following a increase in over the increase in both years was primarily attributable to both higher volumes of automatic teller machine atm activity as well as a general increase in fee schedules for atm s 
first midwest conducts its residential real estate mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing operations through fmmc 
mortgage banking revenues from these operations include commissions and fees from third party loan servicing  realized gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market and origination and other fees received at closing 
the following tables through summarize mortgage loan origination  sales and servicing activities for the years through as well as the mortgage banking revenues that have resulted from these activities table residential real estate originations and sales residential real estate mortgage loans originated    sold to third parties    table mortgage loan servicing portfolio residential real estate mortgage loans serviced for third parties    serviced for first midwest s portfolio    total loans serviced    table mortgage banking revenues loan production income    servicing fee income    less amortization of mortgage servicing rights    gains on sales of mortgage loans    gains on sales of mortgage servicing rights total mortgage banking revenues    the decrease in mortgage banking revenues in as compared to resulted primarily from the effect of general market interest rates on mortgage refinancings in both years 
as interest rates fell in through early  the refinancing market was exceptionally strong as indicated by the real estate mortgage loans originated in table above 
as market interest rates began to trend higher in latter  the volume of loans originated declined  likewise reducing loan production income 
furthermore  the turn in market rates in was accompanied by a higher than normal degree of rate volatility  negatively impacting gains on the sale of mortgage loans 
as mortgages are refinanced  the mortgage servicing rights related to such mortgages likewise must be written down in full 
it has been first midwest s policy to use financial derivatives to hedge interest rate risk associated with mortgage servicing rights to minimize the impairment of such servicing rights resulting from a drop in interest rates and the attendant increase in mortgage refinancings 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page describes first midwest s hedging policy and the financial derivatives involved 
during late fourth quarter  first midwest commenced a strategic review of the manner in which it delivers mortgage products to its customers 
the primary purposes of the strategic review are to ensure satisfaction of customer needs through the appropriate delivery of this product  while enhancing revenue predictability from this product line that is effected by the volatility in market interest rates 
first midwest expects to conclude its review and implement any changes in mortgage banking operations during the first quarter of noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled  in as compared to  in and  in noninterest expense in and included certain special items relating to merger expenses 
the following table analyses the major components of noninterest expense for the years through and provides further detail related to the special items table analysis of noninterest expense change compensation expense    occupancy expense    equipment expense    computer processing expense    professional services    advertising and promotions    other expenses    subtotal    special items merger expense   n m n m total noninterest expense    efficiency ratio excludes special charges in and n m not a meaningful ratio 
compensation expense  the largest component of noninterest expense  includes employee salaries and wages  retirement and other employee benefits and expense relating to temporary personnel costs 
table analyzes the components of compensation expense for the years through table analysis of compensation expense change salaries and wages    retirement and other employee benefits    temporary personnel expense   total compensation expense    average full time equivalent fte employees    the modest increases in compensation expense over the period through are primarily attributable to two factors  i staff reductions due to merger related efficiencies applicable to both the sparbank acquisition in october and the heritage acquisition in july  and ii the restructuring of first midwest s retirement benefits effective january  that saw a restructuring of retirement benefits which had been found to be in excess of market levels 
the merger efficiencies realized in connection with the sparbank and heritage acquisitions have resulted in a reduction of average full time equivalent employees each year since first midwest has been able to maintain staffing efficiency by utilizing temporary personal to staff post merger integration activities and short term projects such as yk compliance  thereby containing growth in its fte compliment 
the restructuring of retirement benefits has contributed to the reduction in retirement and other employee benefits as a percentage of salary and wages for both and a discussion of first midwest s retirement benefits and the expenses related thereto is included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page occupancy expense increased by in over following a increase in over the increase is primarily attributable to the initiation of a program to outsource facilities management which began in this program resulted in increased occupancy costs through payments to a third party vendor but also reduced permanent fte levels 
in addition  first midwest operated overlapping heritage branches in and that were closed in the fourth quarter of computer processing expense increased by in over and followed a increase in over the increase in over is attributable to the costs associated with duplicate systems being operated through the completion of the sparbank operational merger in february and the heritage operational merger in october of that year 
saw computer processing costs returning to more normalized levels  as the benefits of the aforementioned operational mergers began to be realized 
the increase in professional services in over related to legal costs associated with the sale of certain residential mortgage loans in  with such sales resulting from the merger of the sparbank and heritage loan portfolios 
the increase in this category during was largely due to loan related costs associated with a third quarter home equity loan promotion  in addition to consultancy fees applicable to outsourcing participant recordkeeping services by the trust company 
advertising and promotions expense decreased by in following an increase of in the expense level was primarily a result of a new multi media advertising campaign targeting suburban metropolitan chicago 
additionally  in both and  additional advertising costs were incurred related to the sparbank and heritage mergers to ensure maximum customer retention 
advertising and promotional costs in returned to more normal levels 
other expenses increased by in as compared to after decreasing in as compared to other expenses include various categories such as freight courier costs  merchant credit card expense  supplies and printing  and miscellaneous losses and expenses 
the increase in is attributable to higher freight and express costs resulting from additional courier routes amongst the branches and operation centers  higher merchant credit card expense as well as costs applicable to review of certain branch operations that resulted in the closing of redundant heritage branches previously discussed 
additionally  included certain expense reimbursements credited to this category that were not duplicted in merger expenses related to both the sparbank and heritage mergers were recorded in and  respectively  and included customary investment banking and professional fees and anticipated severance and related benefits due to staff reductions 
a discussion of the mergers  including the special charges incurred  is included under the mergers section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located on page and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements located on page income taxes first midwest annually develops an income tax plan for the current year and updates its long term plan which addresses a three year tax planning horizon 
first midwest s goal in tax planning is the maximization of long term  after tax profitability on a consolidated basis and not necessarily a reduction in the absolute income tax expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
first midwest s provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income tax expense 
an analysis of the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rates for the periods through are detailed in table table analysis of income tax expense income before income tax expense    income tax expense    effective income tax rate certain of the acquisition related expenses recorded during and were not deductible for income tax purposes and affected the effective tax rates for both years 
factoring out the acquisition related charges for and  the effective tax in each period would have been and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for both and as compared to the prior years is due primarily to the addition of corporate owned life insurance income  planned increases in state tax exempt income and purchases of small issue qualified tax exempt municipal securities 
capital management and dividends a strong capital structure is crucial in maintaining investor confidence  accessing capital markets and enabling first midwest to take advantage of future profitable growth opportunities 
first midwest has developed a policy to manage its capital structure and that of its affiliates in accordance with regulatory guidelines and to ensure the appropriate use of this resource 
first midwest s capital policy requires that each affiliate maintain a capital ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory guidelines and also acts as an internal discipline in analyzing business risks and internal growth opportunities  in addition to setting targeted levels of return on equity 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  first midwest and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines require that first midwest and its banking subsidiaries meet specific guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital and assets  risk weightings and other factors 
quantative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require first midwest and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital to average assets as defined 
first midwest believes that  as of december   first midwest and first midwest bank  national association meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the office of the comptroller of the currency categorized first midwest bank  national association as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for the fdicia 
to be categorized as well capitalized

in  first midwest restructured its mortgaged backed securities portfolio through the purchase of a mixture of short term average life  high coupon collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s 
during  as a result of the general decline in market interest rates and the corresponding historically high mortgage prepayments that occurred as mortgage holders refinanced their debt  the cmo portfolio underperformed initial expectations causing the overall yield on the taxable available for sale portfolio to drop from on a tax equivalent basis in to in in order to limit the future potential negative impact on interest income as a result of the performance of the cmo portfolio  first midwest sold the poorest performing portion of the cmo portfolio and reinvested the proceeds in more stable  longer term cashflow mortgage backed securities  us agency securities and municipal securities 
during  first midwest continued to restructure its mortgage backed securities portfolio by continuing to liquidate its position in the high coupon cmo s and reinvesting the proceeds in us agency and municipal securities 
this portfolio restructuring  as well as the purchase of million in us agencies in connection with the leveraged arbitrage transaction previously discussed in the net interest income section located on page  resulted in the redistribution of the securities available for sale portfolio between year end and as shown in table  as of december  the pre tax unrealized loss in the securities available for sale portfolio representing the difference between the total portfolio amortized cost and market value at december  was  as compared to an unrealized pre tax gain of  at year end during the period between year end and  the interest rates on the and year us treasury bond rose approximately and basis points  respectively 
the decrease in the market value of the mortgaged backed securities portfolio results primarily from the general increase in mortgage rates during  partially offset by a reduction in mortgage loan prepayments 
the duration of the mortgage backed securities portfolio at year end was approximately years with a tax equivalent yield to maturity of 
similarly  the rise in interest rates also negatively affected the state and municipal securities portfolio which consists of longer term tax exempt securities

securities gains  net net gains decreased in to as compared to  in and  in loan portfolio and credit quality portfolio composition loans represent the principal source of revenue to first midwest because  as a category  they are both the largest component and the highest yielding asset on the statement of condition 
the corollary to generating higher yields  however  is the assumption of credit risk associated with the loan portfolio 
among the ways in which credit risk is controlled is through diversification of the loan portfolio and the limitation of the amount of loans extended to any one industry or group of borrowers 
over the past several years  first midwest has migrated toward a loan portfolio that it has attempted to distribute approximately evenly among the categories of commercial and industrial including agricultural  consumer including real estate family and real estate both commercial and construction 
this type of diversification spreads the risk and reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries 
it is first midwest s policy to concentrate its lending activities in the geographic market areas it serves  generally lending to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from whom deposits are gathered in the same market areas 
as a result  first midwest had no consequential out of market loans at december  first midwest does not engage in lending to foreign countries or foreign entities

as a result  loan growth was experienced across virtually all categories of the portfolio 
commercial and industrial loans are diversified from an industry standpoint and include loans to manufacturing  retailing and other service businesses 
consistent with first midwest s emphasis on relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers who also maintain deposit relationships and utilize other first midwest banking services such as cash management 
this category of lending was most acutely affected by the pricing and underwriting competitive conditions in and showed a nominal decrease in loans outstanding from year end levels 
notwithstanding the competitive circumstances  however  agricultural loans  which have the same general characteristics as commercial and industrial  grew by as a result of improvement in the agricultural markets in which first midwest operates 
consumer loans consist of loans made directly to individuals for various personal purposes  as well as indirect installment loans represented mainly by automobile financings acquired from dealerships in first midwest s primary markets 
this category also includes direct home equity loans and other direct installment loans 
the increase in this loan category in was experienced across all types of consumer loans  especially the home equity component  as first midwest conducted a very successful home equity promotional campaign 
real estate family loans are comprised predominately of owner occupied residential properties 
this loan category decreased by in primarily as a result of the general increase in market interest rates which resulted in an industry wide reduction in refinancings 
real estate commercial loans represent multi unit residential mortgages and commercial real estate mortgages  many housing the operations of the borrower s business 
during the first three quarters of  many first midwest commercial real estate borrowers were being attracted by long term low rate loans being offered through the secondary markets 
first midwest felt that loans on such terms were not appropriate for its portfolio and elected not to compete on those terms 
with the volatility in the bond and credit markets experienced during the early fourth quarter of this trend began to reverse and continued into  resulting in an increase in this loan category over year end levels 
real estate construction loans consist primarily of single family and multi family residential projects located in the primary markets of first midwest s banking offices 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for first midwest due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans 
real estate construction loans grew by in resulting from a heightened level of construction projects in the chicago suburban markets within which first midwest operates

first midwest has implemented a comprehensive credit administration policy and procedures which are monitored by an internal loan review staff 
this policy and procedures are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order to remain suitable for the management of risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
first midwest s credit administration policies include a loan rating system and an analysis by the internal loan review staff of all loans and commitments over a fixed limit  as well as statistical sampling of loans under such dollar limit 
furthermore  each account officer is vested with the responsibility of monitoring their respective loan customer relationships and acts as the first line of defense in determining changes in the loan ratings on credits for which they are responsible 
first midwest believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will first manifest itself in the migration of loan ratings within the monitoring system 
first midwest maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses is determined by systematically performing a review of the loan portfolio quality as required by the credit administration policy and procedures described above 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three elements  i reserves established for specific loans developed through detailed credit reviews  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience  and  iii reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the markets in which first midwest operates 
the specific reserves are based on the detailed analysis of loans over a specified dollar limit  as discussed above  as well as loans where the internal credit rating is below a predetermined classification 
specific reserves for commercial loans are based on an ongoing review of individual loans outstanding and binding commitments to lend  whereas consumer and retail loan reserve allocations are based upon the evaluation of pools or groups of such loans 
the portion of the reserve based on historical loan loss experience is determined statistically using a loss migration analysis that examines loss experience and the related internal rating of loans charged off 
the loss migration analysis is performed quarterly and loss factors are periodically updated based on actual experience 
the portion of the reserve based on general economic conditions and other factors is considered the unallocated portion of the reserve 
this portion considers general economic conditions and involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
this segment of the reserve considers risk factors that may not have not manifested themselves in first midwest s historical loss experience used to determine the allocated component of the reserve 
table shows the allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category as well as charge off and recovery information for the last years 
in  first midwest refined its allocation methodology to more closely align the projected losses in each category of the loan portfolio with the migration analysis and historical loan loss experience methodology discussed above 
accordingly  first midwest has allocated a larger portion of its reserve for loan losses in and than in prior years 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in any given year is dependent on factors including loan growth and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  net charge off levels and management s assessment of the reserve for loan losses based upon the credit administration policies and procedures discussed above 
the provision for loan losses totalled  the provision for loan losses of  includes representing a one time provision to conform heritage s credit policies to first midwest s

past due loans are loans which are delinquent days or more and are still accruing interest 
it is first midwest s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan when there is reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the financial position of the borrower and other relevant factors indicate there is no longer doubt as to such collectability

in from 
in the increase in nonaccrual loans in was primarily attributable to two commercial loan customers  each comprising approximately one half of the increase 
during  nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were comparable to levels but improved on a percentage basis 
first midwest s disclosure with respect to impaired loans is contained in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements located on page 
in addition to the loans summarized in table  the securities and exchange commission industry guide for bank holding companies requires that certain other loans which first midwest is monitoring  but where current conditions do not warrant classification as nonaccrual or restructured  be disclosed 
these loans  which totaled  at december   as compared to  at year end  continue to accrue interest and are specifically considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
year since april  first midwest has been engaged in the process of addressing a potential problem that confronted all users of automated information systems  including personal computers  generally referred to as the year issue 
the issue is the result of computer systems processing transactions based upon digits representing the year of the transaction rather than full digits ie for 
during  first midwest completed all renovations  testing and the development of detailed contingency plans to address potential risks in the event of year failures 
to date  first midwest experienced no significant problems relating to the century turn transition 
although considered unlikely  unanticipated problems in first midwest s core business processes  including problems associated with non compliant third parties and disruptions to the economy in general  could still occur despite efforts to date to remediate affected systems and develop contingency plans 
management will continue to monitor all business processes  including interaction with the company s customers  vendors and other third parties  throughout to address any issues and ensure all processes continue to function properly 
all costs incurred to address the year issue have had no material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
there are no anticipated material expenditures expected to be incurred in the future related to the year issue
