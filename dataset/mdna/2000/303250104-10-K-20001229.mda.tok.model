this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes 
in addition to historical information  this report includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future results 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those described in the risk factors section of this discussion and analysis 
results of operations revenues our business segments are o north american financial services 
the majority of our revenues are derived from our north american financial services unit  which primarily markets our alliance products and services and analytic products and services in the united states and canadian markets 
o netsourced services 
the netsourced services unit principally markets targeting and prospecting products  together with origination and underwriting  account and customer management products and standalone consulting services in the north american market 
o other international 
the other international business unit covers all of our operations outside of the united states and canadian markets 
comparative segment revenues  profits and related financial information for  and are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales to the consumer credit industry continue to account for the majority of our revenues 
credit scoring and credit account management services sold through credit bureaus and third party credit card processors are generally priced based on usage 
products developed specifically for a single user in this market are generally sold on a fixed price basis 
such products include application and behavior scoring models also known as analytic products  scorecards or models  credit application processing systems creditdesk and creditcenter and custom credit account management systems  including those marketed under the name triad 
software systems usually also have a component of ongoing maintenance revenue  and creditdesk systems have also been sold under time or volume based price arrangements 
products sold to the insurance industry are generally priced based on the number of policies in force  subject to contractual minimums 
targeting and prospecting products are sold under a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing 
the following table displays a the percentage of revenues by product category and b the percentage change in revenues within each product category from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenues percentage changes years ended september  to to alliance products and services targeting and prospecting analytic products and services origination and underwriting account and customer management standalone consulting other total revenues alliance products and services revenues are generated primarily by usage priced credit scoring services distributed through major credit bureaus and credit account management services distributed through third party bankcard processors in the united states and canada 
alliance products and services also include our scorenet and prescore services  insurance bureau scores  and other related products 
the growth in alliance products and services revenues in fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior fiscal periods were primarily due to a strong demand for risk scoring services at the credit bureaus  and increased revenues from services provided through bankcard processors and from our insurance bureau scores at the credit bureaus 
in fiscal  these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues derived from the scorenet services and in fiscal  were partially offset by decreased revenues derived from the scorenet and prescore service 
we believe that the decline in scorenet service revenues primarily reflects a shift in the purchasing patterns of our customers from these products to credit scoring service at the credit bureaus 
revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for most of our revenue growth in the last three years 
revenues from services produced through credit bureaus increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal  and accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal and in fiscal revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  primarily due to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
while we have been successful in extending or renewing our agreements with credit bureaus and credit card processors in the past  and believe we will likely be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a material adverse effect on revenues and operating margin 
in fiscal  trans union corporation accounted for approximately of our revenues  equifax  inc  approximately  and experian information solutions  inc  less than 
revenues generated through our alliances with equifax  experian and trans union each accounted for approximately to in fiscal and to of our revenues in fiscal targeting and prospecting services  comprised principally of the former dynamark business unit  include a variety of data processing  database management and internet delivery services provided to companies and organizations involved in direct marketing 
revenues from targeting and prospecting products are generated from a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing arrangements 
the increases in targeting and prospecting products revenues in fiscal and fiscal were due primarily to increased demand for services from customers in the financial services industry 
analytic products and services include all revenues from our custom models  custom software and related consulting projects used for screening lists of prospective customers  evaluating applicants for credit or insurance and managing existing credit accounts 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal primarily reflects the impact of bank consolidations and external marketing forces related to the year issue 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to our sales of new products and increased sales of small business loan scoring products 
origination and underwriting products automate the processing of credit applications and are primarily comprised of products that were formerly referred to as asap tm products 
revenues from origination and underwriting products increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due primarily to increased sales of creditdesk and sales of strategyware r decision engine systems 
in may we released a new line of products  liquidcredit  which provides real time credit decisioning over the internet 
we believe that the liquidcredit line of products will  over time  replace our creditdesk product offerings 
during the quarter ended september   we elected to adopt aicpa statement of position no 
sop though adoption by us was not required for periods prior to october  origination and underwriting revenues decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the deferral of revenues resulting from the adoption of sop if sop had not been adopted  origination and underwriting revenues would have decreased by in fiscal as a result of the early adoption of sop  software revenues of approximately million were deferred to fiscal if we had implemented sop as of october   there would have been approximately million less in origination and underwriting revenue for the year ended september   which would have been deferred to future periods 
account and customer management products include our revenues from sales of credit account management systems triad sold to end users  and our fraud control systems products 
the increases in revenues from fiscal to fiscal were primarily due to the release of triad in fiscal and increases from fiscal to fiscal were due primarily to continuing sales of triad with respect to triad  our high degree of success in penetrating the us bankcard industry with these products has limited  and may continue to limit  the revenue growth in that market 
however  we have added functionality for the existing base of triad users and are actively marketing triad for other types of credit products and in overseas markets 
standalone consulting services  composed principally of the services offered by our former credit and risk management associates subsidiary 
revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to redeployment of personnel to implement the company s new focus and initiatives after having increased in fiscal  compared to  due to increased sales of consulting services 
our revenues derived from clients outside the united states increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal increases in international revenues in fiscal were due primarily to sales of software products  including triad and creditdesk  increased usage of credit bureau scores and the number of accounts using our account management services at credit card processors in europe 
the decrease in international revenues in fiscal was principally the result of a decline in revenues from sales by our subsidiary  risk management technologies rmt  in the asian market 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not had a significant effect on revenues to date  but may become more important if  as expected  the proportion of our revenues denominated in foreign currencies increases in the future 
other products include our smaller  discrete product lines and revenues of rmt 
the revenues of rmt were down significantly in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to bank consolidations and delay in releases of new products and in fiscal from fiscal were due principally to our decision to cease marketing rmt s radar tm product line 
revenues from software maintenance and consulting services each accounted for less than of revenues in each of the three years in the period ended september   and we do not expect revenues from either of these sources to exceed of revenues in the foreseeable future 
over the long term  in addition to the factors discussed above  our rate of revenue growth excluding growth due to acquisitions is limited by the rate at which we can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
we believe this constraint will continue to exist indefinitely 
on the other hand  despite the high penetration we have already achieved in certain markets  the opportunities for application of our core competencies are much greater than we can pursue 
thus  we believe we can continue to grow revenues  within the personnel constraint  for the foreseeable future 
at times we may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities that we believe have exceptional long term potential 
this is the basis for our new strategic focus on becoming an e business company and implementing new growth initiatives targeted at the retail and telecommunications markets 
expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues research and development sales  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel directly involved in creating revenue  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and the amounts paid by us to credit bureaus for scores and related information in connection with the scorenet service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  increased in fiscal and fiscal over the prior year 
in fiscal the increase was primarily due to costs related to the discontinued healthcare receivables management system hrms line of business  the increasing revenues coming from targeting and prospecting products and services  all of which generally have a lower gross margin than our other products and services  and an increase in personnel costs because of a change in policy for accrued vacation and sick leave 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily due to the increasing percentage of revenues coming from targeting and prospecting products and services  which generally have a lower gross margin than our other products and services on average 
research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in new and existing product development  researching mathematical and statistical models and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity  profitability and management control 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior period  due primarily to redeployment of personnel to focus on increasing asp delivery capacity for new products 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to new products  product extensions and charges for a software development license 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to new fraud detection software products  the release of a new version of triad software  year compliance work  development of a new automated strategic application processing system for high end users  next generation credit bureau risk scores and healthcare receivables management 
in the last quarter of fiscal  we began work on a number of projects for clients in the e business and telecommunications industries 
the decrease in research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal was due to a reduction in costs of year compliance work and work related to product development for efunds formerly deluxe financial services  inc  and the replacement of relatively expensive consultants with salaried employees 
though individual offerings accounted for a decreasing percentage of revenues in fiscal and  we continue to invest in innovations in the context of current offerings for existing clients and developing and applying analytic and software technologies to create real time decision making solutions for internet applications 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to be a significant expense in future periods as new products targeted at the telecommunications and retail markets are developed and we continue to implement our strategy to become an e business company 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee salaries and benefits  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  expenses associated with the exploration of new business opportunities  the costs of operating administrative functions  such as finance and computer information systems and compensation expenses for certain senior management 
sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of revenues  were lower as compared with fiscal  due primarily to a reduction in consulting expenses 
in the prior fiscal year  we incurred consulting fees related to our northstar reorganization and incurred no such fees in the current fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were lower than in fiscal  due primarily to emphasis on cost reduction measures resulting in slower personnel growth and reassignment of personnel and related costs 
amortization of intangibles we are amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from four to fifteen years 
also see note and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal  we announced the discontinuance of our hrms line and recorded restructuring charges totaling  during the second quarter we announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions aimed at reducing costs and recognized a  charge for the estimated costs of those actions 
the restructuring action consisted of terminating approximately full time employees 
the combined restructuring actions have resulted in cash expenditures of  and a non cash asset write down of  through september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other income expense the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the detail of other income and expenses 
interest income is derived from the investment of funds surplus to our immediate operating requirements 
at september   we had approximately million invested in u s treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
interest income increased in both fiscal and due to higher average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and instruments 
in fiscal  we entered into a synthetic lease arrangement to construct an office complex intended to accommodate future growth 
on september   we sold our office complex project the lindaro project to a real estate development firm and have decided not to occupy any part of the project 
the transaction closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in a loss of approximately million as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we realized a one time gain of  due to curtailment of our pension plan  as described in note and to the consolidated financial statements  and realized a gain of  from the sale of marketable securities 
in fiscal  the difference between the increase in operating income of and the increase in net income of was primarily due to the interest income derived from investments in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments  and the absence of losses from equity investments in start ups 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase to in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the increased goodwill amortization in the current year resulting from the earnout paid to former stockholders of crma under the crma purchase agreement 
capital resources and liquidity working capital increased to  at september  from  at september  and  at september  the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  a higher proportion of investments in short term investments  a lower accrual for compensation and employee benefits expenses  and increases in accounts receivable and billings in excess of earned revenues 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  unbilled work in progress and decreases in other accrued liabilities  which more than offset the decreases in short term investments and accounts receivable and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits 
our exposure to collection risks is comprised of the sum of accounts receivable plus unbilled work in progress  less billings in excess of earned revenues 
changes in contract terms and product offerings  along with variations in timing  may cause fluctuations in any or all of these items 
during fiscal  accounts receivable decreased compared with fiscal due to improved collection efforts 
the increases in billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
the increase in unbilled work in progress was due primarily to the implementation of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop and sop during fiscal year ended compared with fiscal  during fiscal  increases in accounts receivables and increases in billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional  with minimal change in unbilled work in progress 
our primary method for funding operations and growth has been cash flows generated from operations and occasional lease financing 
cash flows from operating activities were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in net operating cash flows in fiscal decreased  compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in net income  non cash adjustment for deferred income tax  and net working capital changes  partially offset by increase in a non cash adjustments for depreciation 
net operating cash flows in fiscal increased  compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in net income and a non cash adjustment for depreciation  partially offset by a non cash adjustment for deferred income tax charge and net working capital increases 
investing activities consumed  in cash in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we primarily use cash for purchases of property and equipment and investment in marketable securities 
increase in spending during fiscal compared to was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment 
the decrease in spending during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in net investments in marketable securities  and a non recurring payment for acquisition of subsidiaries during financing activities provided  in cash in fiscal  compared to using cash of  in fiscal  and providing cash of  in fiscal our financing activities primarily consist of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of treasury stock  principal payments for capital lease obligations  and for dividends and repurchases of our stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and was primarily due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of treasury stock 
net cash used in financing during fiscal was primarily made for repurchases of our stock 
the lindaro project was closed out in the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in a loss of approximately million 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   we had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company initiated a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to purchase up to one million shares of its common stock  to be funded by cash on hand 
through september   the company had repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
we believe that the cash and marketable securities on hand  along with cash expected to be generated by operations  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs for both the current fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
european economic and monetary union emu under the european union s plan for economic and monetary union emu  the euro becomes the sole accounting currency of emu countries on january  its initial phase went into effect on january   in participating countries austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain 
in this initial phase the emu mandated that key financial systems be able to triangulate conversion rates so that any amount booked will be logged and processed simultaneously in both the local currency and euros 
we believe that our computer systems and programs are euro compliant 
costs associated with compliance were not material and were expensed by us as they were incurred 
we also believe the conversion to the euro will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
risk factors our revenues are dependent  to a great extent  upon general economic conditions and more particularly  upon conditions in the consumer credit and the financial services industries 
the majority of our revenues are derived from sales to the consumer credit industry 
in addition  during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from financial services related products 
a downturn in the consumer credit industry or the financial services industry caused by increases in interest rates or a tightening of credit  among other factors could harm our results of operations 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our existing and new products  particularly in the product segments in which we compete 
because our sales are primarily to major corporations  our business also depends on general economic and business conditions 
a softening of demand for our decisioning solutions caused by a weakening of the economy may result in decreased revenues or lower growth rates 
in particular  one of the challenges we face in promoting future growth in revenues is the successful refocusing of our marketing and sales efforts to our new initiatives 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to effectively promote future revenue growth in our business 
since  while the rate of account growth in the u s bankcard industry has been slowing and many of our largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard related scoring and account management business by cross selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers 
as this industry continues to consolidate  we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth 
quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and this unpredictability will likely continue in the future 
our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past 
we expect fluctuations in our operating results to continue for the foreseeable future 
consequently  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors  and in this event the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that affect our revenues and operating results include the following o decrease in recurring revenues o the lengthy sales cycle of many of our products o failure of our target markets and customers to accept our new products o our ability to successfully and timely develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements o the timing of our new product announcements and introductions in comparison with our competitors o changes in the level of our operating expenses o competitive conditions in the consumer credit industry o competitive conditions in the financial services industry o domestic and international economic conditions o changes in prevailing technologies o acquisition related expenses and charges o timing of orders for and deliveries of certain software systems o increased operating expenses related to the development of products for the internet and o other factors unique to our product lines with the exception of the cost of scorenet data purchased by us  most of our operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may have a significant impact on operating results 
our ability to increase our revenues is highly dependent upon the introduction of new products and services and if our products and services are not accepted by the marketplace  our business may be harmed 
we have a significant share of the available market for our traditional products and services  such as our alliance products and services 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to expand into newer markets for our products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending  retail and telecommunications 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our electronic commerce solution  our growth and revenues will be limited 
the failure to generate a large customer base for our new products would harm our ability to grow and increase revenues 
this failure could occur for several reasons 
some of our business to business electronic commerce competitors charge their customers large fees upon the execution of customer agreements 
businesses that have made substantial up front payments to our competitors for electronic commerce solutions may be reluctant to replace their current solution and adopt our solution 
as a result  our efforts to create a larger customer base may be more difficult than expected even if we are deemed to offer products and services superior to those of our competitors 
further  because the business to business electronic commerce market is new and underdeveloped  potential customers in this market may be confused or uncertain about the relative merits of each electronic commerce solution or which electronic commerce solution to adopt  if any 
confusion and uncertainty in the marketplace may inhibit current or potential customers from adopting our solution  which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
there are significant risks associated with the introduction of new products 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a product  especially in the area of customer relationship management  or may affect market acceptance of our products and could harm our business  results of operations or financial position 
if we were to experience delays in the commercialization and introduction of new or enhanced products  if customers were to experience significant problems with the implementation and installation of products  or if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  our business  results of operations or financial position could be harmed 
there can be no assurance that our new products will achieve significant market acceptance or will generate significant revenue 
additional products that we plan to directly or indirectly market in the future are in various stages of development 
we are expanding our technology into a number of new business areas to foster long term growth  including exchanges for a number of business procurement needs  internet electronic commerce  online business services and internet computing 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel 
there is no assurance that we will compete effectively or will generate significant revenues in these new areas 
the success of internet computing and  in particular  our current internet computing software products is difficult to predict because internet computing represents a method of computing that is relatively new to the computer industry 
the successful introduction of internet computing to the market will depend in large measure on i the lower cost of ownership of internet computing relative to client server architecture  ii the ease of use and administration relative to client server architecture  and iii the means by which hardware and software vendors choose to compete in this market 
there can be no assurances that sufficient numbers of vendors will undertake this commitment  that the market will accept internet computing or that internet computing will generate significant revenues for us 
failure to obtain data from our clients to update and re develop or to create new models could harm our business 
updates of models and development of new and enhanced models depend to a significant extent on availability of statistically relevant data 
such data is usually obtained under agreements with our clients 
refusals by clients to provide such data or to obtain permission of their customers to provide such data  and privacy and data protection restrictions  could result in loss of access to required data 
our business and the business of our clients is subject to government regulation and changes in regulation 
our current and prospective clients  which primarily consist of credit bureaus  credit card processors  state and federally chartered banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies and other consumer lenders  as well as customers in the industries that we may target in the future  operate in markets that are subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulations 
while we may not be directly subject to such regulations  our products and services must be designed to work within the extensive and evolving regulatory constraints in which our clients operate and to meet our client expectations with respect to handling data in conformity with applicable data protection laws 
these constraints include federal and state truth in lending disclosure rules  state usury laws  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the community reinvestment act and the financial services modernization act of amendments to the federal fair credit reporting act which became law in september expressly permits the use of credit bureau data to prescreen consumers for offers of credit and insurance and allows affiliated companies to share consumer information with each other subject to certain conditions 
these amendments impose a seven year moratorium on new state legislation on certain issues  however score disclosure regulation by states is not pre empted under this legislation and the states remain free to regulate the use of credit bureau data in connection with insurance underwriting 
on september   the score disclosure statute was signed into law in california and is the first legislation to require the disclosure of credit risk scores 
the score disclosure statute becomes effective july   and imposes significant new requirements on credit reporting agencies and residential creditors and brokers to disclose credit risk scores 
in addition there are several pending federal score disclosure bills and other states may follow california s lead and pass score disclosure legislation 
in september we initiated the fico guide service which delivers to lenders and brokers a personalized explanation of the factors considered in a given consumer s fico score  and suggestions on how to improve the score over time 
we believe enacted or proposed state regulation of the insurance industry has had some detrimental impact on our efforts to sell insurance risk scores through credit reporting  but state regulation has not prevented growth of such sales 
examples of recent legislation include legislation pending in missouri that would prohibit sole use of credit information in the issuance  renewal  and cancellation of policies covering private passenger automobiles and a connecticut law that will not allow use of credit inquiries in a model used in insurance underwriting 
providing an individual with control over what personal information a business collects and uses is a growing  global trend 
the recent financial services modernization act of gramm leach bliley act includes several privacy provisions and introduces new controls over the transfer and use of individual data by financial institutions 
additional federal legislation is proposed 
in addition over state privacy bills are pending 
on the international front  in the european union eu  the data protection directive became effective october and places strict controls on the collection  use and transfer of personal data 
we have registered under the us safe harbor provisions in the uk  pledging to meet the eu level of adequate protection for personal data  have another registration pending in spain and are evaluating the desirability of registering in other counties 
we expect increased costs of compliance with these regulations but such costs are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition 
furthermore  some consumer groups have expressed concern regarding the privacy and security of automated credit processing  the use of automated credit scoring tools in credit underwriting and whether electronic lending is a desirable technological development in light of the current level of consumer debt 
the failure of our products and services to support customers compliance with current regulations and to address changes in customers regulatory environment  or our failure to comply with current regulations or adapt to changes in regulatory environment  in an efficient and cost effective manner  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operations outside the united states subject us to unique risks that may harm our results of operations 
a growing portion of our revenues is derived from international sales 
during the last fiscal year  we received approximately of our revenues from business outside the united states 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o the general economic conditions in each country o incongruent tax structures o difficulty in managing an organization spread over various countries o compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations o import and export licensing requirements o trade restrictions and tariffs o longer payment cycles and o volatile exchange rates for foreign currencies there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term 
although some of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  foreign currency translation gains and losses are not currently material to our position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to foreign currency translation risks in the future 
we have found it to be impractical to hedge all foreign currencies in which we conduct business 
as a result  we have experienced non material foreign currency gains and losses and may continue to do so 
if we do not recruit and retain qualified personnel  our business could be harmed 
our continued growth and success depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel and the hiring of new qualified personnel 
competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel is becoming more intense due to lower overall unemployment rates  the dramatic increase in information technology spending and private companies that can offer equity incentives that provide the potential for greater compensation in connection with an initial public offering 
accordingly  we expect to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either improved productivity or higher prices 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in continually recruiting new personnel and in retaining existing personnel 
in general  we do not have long term employment or non competition agreements with our employees 
the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract additional qualified employees or retain other employees could harm our continued growth 
over the long term  our rate of revenue growth is likely to be limited by the rate at which we can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
we believe this constraint will continue to exist indefinitely 
at times we may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities that we believe have exceptional long term potential 
this is the basis for our strategic focus of becoming an e business company and implementing new growth initiatives targeted at the retail and telecommunications markets 
we rely upon our proprietary technology rights and if we are unable to protect them  our business could be harmed 
because the protection of our proprietary technology is limited  our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology 
we have only seven patent applications and no issued patents to date 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that others  including our competitors  will not use our proprietary technology without our consent 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be subject to possible infringement claims that could harm our business 
with recent developments in the law that permit patentability of business methods  we expect that products in the industry segments in which we compete will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlaps 
in addition  we expect to receive more patent infringement claims as companies increasingly seek to patent their software  also in light of recent developments in the law that extend the ability to patent software 
regardless of the merits  responding to any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial position could be harmed 
security is important to our business  and breaches of security  or the perception that e commerce is not secure could harm our business 
internet based  business to business electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
security breaches of networks on which netsourced products are used or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the models we use to protect content and transactions on the networks on which the netsourced products or proprietary information in our databases 
anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary  confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
further  a well publicized compromise of security could deter people from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information we are dependent upon major contracts with credit bureaus 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with the three major credit bureaus with usual terms of five years or less 
in the last fiscal year  these contracts accounted for approximately of our revenues 
if we are unable to renew any of these contracts on the same or similar terms with one or more of these credit bureaus  our revenues and results of operations may be harmed 
we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 
as part of our business strategy  we have made in the past and may make in the future acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
although we do not currently have plans to do so  any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that we will pay much more than the acquired company or assets are worth  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential product liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  the inability of management to maximize the financial and our strategic position  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
these factors could harm our business  results of operations or financial position  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition 
consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could be in the form of cash  stock  rights to purchase stock or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing stockholders and to earnings per share may result in connection with any such future acquisitions 
backlog orders may be cancelled or delayed 
there is no assurance that backlog will result in revenues 
we believe that increased revenue growth in fiscal and later years will depend to a significant extent on sales of newly developed products
