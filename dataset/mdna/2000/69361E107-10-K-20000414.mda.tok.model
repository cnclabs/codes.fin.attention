market risk at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts to sell million of various currencies 
the difference between the fair value of these outstanding contracts and the contract amounts was immaterial 
a hypothetical fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries at december  totaled million 
the potential loss in net assets resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements aggregating a notional principal amount of million 
these swaps effectively change the company s payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
based on the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements at december   the company would have received million to terminate the agreements 
a hypothetical decrease in the replacement swap rate would decrease the fair value by approximately million 
the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt was million  including current maturities  at december  a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of long term debt by approximately million 
year the year problem is the result of many existing computer programs written in two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
accordingly  date sensitive software or hardware may not be able to distinguish between the year and year  and programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting of date fields may begin yielding incorrect results 
this potentially could cause a system failure or miscalculations that could disrupt operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
to mitigate the effects of the company s or significant suppliers potential failure to remediate the year issue in a timely manner  the company will execute its contingency plan and make arrangements for alternate suppliers and utilize manual intervention to ensure the continuation of operations where necessary 
if it becomes necessary for the company to take these corrective actions  the company does not believe that this would result in significant delays in business operations or have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company incurred approximately million of incremental out of pocket costs for its year program to remediate existing computer software and hardware 
these costs do not include internal management time  which the company does not separately track  nor the deferral of other projects  the effects of which were not material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
as of this time  the company has not been made aware of any year issues nor has the year issue had a material adverse impact on results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing legacy currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies will remain in effect until july   at which time  the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions 
the company believes that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse impact to results of operations  financial position or cash flows
