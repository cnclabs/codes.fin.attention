the change in accrued liabilities in fiscal was due primarily to payments related to the boot divestiture and changes in timing of interest payments 
there were no revolving credit borrowings during fiscal  and  as cash generated from operations and cash on hand funded seasonal working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the million decrease in fiscal capital expenditures as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease of capital expenditures connected with new system initiatives related to the year which more than offset the increase in retail store capital expenditures due to the increase in new stores 
the million decrease in fiscal capital expenditures as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of major renovations in retail stores for fiscal versus fiscal total capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be approximately million 
these include expected retail expenditures of million to open up to approximately journeys stores  johnston murphy stores and factory stores  jarman retail stores which includes approximately underground station stores and three stone co

of the total project cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software and hardware which has been capitalized 
the remaining million has been expensed  including costs of million for fiscal subsequent to december   the company has not experienced any material year problems either internally or from outside sources 
the company has no reason to believe that year problems will materially affect it in the future 
however  since it may take several additional months before it is known whether the company or third party suppliers  vendors or customers may have had year problems  no assurances can be given that the company will not experience losses or disruptions due to year computer related problems 
the company will continue to monitor its operations for any year problems

changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a reasonable estimate of the probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no reasonable estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  however  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves may not be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
future capital needs the company expects that cash on hand and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund all of its capital expenditures through fiscal  although the company may borrow from time to time to support seasonal working capital requirements 
the approximately million of costs associated with the prior restructurings and discontinued operations that are expected to be incurred during the next twelve months are also expected to be funded from cash on hand

outstanding debt of the company the company s outstanding long term debt of million convertible subordinated notes due april bears interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
the fair value of the company s long term debt was million at january  based on a dealer quote 
cash and short term investments the company s cash and short term investment balances are invested in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at january  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at january   if any  is low 
foreign currency exchange rate risk most purchases by the company from foreign sources are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that import transactions are denominated in other currencies  it is the company s practice to hedge its risks through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
the loss from such transaction was million at january  at january   the company had million of foreign exchange contracts for italian lira and euro 
as of january   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
summary based on the company s overall market interest rate and foreign currency rate exposure at january   the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s consolidated financial position  result of operations or cash flows for fiscal would not be material

under certain conditions  a derivative may be specifically designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative will depend on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation
