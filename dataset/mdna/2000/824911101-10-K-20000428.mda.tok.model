an investment in shopko s common stock or other securities carries certain risks 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below  the risks described in provantage s annual report on form k filed with the sec  and other risks which may be disclosed from time to time in shopko s and provantage s filings with the sec before investing in shopko s common stock or other securities 
competition in the retail industry could limit shopko s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise and retail health services businesses 
these businesses are highly competitive 
the competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability 
the company competes with other discount retail merchants as well as mass merchants  catalog merchants  internet retailers and other general merchandise  apparel and household merchandise retailers 
the company s retail health services business competes with independent and chain pharmacies and optical centers 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers and store locations has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  kmart and target  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company expects a further increase in competition from these national discount retailers 
the company cannot assure you that it will be able to continue to compete successfully 
the company s inability to secure additional retail store sites could limit our growth opportunities 
if additional retail store sites are unavailable  the company may not be able to carry out a significant part of its growth strategy  which could materially adversely affect its future growth 
the company s plans to increase the number of its retail stores will depend in part upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites 
there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available to the company for purchase or lease  or that they will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
rising real estate costs and construction and development costs could also inhibit the company s ability to grow 
if the company is unable to grow its retail business  the company s financial performance could be adversely affected 
the company s conversion  integration and operation of companies which it acquires may not succeed or generate the expected results  which may have a significant adverse effect on its financial performance and its growth strategy and prospects 
if the company is unable to integrate companies which it acquires into its business  then its financial performance and its growth strategy and prospects may be adversely affected 
a significant part of its growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire companies which complement its business  such as pamida  inc  and to integrate those companies into its management and operational structure 
this integration requires substantial management  logistical and financial resources which might otherwise be devoted to our existing operations 
the company s failure to accommodate this growth could have a material adverse affect on its results of operations 
the company s provantage subsidiary is subject to various risks  which could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
if the company s provantage subsidiary is adversely affected by the business and other risks to which it is subject  then the company s results of operations and financial results may suffer 
for fiscal  the company s provantage subsidiary generated approximately of the company s sales and approximately of the company s income from operations 
the provantage business is substantially different from the company s retail business and is subject to additional and different risks 
to the extent these risks could materially and adversely effect provantage  they could also have a material and adverse effect on the company 
the risks that provantage is subject to include the following provantage s industry is very competitive and this competition is reducing profitability in provantage s industry 
consistent with industry practice  provantage does not have long term contracts with its customers  network pharmacies or pharmaceutical manufacturers and loss of a significant number of these contractual relationships could materially adversely affect provantage and its results of operations 
provantage is introducing new products which the market may not accept 
provantage is growing rapidly  and if provantage is unable to manage this growth  then its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
other governmental actions  including changes in healthcare finance and reimbursement practices and patient confidentiality laws  could materially adversely affect provantage 
provantage may be subject to liability claims which are not covered by insurance  which may adversely affect provantage s results of operations 
provantage relies on the use of intellectual property  such as computer software  to conduct its business  which  if not properly protected  could be lost  restricted  copied or used by other businesses which could have a material adverse effect on provantage 
the foregoing is a summary of the risk factors applicable to provantage 
for a more complete description of those risks  please see provantage s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  the company s general merchandise business is seasonal and quarterly performance fluctuates  which may cause volatility or a decline in the price of its securities 
because the company s retail business is seasonal  its results of operations may fluctuate which may lead to significant volatility or declines in the price of its securities 
the company s retail general merchandise business is highly seasonal 
the christmas selling season has historically contributed a significant part of its earnings and primarily impacts the fourth fiscal quarter 
inventory imbalances caused by unanticipated fluctuations in consumer demand also results in fluctuations of the company s results 
this seasonality and these fluctuations cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of its securities 
loss of the company s key management personnel  especially william j 
podany  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer  could materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of its senior management  particularly william j 
podany 
the company does not have employment contracts with members of its senior management  including mr 
podany 
if the company loses key senior management  then its business could be materially adversely affected 
adverse weather and general economic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
because the company s business is subject to adverse weather conditions in its retail markets  particularly in the midwest  western mountain and pacific northwest regions  its operating results may be unexpectedly and materially adversely affected 
frequent or unusually heavy snow  ice or rain storms in its markets could have a material adverse effect on its sales and earnings and could adversely impact its ability to make scheduled interest payments on its indebtedness 
general economic factors in the regions in which the company operates that are beyond its control may also materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance 
the factors that may materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance include interest rates  recession  inflation  deflation  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policy  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
labor conditions may have a material adverse impact on its performance 
if the company cannot attract and retain quality employees  its business will suffer 
the company depends on attracting and retaining quality employees 
many of its employees are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
the company may be unable to meet its labor needs while controlling costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics the company has a significant amount of debt which could adversely affect its business and growth prospects 
at january   the company had approximately million of long term debt and other long term obligations 
the company expects to incur more debt as it expands its retail operations 
this additional debt could have significant adverse effects on its business 
for example  it could make it more difficult for it to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest on its debt  limit its ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns  and contain certain covenants which restrict our ability to operate its business 
anti takeover provisions in the company s organizational documents and statutes may inhibit premium offers for its common stock 
anti takeover provisions in its amended and restated articles of incorporation  by laws and wisconsin law and its rights plan may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control of the company 
this could make the company less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive its shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at a premium price 
pending or future litigation could subject the company to significant monetary damages 
if the company becomes subject to liability claims which are in excess of its insurance coverage or are not covered by its insurance policies  the company may be liable for damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claims against the company  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may have a material adverse effect on its reputation and business 
the sale of retail merchandise and provision of in store pharmacy and optical services entail a risk of litigation and liability 
the company is currently subject to a number of lawsuits  and expects that from time to time it will be subject to similar suits in the ordinary course of business 
the company currently maintains insurance intended to cover a majority of liability claims  subject to a  deductible for general liability claims and for liability claims arising from prescription dispensing errors 
the company believes that its insurance programs are adequate 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to maintain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  or that insurance will cover all claims against the company
