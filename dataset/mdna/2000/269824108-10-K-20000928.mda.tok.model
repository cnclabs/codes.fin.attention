item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company was founded in and during the remainder of the s focused on developing and marketing a software application product for use by roadway design professionals 
in  the company  under new management  began to expand significantly its product line to include complementary software application products for use by a variety of aec professionals 
the expansion of its product line was accomplished through both internal development and through acquisitions 
on july   the company added modules of building designed construction software as a result of the cibc acquisition 
on december   the company added nine modules of land surveying software as a result of the smi acquisition 
these acquisitions were each accounted for under the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of operations of such businesses are included in the company s results from their respective dates of acquisition 
for each acquisition  the aggregate cost over the fair value of acquired net assets has been assigned principally to purchased research and development and software development costs based on their estimated fair market values 
the portion of the aggregate purchase prices allocated to research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was charged to expense on the date of purchase 
accordingly  the company s results of operations reflect a non recurring charge for purchased research and development of approximately  for fiscal in autodesk  the company whose cad platform the majority of the company s business is based upon bought softdesk  a major competitor of eagle point 
additionally  in bentley systems  the developer of the microstation cad platform upon which a portion of the company s civil engineering surveying modules are based  purchased an equity interest in geopak  also a competitor of the company 
in bentley systems also acquired the civil engineering product line from intergraph corporation  also a competitor of the company 
as a result of these situations  eagle point began to compete with companies with whom it previously did not compete 
as further evidence of the increased competitive pressures  during fiscal year  autodesk notified eagle point that eagle point would no longer be allowed to resell autocad 
autocad resales accounted for approximately  or million  of the company s revenues and  or  of the company s gross profit for fiscal there were no autocad resales in fiscal year or in fiscal year the inability to resell autocad has had an adverse effect on the company s revenues and gross profit 
see risk factors competition 
the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
factors such as the timing of new product introductions and upgrades by the company  the company s competitors or autodesk  customer acceptance of software applications  product development expenses  announcements or changes in pricing policies by competitors  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  the mix of domestic versus international revenues  the existence of product errors or bugs  and the hiring and training of additional staff could contribute to this variability of quarterly results 
economic and other factors affecting the civil engineering  surveying  architectural  home building  structural engineering  landscape and hydrological industries could also affect demand for the company s products in one or more particular quarters 
a significant portion of the company s net revenues in a quarter are derived from orders received in the latter part of the quarter  which makes the company s financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn in business and quarterly results difficult to forecast 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels  and a shortfall in revenues could result in a disproportionate decrease in the company s net income 
as the markets in which the company competes mature and new and existing companies compete for customers  price competition is likely to intensify and such competition could affect quarterly operating results

effective september  the employment of john biver  the vice president civil division of the company  terminated 
pursuant to the terms of mr 
biver s employment agreement  he will receive severance benefits totaling approximately  substantially all of which will be paid in the first or second quarter of fiscal year inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operating results to date  nor does the company expect it to have a significant impact in fiscal year the company has experienced insignificant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions since substantially all of its international sales to date have been billed in us dollars 
as the company continues its international operations  it may begin billing in foreign currencies which would increase the company s exposure to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts if deemed appropriate at that time
