item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits 
through our design expertise  process technology expertise and specialized application knowledge  we have developed and sell approximately innovative products  including amplifiers  drivers  faders  transceivers and multiplexers  to a large and diverse group of customers worldwide 
we target four high growth commercial markets video  optical storage  communications and power management 
we were incorporated in california in july as elantec  inc in september  we reincorporated in delaware as elantec semiconductor  inc  and in october  we completed our initial public offering 
we introduced our first products in fiscal  and  during the period from fiscal to fiscal  military and commercial hybrid product sales represented the majority of our net revenues 
beginning in fiscal  we changed our strategy to focus on high growth commercial markets 
we announced the discontinuance of our military and commercial hybrid products in july  and shipments of these products ended in september beginning in fiscal  we narrowed our product focus  concentrating on our current markets where we could exploit our design and process technology expertise 
we opened a design center in the united kingdom in the third quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we took an unusual charge of million under a plan to restructure our manufacturing operations by moving towards a primarily outsourced model 
we restructured our operations in response to a shift in the mix of products fabricated internally compared to products fabricated by outside foundries  which caused significant over capacity in our internal inch fabrication facility 
our net revenues are derived from the sale of analog integrated circuits 
we have developed a broad range of high performance application specific standard products  or assps  and standard products for our four target markets 
in fiscal  video represented  optical storage represented  communications represented  and power management and others represented of net revenues 
we sell our products both domestically and internationally to a large and diverse group of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  through a combination of direct sales offices  independent sales representatives and distributors 
in fiscal  sales to microtek international in japan and samsung electronics in korea accounted for and  respectively of our net revenues 
microtek is a distributor who sells to a diverse base of oems  while samsung is one of our direct customers 
we have focused our sales and marketing efforts in asia  north america and europe 
during the year ended september  and for fiscal and fiscal  approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of north america 
our customers are both distributors and oems 
the majority of our international net revenues are derived from sales through our distributors 
we work with distributors in asia and nine distributors covering europe  africa  south america and australia  each selling to oems within their own territory 
we also work with four distributors and independent sales representatives in north america 
while we are continuing to expand our sales organizations worldwide  we expect that the majority of our net revenues will continue to be derived from asia in the foreseeable future 
some of our net revenues from sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen while the remaining net revenues from sales worldwide are denominated in united states dollars 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to direct customers  at the time of shipment to foreign distributors  and at the time domestic distributors sell our products to their customers 
allowances are provided for estimated returns at the time of shipment 
our domestic distributors have rights of return and price protection privileges on unsold merchandise 
net revenues are stated net of estimated discounts and allowances 
we work with our customers to achieve design wins whereby our products will be incorporated into our customers product 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation of their products and begin the marketing process 
several months may elapse between our sales efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchases of our products 
the duration of the actual lapse depends upon the product type and market segment 
our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice 
we manufacture semiconductor wafers using our proprietary dielectric isolation and silicon on insulator technologies 
in addition  we utilize a limited number of third party foundries for the manufacture of our junction isolation complementary bipolar and complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  wafers 
we use third party subcontractors for assembly and packaging services 
we place purchase orders for specific quantities of wafers  and assembly and packaging services 
we test all wafers produced by us and our third party foundries 
in addition  we perform final testing on all packaged units 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our manufacturing subcontractors 
costs of revenues also encompass our internal manufacturing and operations functions and a portion of our information systems and facilities costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  prototype costs related to the fabrication of our integrated circuits  and depreciation associated with development tools 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development initiatives require significant expenditures  such as prototype expenses  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
because our research and development is critical to our future success  we expect to continue to increase our research and development expenditures 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions and related expenses for executives  finance  accounting  information services  human resources  recruiting  professional fees and other corporate expenses  and costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities 
we expect to continue to expand our direct and indirect sales operations in an attempt to secure more design wins and increase product orders 
we expect these expenses will increase over the next year as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  initiate additional marketing programs to support our products  establish new sales offices  amortize deferred compensation associated with the hiring of our new chief executive officer  add personnel and incur additional costs related to the continued growth of our business 
we will continue to expand our use of independent sales representatives 
in addition  the complexity of integrating our products within our customer s systems requires highly trained field application engineers  customer service and support personnel 
we plan to continue to expand our field application engineering and our customer service and support organization 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  certain consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
year ended september  net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing  sales  general and administrative unusual charges income loss from operations income loss before income taxes net income loss years ended september   and net revenues 
in fiscal  net revenues were million  an increase of from the million reported in fiscal this increase over the prior year was due to a significant increase in total units shipped despite a decline in average selling prices 
sales increased in all geographic areas  especially in asia 
in fiscal  international net revenues were compared to in fiscal this increase was due primarily to strong demand for our video and optical storage products resulting from improved demand as well as improved conditions in asia 
domestic net revenues in fiscal increased slightly to million from million in fiscal as a result of increased sales of our products despite the discontinuation of our military and commercial hybrid product line at the end of fiscal this product line accounted for million or of our product revenues in fiscal as a percentage of total net revenues  domestic net revenues in fiscal decreased from in fiscal to 
net revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of over net revenues of million in fiscal the increase in net revenues was due to an increase in unit shipments  while the average selling price for our products remained relatively constant during the year 
we experienced strong revenue growth in the optical storage market  which represented of net revenues  up from approximately of net revenues in fiscal international net revenues represented of net revenues in fiscal  up slightly from of net revenues in fiscal net revenues from japan and other pacific rim countries increased over fiscal as a result of improvement in the economic and financial situation in the region 
in fiscal  domestic net revenues remained flat in absolute dollars compared to  but as a percentage of our net revenues decreased to compared to in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to in the corresponding period in fiscal the improvement in gross margin reflects the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs across a higher revenue base and improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and yields as well as the write down of inventory in the first quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a plan to restructure our manufacturing operations by moving towards a primarily outsourced model through a period of several years 
we further decided to discontinue development of future dielectric process technology in favor of the silicon on insulator technology  where volume production is expected to be outsourced if a suitable foundry is qualified 
as a result of that decision  we concluded that certain quantities of dielectric inventory in excess of known customer demand might become obsolete 
of the million write down of inventory in the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million related to work in process and approximately million related to finished goods 
the amount of dielectric inventory on the balance sheet  after the write down  at september  was million in work in process and million in finished goods 
while we are working on programs to continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies  we may encounter difficulties due to delays with technology introduction  changes in product mix  unfavorable manufacturing yields or other manufacturing difficulties in the future 
gross margin may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
gross margin was million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues as compared to in fiscal was due primarily to the absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base and improved manufacturing yields and pricing at third party foundries 
this increase was partially offset by higher unfavorable overhead variances relating to internal production and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal as product mix shifted towards products manufactured by third party foundries 
the improvement in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal also resulted from our change in strategy  discussed above 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  research and development expenses were of net revenue 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in staffing and related compensation of million  particularly design engineering personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers of million and prototype costs and depreciation associated with development tools of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we also opened a design center in the united kingdom 
research and development expenses were million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to was due primarily to an increase in staffing and related compensation of million  particularly design engineering personnel  and higher spending of million on new product designs 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses increased by million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses were of net revenue 
the increase in these expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in staffing and related compensation of million  particularly sales and marketing personnel  fees paid to consultants of million and higher commissions paid to outside manufacturer s representatives and other selling expenses of million due to the increase in net revenues 
marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses were million or of net revenues in fiscal and million or of net revenues in fiscal the increase in these expenses in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to an increase in staffing and related compensation of million and higher outside services costs of million 
as a percentage of net sales  marketing  sales  general and administrative expenses remained flat in fiscal as such costs increased at the same rate as net revenue growth 
unusual charges 
our unusual charges  as discussed in gross margin for fiscal and fiscal  consisted primarily of a write down of certain equipment  a write down of inventory  severance costs and a write down of previously capitalized patent costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these actions resulted in pretax charges of million to operating expenses and million to cost of goods sold 
approximately million was utilized in fiscal and million was utilized in fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million in fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal the increase in interest and other income was due primarily to higher levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and gains from the sale of foreign exchange forward contracts 
interest and other income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to a lower rate of return on cash equivalents and short term investments 
provision for benefit from taxes on income 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for the comparable prior year period 
the fiscal provision for taxes on income reflected the benefit from the unusual charges we recorded in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance of million due to the conclusion that realization of the remaining deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance is more likely than not 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results for the fourth fiscal quarter of included a million favorable tax adjustment resulting primarily from the reversal of our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets at september  factors affecting future operating results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this annual report on form k  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors as  among others  delays in new product and process technology announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix or markets in which products are sold  availability and costs of raw materials  reliance on subcontractors  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  political and economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as under utilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  litigation  or environmental regulation and other factors described below 
the markets in which we participate are intensely competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  our operating results could be harmed 
the analog semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
competition among analog semiconductor providers is intense at the design in stage  when a manufacturer is selecting a component provider for potential generations of future products 
increased competition has in the past  and could in the future  result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could harm our operating results 
in our primary markets  we compete with analog devices  inc  burr brown corporation  linear technology corporation  maxim integrated products  inc  national semiconductor corporation  texas instruments and toshiba 
we also compete indirectly with the in house design staffs of some of our customers  which often provide alternative solutions for individual analog systems requirements 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products  and reduce prices to increase market share 
moreover  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors 
these combinations may provide our competitors and potential competitors with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs 
in addition  the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants may increase competitive pressures 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry has historically led to substantial decreases in demand for our products and technologies and may do so in the future 
although the semiconductor industry has recently experienced strong demand  the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future 
as a result  our operating results are subject to significant variation 
the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn in and that seriously harmed our operating results during that period 
our business depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for analog semiconductors and products using analog semiconductors 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry will likely lead to proportionately greater downturns in our net income or increases in net losses 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate  which could cause us to miss expectations about those results and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate  and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
some of the important factors that could cause our net revenues and operating results to fluctuate from period to period include shifts in demand for  and average selling prices of  our products  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by our customers  the timing and success of product introductions and new technologies by our competitors and us  the quantities of our products which we or third parties can manufacture and deliver in a quarter  the timing of our investments in research and development  the timing and provision of pricing protections and returns from our customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the length of our sales cycle  availability of manufacturing capacity for our products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and changes in product mix 
although our net revenues have increased in recent quarters  fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results due to these factors could prevent us from sustaining these growth rates 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our net revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and  accordingly  that these comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we depend upon the continued demand for our products in the video and optical storage markets for a significant portion of our net revenues 
we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our net revenues from products that we sell in the video and optical storage markets 
therefore  our success depends in part on the continued acceptance of our products within these markets and our ability to continue to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis for these markets 
in addition  although the video and optical storage markets have grown rapidly in the last few years  we cannot be certain that these markets will continue to grow or that a significant slowdown in these markets will not occur 
any downturn in these markets could harm our business and operating results 
the failure to manage and sustain our growth may harm our business 
our ability to continue to grow successfully requires an effective planning and management process 
since september   we increased our headcount substantially  from employees to employees as of september  our growth has placed  and the recruitment and integration of additional employees will continue to place  a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our operational  financial and management information systems in a timely and efficient manner and invest the necessary capital 
we cannot assure you that those resources will be available when we need them or that we will have sufficient capital to invest when required 
if we are unable to manage and sustain our growth  our operating results may be harmed 
difficulties in estimating the amount and timing of sales to our customers could harm our operating results 
it is difficult for us to forecast accurately the timing and amount of sales to our customers  which include distributors and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our products and technologies before committing to design our products into their systems 
in addition  some of the oems who purchase products from us or our distributors require a set of related products from multiple manufacturers to be delivered to them together for a complete bill of materials 
delays in delivery by other vendors could result in delayed or cancelled sales of our products 
moreover  our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled on short notice to us and without significant penalty 
we do not have substantial noncancellable backlog and often we are forced to obtain inventory and materials from our manufacturing subcontractors in advance of anticipated customer demand 
because we incur expenses  many of which are fixed  based in part on our forecasts of future product sales  our operating results could be harmed if sales levels are below our expectations 
our net revenues may decrease if we lose any of our significant customers  thereby harming our operating results 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenues in any particular period 
in fiscal  microtek international  inc accounted for of our net revenues and samsung accounted for 
in fiscal  microtek accounted for of our net revenues and insight a domestic distributor accounted for 
the loss of any significant customer coupled with our inability to obtain orders from new customers to compensate for such loss could cause our net revenues to decline  thereby harming our operating results 
we have no long term purchase commitments with these or any of our other important customers 
these customers  therefore  could cease purchasing our products with short notice to us and without significant penalty 
in addition  microtek and insight are distributors of our products to various oems  any of whom could choose to reduce or eliminate orders that would reduce our distributor s orders for our products 
because we anticipate that sales of our products to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues  the following may reduce our operating results reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant distributors or oems  development by one or more of our significant customers of other sources of supply  selection by one or more of our significant oems of devices manufactured by one or more of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  sales of competing products by our distributors  or failure of one of our significant customers to make timely payment of our invoices 
we must achieve new design wins  and these design wins must translate into customer purchases 
our success depends in part upon achieving design wins for our products with current and future customers 
design wins are indications by existing and potential customers that they intend to incorporate our products into their new product designs 
to achieve design wins  we must continually increase the performance levels of our products  keep pace with evolving industry standards and introduce new products in a timely manner 
if we fail to achieve design wins  we may lose potential sales opportunities 
design wins also do not necessarily result in purchase orders for our products 
in addition  it could take up to several months before a design win translates into a purchase order  if at all 
the value of any design win  moreover  will largely depend upon the commercial success of our customer s product and on the extent to which the design of the customer s electronic system accommodates components manufactured by our competitors 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
we operate in an industry that is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions  product obsolescence  and ongoing demands for greater performance and functionality 
we  therefore  must continually design  develop and introduce on a timely basis new products with improved features to retain and attract customers and be competitive 
successful product development and introduction on a timely basis requires that we design innovative and performance enhancing features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  transition our products to new manufacturing technologies  identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  including new standards for our products  accurately identify and design new products to meet market needs  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices and maintain effective marketing strategies  maintain a high level of investment in research and development  respond effectively to technological changes or product announcements by others  and adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the design and market introduction schedules for our new products or enhancements to our existing products or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
in order to remain competitive in the analog semiconductor industry  we must develop and introduce new semiconductor design and manufacturing process technologies on a timely basis 
our future success depends upon our ability to design and develop products that utilize new manufacturing process technologies  secure the availability of our new manufacturing process technologies from our foundries  introduce new manufacturing process technologies to the marketplace earlier than our competitors do  and transfer our product design to multiple foundries efficiently 
semiconductor design and manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid technological change  and require large expenditures for research and development 
we incurred research and development expenses of million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  we expect that our expenses for research and development will continue to increase because we continuously attempt  on a product by product basis  to migrate to smaller geometry process technologies 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields or delays in product deliveries 
while we believe that transitioning our products to smaller geometries will be important for us to remain competitive  we cannot be certain that we can make these transitions successfully and on a cost effective basis 
due to our significant level of international net revenues and the utilization of foreign manufacturers and subcontractors  we are subject to international operational  financial and political risks 
sales of our products to customers outside the united states have accounted for a significant part of our net revenues 
our total international net revenues  as a percentage of our net revenues  were for the year ended september   for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  we expect our international net revenues  particularly into japan  taiwan and korea  to continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues in the future 
in addition  we expect to continue to rely on manufacturers and subcontractors located in taiwan  malaysia and thailand 
accordingly  we will be subject to risks and challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our business only in the united states 
these include compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  changes in laws and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products  legal uncertainties regarding taxes  tariffs  quotas  export controls  export licenses and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in or foreign conflicts involving the countries of our customers  manufacturers and subcontractors causing delays or reductions in orders for our products  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in staffing and managing personnel  distributors and representatives in foreign countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  particularly in asia  currency exchange rate fluctuations  which could increase the price of our products in local currencies and thereby reduce our net revenues from these sales  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  and fluctuations in freight rates and transportation disruptions 
any of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand our international net revenues in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we depend on a limited number of third party foundries to manufacture most of our products  which reduces our control over the production  supply and delivery of our products 
we depend on a limited number of third party foundries for the production of most of our products 
in particular  lucent technologies inc manufactures all of our junction isolation complementary bipolar wafers  and american microsystems  inc and united microelectronics corporation manufacture all of our complementary metal oxide semiconductor wafers 
in addition  another foundry provides poly deposition on all of our dielectric isolation wafers and silicon on insulator wafers 
our dependence on third parties to fabricate our products has significant risks that could potentially harm our operating results  including we have no long term contracts with any foundry and we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity at any foundry 
the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by its available capacity and our foundry suppliers could provide that limited capacity to its other customers 
in addition  our foundry suppliers could reduce or even eliminate the capacity allocated to us on short notice 
moreover  such a reduction or elimination is possible even after we have submitted a purchase order 
to obtain foundry capacity  we may be forced to enter into equity and debt financing arrangements 
these arrangements could result in the dilution of our earnings or in the ownership of our stockholders 
we provide the foundries with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  however  our forecasts of production requirements may prove to be inaccurate 
we have limited control over product delivery schedules  and we may not receive products within the time frames and in the volumes required by our customers 
we could face delays in obtaining  or we might not be able to obtain  access to foundries with key fabrication process technologies  such as the fabrication process necessary to manufacture dielectric isolation wafers and silicon on insulator wafers 
we have limited control over quality assurance and production costs 
we have limited control over manufacturing yields and our foundries occasionally experience lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the design  installation and initiation of new process technologies 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our good relationships with our existing foundries 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to form relationships with other foundries as favorable as our current ones 
moreover  transferring from our existing foundries to another foundry could require a significant amount of time and loss of revenue  and we cannot assure you that we could make a smooth and timely transition 
if foundries are unable or unwilling to continue to supply us with these semiconductor devices in required time frames and volumes or at commercially acceptable costs  our business may be harmed 
we are responsible for the production of our dielectric isolation wafers and silicon on insulator wafers and our results of operations could be harmed if our supply of those wafers does not meet the demand 
our own fabrication facilities are the only facilities currently available to us that are capable of manufacturing dielectric isolation wafers and silicon on insulator wafers for our products 
if we experience a reduction or interruption in the supply  or a degradation in the quality of any of the wafers  we may be forced to discontinue products based upon those wafers until we can contract with third party foundries that are qualified to produce those wafers 
as a result  our relationships with our customers could be harmed if we are unable to deliver sufficient quantities of wafers 
we intend to outsource the high volume production of silicon on insulator wafers in the future 
we intend to transfer the process to a suitable foundry  but we cannot provide any assurance that a suitable foundry can be qualified for this production 
if we are unable to locate and qualify a suitable foundry  we will be required to make significant capital investments in our internal foundry capacity  which is likely to increase our costs of doing business 
if we fail to develop our next generation silicon on insulator technology in a timely manner  our business and operating results could be harmed 
part of our future product development strategy includes the development of an advanced silicon on insulator technology 
as with the development of any process technology  we cannot assure you that this new technology can be successfully implemented in a timely manner or that it will provide the desired improvements over our current technology 
in addition  our next generation silicon on insulator technology could be supplanted by alternative new technologies and may not be able to be transferred to third party foundries 
significant delays or cancellation of the development of this new generation of technology or manufacturing problems associated with transferring our current product line to this technology could harm our business and results of operations 
significant delays or cancellation of the development of this technology also could harm our new product development program 
we rely on a limited number of packaging subcontractors that may not have adequate capacity to meet our product delivery requirements 
we rely on a limited number of packaging subcontractors with whom we do not have long term contracts 
in general  the wafers we manufacture at our fabrication facilities and the wafers we purchase from our outside foundries are tested at our facilities 
the wafers are then sent to our packaging subcontractors for packaging and assembling 
our reliance on these subcontractors involves significant risks  including a lack of adequate capacity  the possibility that they may eliminate the necessary manufacturing process technologies  and reduced control over quality and delivery schedules 
these independent subcontractors may discontinue doing business with us for a variety of reasons 
as a result  we may experience product delivery and quality assurance problems  which in turn may harm our reputation and operating results 
if our products contain defects or fail to achieve industry reliability standards  our reputation may be harmed  and we may incur significant unexpected expenses and lose sales opportunities 
our products have in the past occasionally contained  and may in the future contain  undetected errors or defects 
any similar problem in the future may cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  cause us to incur increased charges due to obsolete or unusable inventory  require design modifications  or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products  which could result in product returns 
in addition  we may not find defects or failures in our products until after commencement of commercial shipments  which may result in loss or delay in market acceptance and could significantly harm our operating results 
our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any of these claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and business 
earthquakes  other natural disasters and power shortages may damage our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend 
our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults which have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in addition  some of the foundries  suppliers and other third parties upon which we rely are located near fault lines 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster near one or more of the facilities of third parties upon which we rely  like the earthquake in taiwan in september  could disrupt the operations of those parties 
additionally  the loss of power  such as the temporary loss of power caused by power shortages in the grid servicing our facilities in northern california  could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems 
none of these disruptions would be covered by insurance  so the supply of our products could be limited and our business could be hampered 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our key management and technical personnel  and on our continued ability to hire  integrate and retain qualified management and technical personnel  particularly engineers 
competition for these employees in the analog semiconductor industry is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining these personnel 
in addition  even if we are able to attract qualified personnel  it is difficult to obtain work visas for foreign professionals trained in the united states 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees as needed could impair our ability to meet customer and technological demands 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel could harm our business 
to help retain the continued services of some of our key executives  we have entered into employment agreements with some of them 
we do not have key person life insurance on any of our key personnel 
if digital integrated circuits replace analog integrated circuits  our business  which depends on the demand for products based on analog technologies  may fail 
all of our products are based on analog technologies 
however  as digital integrated circuits have become faster and their processing capacity has expanded  digital circuits have increasingly been used to perform functions in electronic systems that were previously performed with analog technologies 
we cannot assure you that further advances in digital processing power will not eventually supplant analog technologies in those new applications  which could harm our business and results of operations 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our competitors could market products with similar features  reducing demand for our products and harming our operating results 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights covering our products and technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  and the enforcement of those laws  do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we also cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate  patents will issue from our currently pending or future applications  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the united states or foreign countries  or others will not misappropriate our proprietary technologies or independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this litigation  whether or not it is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
from time to time we may be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  or to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid  which could result in significant expense and loss of intellectual property rights 
from time to time we have received  and  in the future  may receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights or claims that our trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of these rights 
the resolution of any claims of this nature  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays 
in the event of an adverse ruling  we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of access to any intellectual property could harm our business 
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities  and new laws and regulations or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign governmental laws and regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing of semiconductor wafers 
our failure to comply with present or future environmental laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of our production or a cessation of our operations 
any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liabilities  thereby harming our business and operating results 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations or changes in regulatory interpretation and enforcement could render compliance more difficult and costly and require significant capital expenditures 
we may require additional capital to fund our capital expenditures and operations  however  such capital may not be available 
the operation of our fabrication facility requires the continued investment of substantial capital 
we intend to make capital investments to support business growth and achieve manufacturing cost reductions and improved yields 
we may need equity or debt financing to fund further expansion of our wafer fabrication capacity or to fund other projects 
the timing and amount of these capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  our product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on terms satisfactory to us 
we may engage in future acquisitions  which could harm our profitability  put a strain on our resources  or cause dilution to our stockholders 
while we have made no acquisitions of businesses in the past  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
integrating newly acquired organizations  products or technologies into our business could be expensive  time consuming and may not be successful 
future acquisitions could divert our management s attention from other business concerns and expose our business to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets 
in addition  we may lose key employees while integrating new organizations 
consequently  we may not be successful in integrating any acquired business  products or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in customer dissatisfaction  performance problems with an acquired company  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances  any of which could harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market for securities of technology companies in general  and of companies in the semiconductor industry  including us in particular  has been highly volatile 
it is likely that the trading price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include responses to fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or product enhancements  joint ventures or significant agreements by us or our competitors  our sales of common stock or other securities in the future  general conditions in the video  optical storage  communications and power management markets  and changes in financial estimates or recommendations by market analysts regarding us and our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume volatility that has particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results of these companies 
as a result  any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of elantec or changes in our management and therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
delaware corporate law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that you may deem advantageous 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval with rights senior to those of common stock  limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock outstanding  subject to limitations stated in the stockholder rights plan 
these rights may delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at september  cash and cash equivalents were million at september   representing an increase of million from september  the increase is primarily a result of net proceeds of million from a secondary stock offering in september  cash generated from operations of million and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
these cash inflows were offset by capital expenditures of approximately million primarily for new process development  assembly and test facilities and payments on capital leases of approximately million 
cash and cash equivalents at september  increased by million from september  to million 
the primary source of cash during fiscal was million from operations 
investing activities used million primarily due to the acquisition of million in property  equipment and other assets  net of proceeds from disposition of property and equipment  which was partially offset by net sales of available for sale securities of million 
financing activities used million  primarily for payments on long term debt of million and payments on capital lease financing of million  which was partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to support our operating and capital needs for at least the next months 
any major change in the nature of our business  such as the acquisition of products  the design of products not currently under development or the need for significant unplanned capital expenditures  could change our capital requirements 
to the extent we require additional cash  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate sensitivity we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at september   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we presently intend to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden short term change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
at september   we had approximately million of outstanding obligations under capital lease arrangements 
as the lease payments associated with these arrangements do not have variable interest rates  an increase of in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our net income or cash flows 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
since we do not have any significant exposure to changing interest rates because of the low levels of marketable securities with maturities more than days  we did not undertake any specific actions to cover exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we did not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk the japanese yen and british pound are the functional currencies of our subsidiaries in japan and the united kingdom  respectively 
we also denominate certain sales transactions in yen 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts or forward contracts of various durations to hedge trade receivables denominated in yen 
under this program  gains and losses on the forward contracts mitigate the risk of material foreign currency transaction gains and losses and offset increases or decreases in our foreign currency receivables 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
we believe that the use of foreign currency financial instruments should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposures of our subsidiaries in japan and the united kingdom  and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in yen and pound sterling 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the united states dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rate at september   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
