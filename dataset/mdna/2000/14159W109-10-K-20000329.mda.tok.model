item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of please read the section below titled factors affecting future results to review conditions which we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as believes  anticipates  expects  intends  plans  will  may and similar expressions 
in addition  any statements that refer to our plans  expectations  strategies or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
our business may have changed since the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we were founded in from through september  we engaged in the research  development and sale of surgical laser products principally for procedures such as atherectomy and arthroscopy 
in  we determined that there was a significant opportunity in the tmr market  and that we were well positioned to enter this market because of our expertise with laser based surgical techniques and the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
accordingly  in late  we changed our strategic direction to enter the tmr market 
prior to  we focused almost exclusively on research and development activities relating to surgical laser products 
since  we have focused on tmr and ptmr activities  particularly research and development activities and clinical trials 
on march   we announced with cardiogenesis corporation the completion of our business combination 
under the terms of the combination  each share of cardiogenesis common stock has been converted into of a share of our common stock  and we have assumed all outstanding cardiogenesis stock options 
cardiogenesis has become a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and its shares are no longer publicly traded 
as a result of the transaction  we increased our outstanding shares by approximately million 
as of march  these shares represented approximately of our post combination outstanding shares 
the transaction was structured to qualify as a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests  consequently  all prior period figures have been restated as if the combined entity existed for all periods presented 
there were no inter company transactions between the companies prior to the date of the business combination 
the fiscal year remained the same and thus  there were no changes in retained earnings due to the business combination 
further  there were no required adjustments needed to conform to the accounting policies between the two companies 
on february   we received final approval from the fda for our tmr products for certain indications and are now able to sell those products in the us on a commercial basis 
we have also received the european conforming mark ce mark allowing the commercial sale of our tmr laser systems and our ptmr catheter system to customers in the european community 
effective july   health care financial administration began providing medicare coverage for tmr 
hospitals and physicians are now eligible to receive medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we expect to continue to incur operating losses related to the expansion of sales and marketing resources  research and development activities  including clinical studies  and the continued development of corporate infrastructure 
the timing and amounts of our expenditures will depend upon a number of factors  including the efforts required to develop our sales and marketing organization  the timing of market acceptance  if any  of our products  the progress of our clinical trials  and the status and timing of regulatory approvals 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to net revenues of  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due to higher sales of laser systems and disposable products resulting from the receipt of fda approval on our tmr products 
export sales accounted for approximately and of total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the percentage decrease relative to total sales is mainly due to higher domestic sales from the receipt of fda approval on our tmr products 
we define export sales as sales to customers located outside of the united states 
see risk factors 
gross profit gross profit increased to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  the increase in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales resulted from greater sales volume  a higher average sales price per laser and lower unit costs due to lower fixed manufacturing expenses and higher production volumes 
research and development research and development expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses reflects the decrease in activity associated with clinical trials  lower employee expenses and cost savings resulting from the merger 
some of our products are currently in clinical trials and therefore subject to limitations by the fda 
we believe that a continued investment in the development of new and improved products and procedures and in our clinical trials is critical to our future success 
as a result of the fda approval of our surgical tmr system and the coverage notice by hcfa for july   we anticipate that the level of research and development expenditures incurred in connection with clinical trials will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
however  future revenues may not be sufficient to cover the research and development expenses required in connection with our ongoing efforts including current and future clinical trials 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in absolute dollars is due to cost efficiencies realized from the merger 
we expect that spending on sales and marketing will increase as we continue to focus resources on the development of the tmr and ptmr market 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by  or to  in from  in the decrease is due to a reduction in litigation expenses and cost savings resulting from the merger 
merger related costs cardiogenesis was a medical device company like us  which developed  manufactured  and marketed cardiac revascularization products for the treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease and severe angina pain through tmr and ptmr 
cardiogenesis also manufactured and marketed disposable products to perform intraoperative transmyocardial revascularization  catheter based percutaneous myocardial revascularization  and thorascopic transmyocardial revascularization to treat patients afflicted with debilitating angina 
during the quarter ended march   we recognized merger related costs of  for financial advisory and legal fees  personnel severance  terminated relationships and other costs including write offs of fixed assets and inventory 
a majority of the terminated employees were located in california and worked in operations  sales  marketing  quality  research and development and administrative functions 
a total of employees were terminated 
during the remaining three quarters in the year ended december   we recognized additional merger related costs of  bringing the total of merger related costs to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was mainly due to a change associated with an upgrade program to replace customer owned equipment rendered unusable by the merger 
we do not expect any further charges for merger related expense and anticipate the last merger related payment to occur in july of the following table summarizes the merger related costs in thousands 
description amount financial advisory and legal fees  personnel severance  terminated relationships contracts other costs including fixed asset and inventory write offs  total  interest and other income expense  net interest and other income of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a lower level of debt outstanding 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to net revenues of  for the year ended december  the increase was a result of higher laser system and disposable product sales 
gross profit gross profit increased to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  the increase resulted from greater sales volume and a higher average sales price per laser in compared to the increase in sales volumes in resulted in increased production volumes  which resulted in lower per unit manufacturing costs as a result of production efficiencies 
research and development research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses reflected a higher level of costs related to the development of new products  increases in the number of clinical trials and the cost of supporting these trials 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increases in headcount  sales commissions and physician training 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased  or to  in from  in the increase for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  reflects an increase in litigation expense 
interest and other income expense  net interest income of  decreased  or for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower investments in marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense of  increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to a note payable held by our subsidiary  microheart  inc from october to october liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were  at december  compared to  at december   a decrease of 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are readily marketable at their fair market value 
we used  of cash for operating activities  including funding our operating loss and decreases in accrued liabilities in investing activities  consisting primarily of purchases and sale of marketable securities and additions to property and equipment  provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal years  and respectively 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal years  and respectively primarily from the issuance of stock pursuant to exercise of stock options and warrants 
since our inception  we have satisfied our capital requirements primarily through sales of our equity securities and  to a lesser extent  loans from shareholders 
in addition  our operation has been funded in part through sales of our products 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements through december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional sources of cash at an earlier date 
if we are required to obtain additional financing in the future  capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
year we have not incurred material costs associated with our efforts to become year compliant 
furthermore  based on our assessment to date  we believe that any future costs associated with our year compliance efforts will not be material 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after july  we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in december  the securities exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the sec 
we believe that adopting sab will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
factors affecting future results in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
we may fail to obtain required regulatory approvals to market our products in the united states 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following events  circumstances or occurrences related to the regulatory process the failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products  significant limitations in the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed  substantial costs incurred in obtaining regulatory approvals  or delays in initiating or completing new clinical trials 
we must submit  and the fda must approve applications for preliminary market approval  known as pma  before we can sell our tmr and ptmr laser systems as medical devices 
before submitting a pma application  we must complete clinical testing to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our products 
in  we submitted a pma application to the fda for certain applications of our tmr laser system 
on october   an advisory panel of the fda recommended that the fda approve our pma application for the tmr laser system 
along with our approval  the fda panel requested that we conduct postmarket surveillance in a form to be determined through further discussions with the fda 
on february   we received final approval from the fda for use of our tmr products for treatment of stable patients with angina canadian cardiovascular society class refractory to other medical treatments and secondary to objectively demonstrated coronary artery atherosclerosis and with a region of the myocardium with reversible ischemia not amenable to direct coronary revascularization 
in february  we obtained fda clearance to undertake phase i of a clinical study of tmr intended to assess the safety and effectiveness of tmr used in conjunction with cabg as compared with cabg alone 
in september  the fda provided us with clearance to begin phase ii of this study  which was subsequently completed 
in july  we submitted a pma supplement to fda for an expanded indication to our approved tmr labeling to include tmr in conjunction with cabg 
in january  we received a response from the fda requesting that we either provide more information or modify our labeling request 
since tmr and cabg are each presently utilized to treat separate regions of the heart  we concluded that our present fda approved labeling is adequate  and that the physician can best decide how to use the laser system within the approved labeling 
as a result  in march  we decided that we will not pursue any wording changes to our already approved tmr labeling and have withdrawn our submission to the fda for tmr in conjunction with cabg 
we applied for and received investigational device exemptions  known as ides  to engage in various clinical trials of our ptmr products and procedures 
in december   we submitted a pma application to the fda seeking marketing clearance for ptmr in the united states 
to date  the fda has not granted approval of this application 
the fda may not approve this application in a timely manner  if ever 
the medical community has not broadly adopted our products  and unless our products are broadly adopted  our business will suffer 
our tmr products have not yet achieved broad commercial adoption  and our ptmr products are experimental and have not yet achieved broad clinical adoption 
we cannot predict whether or at what rate and how broadly our products will be adopted by the medical community 
our business would be harmed if our products fail to achieve significant clinical adoption  or our tmr or ptmr laser systems fail to achieve significant market acceptance 
positive endorsements by physicians are essential for clinical adoption of our tmr and ptmr laser systems 
even if the clinical efficacy of tmr and ptmr laser systems is established  physicians may elect not to recommend tmr and ptmr laser systems for any number of reasons 
the reasons why tmr or ptmr laser systems may effectively treat coronary artery disease are not well understood 
although we intend to use research  development and clinical efforts to understand better the physiological effects of tmr and ptmr treatment  we may not achieve such understanding on a timely basis  or at all 
tmr and ptmr laser systems may not be clinically adopted unless we understand thoroughly the physiological effects of the products  and disseminate such understanding within the medical community 
clinical adoption of these products will also depend upon our ability to facilitate training of cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional cardiologists in tmr and ptmr therapy  and willingness of such physicians to adopt and recommend such procedures to their patients 
patient acceptance of the procedure will depend on physician recommendations  the degree of invasiveness  the effectiveness of the procedure  and the rate and severity of complications associated with the procedure as compared to other procedures 
to expand our business  we must establish effective sales  marketing and distribution systems  and we have limited experience to date establishing these operations 
to expand our business  we must establish effective systems to sell  market and distribute products 
to date  we have had limited sales which have consisted primarily of sales of our tmr laser systems on a commercial basis since february  and ptmr laser systems for investigational use only 
with fda approval of our tmr laser system  we are marketing our products primarily through our direct sales force 
we have been expanding our operations by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel 
this has required and will continue to require substantial management efforts and financial resources 
if we are not able to establish effective sales and marketing capabilities our business will suffer 
the expansion of our business may put added pressure on our management and operational infrastructure and could create numerous risks and challenges 
the growth in our business may place a significant strain on our limited personnel  management and other resources 
the evolving growth of our business involves numerous risks and challenges  including the dependence on the growth of the market for our tmr and ptmr systems  domestic and international regulatory developments  rapid technological change  the highly competitive nature of the medical devices industry  and the risk of entering emerging markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  our future operating results will be significantly affected by our ability to successfully and rapidly expand sales to potential customers  implement operating  manufacturing and financial procedures and controls  improve coordination among different operating functions  and continue to attract  train and motivate additional qualified personnel in all areas 
we may not be able to manage these activities and implement these strategies successfully  and any failure to do so could harm our operating results 
our operating results will fluctuate and quarter to quarter comparisons of our results may not indicate future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of events and factors  including the level of product demand and the timing of customer orders  changes in strategy  delays associated with the fda and other regulatory approval processes  personnel changes  the level of international sales  the timing and results of clinical trials  changes in competitive pricing policies  the ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of products on a timely basis  deferrals in customer orders in anticipation of new or enhanced products  product quality problems  and the enactment of health care reform legislation and any changes in third party reimbursement policies 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that our operating results for a future quarter will fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may fall  perhaps substantially 
we may not be able to successfully market our products if we fail to obtain third party reimbursement for the procedures performed with our products 
few individuals are able to pay directly for the costs associated with the use of our products 
in the us  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as medicare  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
a failure by third party payors to provide adequate reimbursement for the tmr and ptmr procedures that use our products would harm our business 
effective july  the health care financing administration commenced medicare coverage for tmr systems for any manufacturer s tmr procedures 
hospitals are now eligible to receive medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures 
the health care financing administration may not approve reimbursement for ptmr  if it does not provide reimbursement  our business will suffer 
we have limited experience to date with the acceptability of our tmr procedures for reimbursement by private insurance and private health plans 
private insurance and private health plans may not approve reimbursement for tmr or ptmr  if they do not provide reimbursement  our business will suffer 
although we do not anticipate receiving medicare reimbursements for our laser systems that are in clinical trials  we will seek reimbursement from other third party payors 
however  such reimbursement may not be available 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment is unnecessary  inappropriate  experimental  used for a non approved indication  or not cost effective 
potential purchasers must determine whether the clinical benefits of our tmr and ptmr laser systems justify the additional cost or the additional effort required to obtain prior authorization or coverage  and the uncertainty of actually obtaining such authorization or coverage 
we face intense competition and competitive products could render our products obsolete 
the market for tmr and ptmr laser systems is intensely competitive and is constantly becoming more competitive 
if our competitors are more effective in developing new products and procedures and marketing existing and future products  our business will suffer 
the market for tmr and ptmr laser systems is characterized by rapid technical innovation 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in developing tmr and ptmr products or procedures that are more effective than our products  are more effectively marketed than our products  or may render our products or technology obsolete 
we compete with plc systems  inc  johnson johnson and boston scientific 
plc is currently selling tmr commercially in the us and abroad  while johnson johnson is currently selling ptmr products for investigational use 
boston scientific has acquired radio frequency technology to begin a percutaneous feasibility trial in the us under a preliminary ide 
earlier entrants in the market in a therapeutic area often obtain and maintain greater market share than later entrants 
plc obtained a pma approval of its tmr laser system in prior to our pma approval and thus  could be able to capture a greater market share 
even with the fda approval for our tmr laser system  we will face competition for market acceptance and market share for that product 
our ability to compete may depend in significant part on the timing of introduction of competitive products into the market  and will be affected by the pace  relative to competitors  at which we are able to develop products  complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes  obtain third party reimbursement acceptance  and supply adequate quantities of the product to the market 
our products also compete with alternative treatment methods and our products must replace these methods to be commercially successful 
many of the medical indications that may be treatable with tmr and ptmr laser systems are currently being treated by drug therapies or surgery and other interventional therapies  including ptca and cabg 
our business would be materially harmed if tmr technology fails to replace or augment existing therapies  or to be more effective  safer or more cost effective than new therapies 
a number of the existing therapies are widely accepted in the medical community  have a long history of use  and continue to be enhanced rapidly 
procedures using tmr and ptmr technology may not be able to replace or augment such established treatments 
clinical research results may not support the use of tmr or ptmr procedures to augment or replace existing treatments 
others are developing new surgical procedures and new drug therapies to treat coronary artery disease 
these new procedures and drug therapies could be more effective  safer or more cost effective than tmr and ptmr laser systems 
the market acceptance and commercial success of our tmr and ptmr laser systems will depend not only upon their safety and effectiveness  but also upon the relative safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments 
our products depend on tmr technology that is rapidly changing  which could require us to incur substantial product development expenditures to respond to industry changes 
tmr and ptmr laser systems are our only products 
accordingly  if we fail to develop and commercialize successfully our tmr and ptmr laser systems  then our business would suffer 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to respond to such changes 
in addition  we must expand the indications and applications for our products by developing and introducing enhanced and new versions of our tmr and ptmr laser systems 
product research and development requires substantial expenditures and is inherently risky 
we may not be able to identify products for which demand exists  or develop products that have the characteristics necessary to treat particular indications 
even if we identify and develop such products  we may not receive regulatory approval and may not be commercially successful 
overall increases in medical costs could adversely affect our business 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led  and will continue to lead  to increased pressures on the health care industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by them 
we can not assure you that in either united states or international markets that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  current reimbursement amounts will not be decreased in the future  or future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to profitably sell our products 
fundamental reforms in the healthcare industry in the united states and europe continue to be considered 
we cannot predict whether or when any healthcare reform proposals will be adopted and what effect such proposals might have on our business 
we have a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future 
we have incurred significant losses since inception 
our revenues and operating income will be constrained until such time  if ever  as we obtain broad commercial adoption of our tmr laser systems by healthcare facilities in the us  until such time  if ever  as we obtain fda and other regulatory approvals for our ptmr laser systems  and for an uncertain period of time after such approvals are obtained 
we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
if we experience increased demand for our products  we may not be able to expand our business to meet such demand 
we may be required to expand our business to respond to increasing clinical adoption of the tmr procedure  develop future products  generally compete successfully  complete the clinical trials that are currently in progress  and prepare additional products for clinical trials  such expansion could place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate such expansion and compete effectively  we must improve information systems  procedures and controls  and expand  train  motivate and manage our employees 
third parties may limit the development and protection of our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our competitive positions 
our success is dependent in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  preserve our trade secrets and proprietary technology  and operate without infringing upon the patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
certain competitors and potential competitors of ours have obtained united states patents covering technology that could be used for certain tmr and ptmr procedures 
we do not know if such competitors  potential competitors or others have filed and hold international patents covering other tmr or ptmr technology 
in addition  international patents may not be interpreted the same as any counterpart united states patents 
in september  one of our competitors sent us a notice of potential infringement of their patent regarding a method for tmr utilizing synchronization of laser pulses to the electrical signals from the heart 
after discussion with patent counsel  we concluded that we did not utilize the process and or apparatus that was the subject of the patent at issue  and we provided a response to the competitor to that effect 
we have not received any additional correspondence from this competitor on these matters 
in  prior to the merger with us  cardiogenesis initiated a suit in the us against plc seeking a judgment that the plc patent is invalid and unenforceable 
in  plc counterclaimed in that suit alleging infringement by cardiogenesis of the plc patent 
also in  plc initiated suit in germany against cardiogenesis and cardiogenesis former german sales agent alleging infringement of a european counterpart to the plc patent 
in  cardiogenesis filed an opposition in the european patent office to a european counterpart to the plc patent  seeking to have the european patent declared invalid 
on january   before trial on the us suit commenced  cardiogenesis and plc settled all litigation between them  both in the us and in germany  with respect to the plc patent and the european patents 
under the settlement and license agreement signed by the parties  cardiogenesis stipulated to the validity of the plc patents and plc granted cardiogenesis a non exclusive worldwide license to the plc patents 
cardiogenesis agreed to pay plc a license fee  and minimum royalties  totaling million over an approximately forty month period  with a running royalty credited against the minimums 
the settlement and license agreement applies only to those products or that technology that uses the plc patents  and the agreement does not provide plc any rights to any cardiogenesis intellectual property 
the eclipse tmr laser system does not use the technology associated with the plc patents 
while we periodically review the scope of our patents and other relevant patents of which we are aware  the question of patent infringement involves complex legal and factual issues 
any conclusion regarding infringement may not be consistent with the resolution of any such issues by a court 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property because patents may not be issued  patents may be challenged  invalidated or designed around by competitors  or patent protection may not continue to be available for surgical methods in the future 
costly litigation may be necessary to protect intellectual property rights 
we may have to engage in time consuming and costly litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation  or interference proceedings declared by the us patent office to determine the priority of inventions 
defending and prosecuting intellectual property suits  us patent office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
we may be required to litigate further to enforce our issued patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or interference proceedings will result in substantial expense  and significant diversion of effort by technical and management personnel 
if the results of such litigation or interference proceedings are adverse to us  then the results may subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  prevent us from selling our products in certain markets or at all  or require us to modify our products 
although patent and intellectual property disputes regarding medical devices are often settled through licensing and similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
this would harm our business 
we rely on patent and trade secret laws  which are complex and may be difficult to enforce 
the validity and breadth of claims in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
issued patent or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent application may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
in addition  patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents 
furthermore  we can not assure you that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products  will not duplicate our products  or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us 
since patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  we cannot be certain that others did not first file applications for inventions covered by our pending patent applications  or we will not infringe any patents that may issue to others on such applications 
the us patent laws were recently amended to exempt physicians  other health care professionals  and affiliated entities from infringement liability for medical and surgical procedures performed on patients 
we are not able to predict if this amendment will materially affect our ability to protect our proprietary methods and procedures 
competitors may independently develop proprietary information substantially equivalent to our proprietary information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
in addition to our patents  we rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we may not be able to meaningfully protect our unpatented technology because our employees  consultants and advisors may breach their confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and there may not be an adequate remedy for such breach  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or competitors may otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
our inability to protect our unpatented intellectual property could materially harm our business 
we depend on single source suppliers for certain key components and production could be interrupted if a key supplier had to be replaced 
we currently purchase certain critical laser and fiber optic components from single sources 
although we have identified alternative suppliers  a lengthy process would be required to qualify them as additional or replacement suppliers 
any significant interruption in the supply of critical materials or components could delay our ability to manufacture our products and could harm our manufacturing operations  business and results of operations 
we anticipate that products will be manufactured based on forecasted demand and will seek to purchase subassemblies and components in anticipation of the actual receipt of purchase orders from customers 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the business practices of each specific supplier and the terms of particular contracts  as well as the overall market demand for such materials and components at any given time 
if the forecasts are inaccurate  we could experience fluctuations in inventory levels  resulting in excess inventory  or shortages of critical components  either of which could cause our business to suffer 
certain of our suppliers could have difficulty expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet our needs if demand for our tmr and ptmr laser systems were to increase rapidly or significantly 
in addition  any defect or malfunction in the laser or other products provided by such suppliers could cause a delay in regulatory approvals or adversely affect product acceptance 
we can not predict if materials obtained from outside suppliers will continue to be available in adequate quantities  or alternative suppliers can be located on a timely basis 
we operate on a purchase order basis with most of our suppliers 
such vendors could at any time determine to cease the supply and production of such components 
we have limited manufacturing experience which could prevent us from successfully increasing capacity in response to market demand 
we have limited experience in manufacturing products 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production  including problems involving production yields  adequate supplies of components  quality control and assurance including failure to comply with good manufacturing practices regulations  international quality standards and other regulatory requirements  and shortages of qualified personnel 
we also may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity  or avoid manufacturing difficulties or product recalls 
our products may contain defects which could delay regulatory approval or market acceptance of our products 
we may experience future product defects  malfunctions  manufacturing difficulties or recalls related to the lasers or other components used in our tmr and ptmr laser systems 
any such occurrence could cause a delay in regulatory approvals or adversely affect the commercial acceptance of our products and could cause harm to our business 
we must comply with fda manufacturing standards or face fines or other penalties including suspension of production 
we are required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices regulations if we market devices in the united states or manufacture finished devices in the united states 
the fda inspects manufacturing facilities on a regular basis to determine compliance 
if we fail to comply with applicable fda or other regulatory requirements  we can be subject to fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  and criminal prosecutions 
we will be able to obtain fda approval only for those products that are proven safe and effective in clinical sites 
the fda has not approved our ptmr laser systems for any indication in the united states 
we submitted a pma supplement for our axcis ptmr system to the fda in december  the ptmr study compares ptmr to conventional medical therapy in patients with no option for other treatment 
the fda may not accept the study as safe and effective  and ptmr may not be approved for commercial use in the united states 
responding to fda requests for additional information could require substantial financial and management resources  and take several years 
we cannot determine if our ptmr laser systems will prove to be safe or effective 
our business would be materially and adversely harmed if our ptmr laser systems does not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials 
we may suffer losses from product liability claims if our products cause harm to patients 
we are exposed to potential product liability claims  and product recalls 
these risks are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
our products are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death  and we could be subject to product liability claims if the use of our tmr or ptmr laser systems is alleged to have caused adverse effects on a patient or such products are believed to be defective 
any regulatory clearance for commercial sale of these products will not remove these risks 
any failure to comply with the fda s good manufacturing practices or other regulations could hurt our ability to defend against product liability lawsuits 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  any such claims could cause our business to suffer 
our insurance may be insufficient to cover product liability claims against us 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate for any future product liability problems  or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we were held liable for a product liability claim or series of claims in excess of our insurance coverage  such liability could harm our business and financial condition 
we maintain insurance against product liability claims in the amount of million per occurrence  and million in the aggregate 
we may require increased product liability coverage as sales of approved products increase and as additional products are commercialized 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we depend heavily on certain key personnel 
our future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel 
our future business and results of operations also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  manufacturing  technical  marketing and sales and support personnel for our operations 
if we lose a key employee or if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position  or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  our business could suffer 
we may engage in future acquisitions that distract our management  cause us to incur debt  or dilute our shareholders 
we may  from time to time  acquire or invest in other complementary businesses  products or technologies 
while there are currently no commitments with respect to any particular acquisition or investment  our management frequently evaluates the strategic opportunities available related to complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the process of integrating an acquired company s business into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment may not be realized 
any future acquisitions or investments by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
we may fail to comply with international regulatory requirements and could be subject to regulatory delays  fines or other penalties 
regulatory requirements in foreign countries for international sales of medical devices often vary from country to country 
the impact of the following factors would harm our business delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  foreign regulatory approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances  or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
our products will be subject to other regulatory requirements in the european union and other countries 
any enforcement action by international regulatory authorities with respect to past or future regulatory noncompliance could cause our business to suffer 
the time required to obtain approval for sale in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
in addition  there may be foreign regulatory barriers other than regulatory approval 
except as stated in the following sentence  the fda must approve exports of devices that require a pma but are not yet approved domestically 
an unapproved device may be exported without prior fda approval to any member country of the european union and the other listed countries  including australia  canada  israel  japan  new zealand  switzerland and south africa if the device is approved for sale by that country  or for investigational use in accordance with the laws of that country 
we received the ce mark for our tmr laser system in december and for our ptmr laser system in july in addition  the vertex tmr probe and the axcis pmr catheter system  acquired in the merger with cardiogenesis  received ce mark approval in july and january  respectively 
in the european economic area  we will be subject to continued supervision  required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities  and required to comply with additional national requirements that are outside the scope of the medical device directive 
we became iso certified in may we may not be able to achieve or maintain the compliance required for ce marking on all or any of our products  and produce our products profitably and in a timely manner while complying with the requirements of the medical device directive and other regulatory requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements we could face fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusals by foreign governments to permit product sales  and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  if existing regulations are changed or new regulations or policies are adopted  we may not be able to obtain  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals or clearances  not be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all  and be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining such foreign regulatory approvals 
we sell our products internationally which subjects it to certain significant risks of transacting business in foreign countries 
our international revenue is subject to the following risks foreign currency fluctuations  economic or political instability  foreign tax laws  shipping delays  various tariffs and trade regulations  restrictions and foreign medical regulations  customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions  and difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our international sales revenues 
in future quarters  international sales could become a significant portion of our revenue 
we may not achieve wide acceptance of our products in foreign markets if we fail to obtain third party reimbursement for the procedures performed with our products 
if we obtain the necessary foreign regulatory registrations or approvals  market acceptance of our products in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country 
they include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
although we expect to seek international reimbursement approvals  any such approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could hurt market acceptance of tmr products in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the week period ended march   the closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  statements by securities analysts regarding us or our industry  conditions or trends in the medical device industry  and changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other medical device companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and our stock price could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of medical device companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management
