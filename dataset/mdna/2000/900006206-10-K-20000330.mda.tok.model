by the end of the first quarter of  the company had substantially developed a us direct sales and european sales infrastructure and marketing programs 
however  the revolutionary nature of the company s technologies  coupled with large restaurant chain operators historical resistance to change and the company s lack of brand strength has limited commercial sales 
the company believes its long term success is dependent on its core competencies of developing new technologies and products for the foodservice and residential appliance industries 
consequently  the company has sought to establish alliances with major corporations with strengths in manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution 
an alliance of this nature was successfully established in september  when the company announced a strategic alliance with maytag corporation maytag alliance to jointly develop new products incorporating the company s technologies 
the maytag alliance entailed a mutual exchange of each company s common stock then valued at approximately million and maytag s payment to turbochef technologies for certain research and development activities related to targeted product initiatives 
the company also announced in july that the maytag alliance had been expanded to establish a cooperative effort to market and sell commercial cooking products in north america 
during the first quarter of  turbochef technologies and gs blodgett corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of maytag  engaging in the manufacturing and selling of commercial foodservice equipment  began arranging for the transition of the manufacturing of the company s commercial unit to blodgett s facilities 
this transition was completed during the second quarter of in november  the maytag alliance was further expanded to include the development of two next generation commercial cooking systems 
the maytag alliance enables the company to focus on its core competency of technology development while utilizing the strengths of well established leaders within the commercial and residential appliance industries to manufacture  market  and distribute the company s products in north america 
the company is currently seeking potential marketing and manufacturing partners in europe and asia to expand the model line up and reach of its technologies 
the company has invested heavily in research  prototype development  strategic alliance development and sales and marketing personnel

as discussed in the accompanying footnotes  the company is currently dependent on a single company  maytag corporation  for its research and development funding and royalty revenues 
in addition  the company is dependent on maytag to manufacture  market and sell its products in north america 
the company is currently pursuing potential marketing and manufacturing partners in europe and asia 
no such partnerships currently exist 
if maytag chooses to cancel the alliance and its related agreements  by giving the company days written notice  the company would not receive additional research and development funding or minimum royalties or have access to maytag s manufacturing  marketing or selling capabilities after the end of the day period 
if revenues from cooking system sales  cash from its financing agreements and external financing is not sufficient  the company may be required to revise its plan of operations  including a curtailment of expansion and product development activities and reduction of other general and administrative expenses 
the company will continue to pursue business growth through implementation of the following strategies i joint development and commercialization of residential and commercial products in north america through the maytag alliance  i joint development and commercialization of residential and commercial products in north america through the maytag alliance  ii pursuit of strategic alliances and license agreements in major international markets  iii continued direct marketing to european restaurants  hotels  convenience stores and other foodservice operators  iv continued development of new hardware  software and food solutions for residential and commercial applications utilizing the company s patented technologies  v the development of new foodservice technologies  and vi the development and execution of an internet and connectivity strategy for both residential and commercial appliances including the filing of key business process patents

liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements in connection with its product and technology development and marketing efforts have been and will continue to be significant 
in addition  capital is required to operate and expand the company s operations 
since its inception  the company has incurred operating losses and has been substantially dependent on loans and capital contributions from its principal stockholders  private placements of its securities and the proceeds from stock offerings 
although the company has historically incurred significant losses  the company expects to generate future cash flows from the direct sale of its commercial cooking systems  royalties from the sale of its commercial and residential cooking systems  license fees for the non exclusive licensing of its technologies  research and development fees for product development and  as necessary and available  raising capital through future equity or debt financing 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company is currently dependent on a single company  maytag corporation  for its research and development funding and royalty revenues

as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings and approximately  in borrowings available through this facility 
at december   the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital of  at december  the  working capital decrease from december  resulted primarily from the decline in value of the company s investment in maytag common stock  partially offset by funds received through the company s long term credit facility with aig and the increased value of the purchased put option recorded in marketable securities available for sale

at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  at december  authoritative pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to report derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company is currently reviewing the standard and its effect on the financial statements 
sfas no 
was amended when the fasb issued sfas no 
 which defers the effective date of this statement until january  forward looking statements although the company has historically incurred significant losses  management believes that it will generate sufficient cash flows for future operations from the direct sale of its commercial cooking systems  royalties from the sale its commercial and residential cooking systems  license fees for the non exclusive licensing of its technologies  research and development fees for product development and  as necessary and available  raising capital through future equity or debt financing 
if revenues from cooking system sales  cash from its financing agreements and external financing is not sufficient  the company may be required to revise its plan of operations  including a curtailment of expansion  product development activities and reduction of other general and administrative expenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that the company would be able to find alternative sources of funding 
any of the aforementioned factors could have a significant adverse effect on the company s current and future operations and financial position 
the company anticipates that it will complete its targeted commercial cooking system research and development in april and  subsequently  will cease receiving the monthly research and development funding payments associated with such projects 
the maytag alliance  however  is ongoing  and provides for the opportunity to establish additional residential and commercial product development projects in the future 
accordingly  future revenues from the maytag alliance will depend upon the establishment of additional fee based research and development projects with maytag and royalties from the successful commercialization and sales of the products that embody the company s technologies 
the company s goals are to continue its development of innovative and commercially viable products  to support the maytag alliance efforts and to establish additional strategic alliances  partnerships and license agreements in major international markets 
the company s future performance will be subject to a number of business factors  including those beyond the company s control  such as economic downturns and evolving industry needs and preferences  as well as to the level of the company s competition and the ability of the company to successfully market its products and effectively monitor and control its costs 
the company believes that increases in revenues sufficient to offset its expenses could be derived from its currently proposed plans within the next to months  if such plans are successfully completed 
these plans include i joint development and commercialization of residential and commercial products in north america through the maytag alliance  ii pursuit of strategic alliances and license agreements in major international markets  iii continued direct marketing to european restaurants  hotels  convenience stores and other foodservice operators  iv continued development of new hardware  software and food solutions for residential and commercial applications utilizing the company s patented technologies  v the development of new foodservice technologies  and vi the development and execution of an internet and connectivity strategy for both residential and commercial appliances including the filing of key business process patents 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement any of the foregoing plans  that either its revenues will increase or its rate of revenue growth will continue or that it will ever be able to achieve profitable operations
