item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of associated banc corp the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
the financial discussion that follows refers to the impact of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section  business combinations  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in particular  in october the corporation merged with first financial corporation ffc  the parent company of a billion federally chartered thrift first financial bank or ffb 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and thus  all consolidated financial data was restated as though the entities had been combined for the periods presented 
in addition  the following discussion will refer to operating earnings  particularly for results 
to arrive at operating earnings  reported results of were adjusted by the following no adjustments were necessary for or 
performance ratios for are also calculated excluding these items 
operating earnings exclude the merger  integration  and other one time charges merger related charges recorded by the corporation in conjunction with the merger of ffc of million  or million after tax 
this pre tax charge includes a million adjustment to securities for other than temporary impairment  million of conforming provision for loan losses  and million of merger  integration  and other one time charges 
these charges reduced basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
performance summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the million earned in basic earnings per share were  a increase over basic earnings per share of

return on average assets and return on average equity were and for  compared to and  respectively  for cash dividends paid in increased by to per share over the per share paid in key factors behind these results were taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  up million or over last year 
taxable equivalent interest income increased by million while interest expense increased million 
the volume of average earning assets increased million to billion  which exceeded the million increase in interest bearing liabilities 
increases in volume and changes in product mix added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  whereas changes in the rate environment resulted in a million decline 
total loans and deposits were billion and billion  respectively  at december   compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  these increases were from internal growth and acquisitions 
provision for loan losses increased to million compared to million in net charge offs increased million  primarily due to lower recoveries in than in  and were of average loans compared to in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans was and at december  and  respectively 
nonperforming assets were million  representing of total assets at year end  compared to million  or of total assets last year 
noninterest income was million for  million or lower than a primary component impacting this decline was mortgage banking income  down million in versus  driven primarily by a drop in secondary mortgage loan production particularly refinancing activity in response to the rising interest rate environment in compared to gains on the sale of assets and investment securities were million lower than the million recorded in excluding mortgage banking income and gains on asset and investment securities sales  noninterest income increased by million or in  with increases in most other categories 
noninterest expense increased million or over most categories of noninterest expense increased due to the acquisitions  which added million 
partially offsetting the increases were decreases in msr amortization and professional fees 
income tax expense decreased to million  down million from the effective tax rate was or bp lower than the rate for  due primarily to the tax benefit of increased municipal securities and boli revenue  and the use of tax loss carryforwards 
business combinations during  the corporation acquired million in assets through three acquisition transactions 
all were accounted for under the purchase method  and therefore the financial position and results of operations of each entity were included in the consolidated financial statements as of the consummation date of each transaction 
due to the timing of the december   purchase acquisition of citizens bankshares  inc citizens  results included citizens financial position in the consolidated balance sheet  but did not include any operational results in the consolidated income statement for the corporation s business combination activity is further summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share repurchase activity is described under section capital 
income statement analysis net interest income net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets eas  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings  used to fund those assets 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of eas and interest bearing liabilities ibls 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on eas and the rate paid for ibls that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average eas 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support eas 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis using a tax rate of 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are presented and discussed below on an fte basis 
table provides average balances of eas and ibls  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on an fte basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
fte net interest income was million for  an increase of million or over a higher level of eas  partially offset by a lower net interest margin  led to the increase in citizens and the acquisitions  net of the cost to fund them  accounted for million of the increase in fte net interest income 
fte interest income increased by million while interest expense increased million 
the volume of average eas increased million which exceeded the million increase in interest bearing liabilities 
increases in volume and changes in mix added million to fte net interest income  whereas changes in the rate environment resulted in a million decline 
see table for rate volume analysis 
for  the yield on eas declined basis points  lowering interest earned by million with loans accounting for million of the decrease  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities fell bp  improving fte net interest income by million with interest bearing deposits accounting for million  for a net decline of million in fte net interest income 
in combination  the growth and composition change of eas contributed an additional million to fte net interest income  while the growth and composition of ibls cost an additional million  netting a million increase to fte net interest income 
the net interest margin was in  compared to in the decline in net interest margin was due to the combination of a lower yield on eas  the reliance on higher cost borrowed funds to support loan growth  and a lower contribution from net free funds 
in addition  the lower margin reflects the cost of funding the corporation s share repurchases during and the purchase of an additional million in bank owned life insurance boli a non interest earning asset 
consistent with industry trends  the corporation s net interest margin has been narrowing 
that trend is a reflection of heightened price competition for traditional loan and deposit products 
recent increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve also pressured the corporation s net interest margin 
average eas were billion in  an increase of million  or  from on average  the acquisitions contributed approximately million to this increase 
loan production accounted for the majority of the growth in eas 
average loans in were billion in  up million or compared to up excluding acquisitions 
during  the corporation focused on shifting the composition of its loan portfolio  especially in growing the proportion of commercial loans  which represented of average eas for compared to for average ibls were billion in  an increase of million  or  from although the corporation has been successful in attracting new noninterest bearing demand deposits  loan growth outpaced deposits  increasing the corporation s reliance on wholesale funding sources 
the mix of ibls shifted from lower rate deposits average interest bearing deposits decreased to represent of average ibls for compared to for  costing or bp less than last year to higher cost wholesale funding  costing bp lower than last year

the acquisitions added a total of million to non personnel related nie categories 
in addition  occupancy expense was impacted by higher costs of contract help and rent  equipment expenses rose due to computer upgrades  and data processing costs increased due to higher processing volumes and expenses associated with year and internet software 
stationery and supplies also experienced increases largely due to acquisition related stationery and office supplies costs 
business development and advertising declined million in compared to as a result of a corporate objective to closely manage these costs

msr amortization which includes the amortization of the msr asset and increases or decreases to the valuation allowance associated with the msr asset is included in other noninterest expense 
msr amortization decreased by million between and  predominantly driven by the valuation adjustment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this decrease was offset by increases in loan expenses especially in credit cards and home equity lines as volume in these lines has grown  office expense  intangible amortization  and losses other than loans 
the acquisitions accounted for million of the increase in other expense

residential real estate loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
residential real estate loans were billion at december   down million or compared to last year 
mortgage loans held for sale decreased by million  to million at year end  a function of a drop in secondary mortgage loan production particularly refinancing activity in response to the rising rate environment in compared to the home equity line grew by million  or  to million in  in response to promotional efforts in other residential real estate loans were down by million 
commercial real estate included in the real estate mortgage classification in table includes loans secured by farmland  multifamily properties  and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over last year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed below for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multi family properties  community purpose properties  and similar properties 
loans are primarily made to borrowers in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in known markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans were billion at the end of  up million or since year end  and comprised of total loans outstanding  up from at the end of acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase since year end the commercial  financial  and agricultural loan classification primarily consists of commercial loans to middle market companies and small businesses 
loans of this type are in a broad range of industries 
the credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operations 
within commercial  financial  and agricultural classification at december   loans to finance agricultural production total million or of total loans 
real estate construction loans grew million or to million  representing of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to million or at the end of loans in this classification are primarily short term interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate  such as multi family or other commercial development projects 
real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are well known to the corporation  have prior successful project experience  and are well capitalized 
projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances

installment loans to individuals totaled million  up million or compared to installment loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans  student loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions on such loans 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
factors that are critical to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   no concentrations existed in the corporation s portfolio in excess of of total loans excluding loans held for sale or million 
allowance for loan losses the investment and loan portfolios are the corporation s primary interest earning assets 
while the investment portfolio is structured with minimum credit exposure to the corporation  the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  thorough review of potential borrowers  and ongoing review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  further ensures appropriate management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses afll was million  compared to million last year 
of this million increase  million of afll was acquired in the purchase acquisitions 
the loan portfolios of the acquired entities were predominantly comprised of commercial loans

ratio of afll to total loans at end of period the afll represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the afll is based on management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  current economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other factors which could affect credit losses  such as year issues related to significant borrowers 
in general  the change in the afll is a function of a number of factors 
first  total loan growth from year end to was up  excluding the purchase acquisitions 
the growth was strongest in the commercial portfolio particularly commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  and construction loans  up net of the purchase acquisitions 
this segment of the loan portfolio carries greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
net charge offs have increased  up million to million for versus million for  primarily from recoveries being million lower than the allocation of the corporation s afll for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the afll  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  and historical losses on each portfolio category 
the indirect risk in the form of off balance sheet unfunded commitments is also taken into consideration 
management continues to target and maintain the afll equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions and emerging systemic factors on the corporation s borrowers 
for both and  estimation methods and assumptions included consideration of year issues on significant customers 
management allocates afll for credit losses by pools of risk 
the business loan commercial real estate  commercial  financial  and agricultural  leases  and real estate construction allocation is based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types  and industries 
the retail loan residential mortgage  home equity  and installment allocation is based on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agencies 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on historical loan loss experience and peer group statistics 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends  and external factors 
the allocation methods used for december  and were generally comparable 
for compared to  the allocation for credit card loans was reduced based on delinquencies and charge offs trending below national averages and the maturation of the portfolio  which indicated lower risk of loss  and the allocation factor for commercial real estate loans included in real estate mortgage was increased given the increased risk associated with a rising interest rate environment on this loan category 
for compared to  increases were made to the afll allocation for credit card and mobile homes based upon a higher risk profile than other consumer loan categories  and increases in commercial categories were made given the growth in these loan segments and consideration of year issues on significant customers 
management believes the afll to be adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the afll may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the afll 
such agencies may require that changes in the afll be recognized when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

net charge offs were million or of average loans for  and were million or of average loans for both and the million increase in net charge offs was primarily driven by recoveries being lower than recoveries 
gross charge offs were down million between and  and gross recoveries were down by million  primarily due to a large recovery on a commercial customer in loans charged off are subject to continuous review and specific efforts are taken to achieve maximum recovery of principal  accrued interest  and related expenses 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is embodied through the ongoing monitoring and reviewing of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that all problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
such past due student loans were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact on the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

at december  and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans account for million of the decrease in nonperforming loans 
commercial nonaccrual loans representing approximately of nonaccrual loans at year end declined million  predominantly due to a million commercial property that was in nonaccrual loans at year end but was moved to other real estate owned in early and subsequently sold before year end the remaining reduction in nonaccrual loans was due to residential mortgage nonaccruals which decreased million compared to the corporation s afll to nonperforming loans was at year end  up from and at year ends and  respectively 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period 
table foregone loan interest years ended december  in thousands interest income in accordance with original terms    interest income recognized    reduction in interest income    potential problem loans are loans where there are doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms 
the decision of management to place loans in this category does not necessarily indicate that the corporation expects losses to occur  but that management recognizes that a higher degree of risk is associated with these performing loans 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry  but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
management does not presently expect significant losses from credits in the potential problem loan category 
other real estate owned oreo decreased to million at december   compared to million and million at year ends and  respectively  predominantly due to the sale of two large commercial oreo properties totaling approximately million 
net gains on sales of oreo were   and  for   and  respectively

mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate issuances  and an increase in the fair value of fixed rate issuances 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase such as seen in the environment compared to  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate issuances  a decline in the fair value of fixed rate issuances  and a decline in fair value of adjustable rate issuances to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security  and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
the mortgage related security portfolio includes both us government agency issuances and nonagency issuances 
unlike us government agency issued mortgage related securities  which include a guarantee of principal and interest payments on the underlying collateral  nonagency securities are generally structured with a senior ownership position and subordinate ownership position s providing credit support for the senior position 
the structure of nonagency mortgage related securities may expose the corporation to credit risk in addition to interest rate risk and prepayment risk as discussed above 
nonagency mortgage related securities afs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management monitors the major factors affecting the performance of nonagency mortgage related securities including  delinquencies  foreclosures  repossessions  and recoveries relative to the underlying mortgage loans collateralizing each security  the level of available subordination or other credit enhancements  the competence of the servicer of the underlying mortgage portfolio  and the rating assigned to each security by independent national rating agencies 
concurrent with the consummation of the ffc merger in  the corporation transferred all nonagency mortgage related securities and an agency security  with a combined amortized cost of million  from securities htm to securities afs 
these mortgage related securities were transferred to maintain the existing interest rate risk position and credit risk policy of the corporation 
concurrent with the transfer in  the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge to earnings relative to one agency security with an amortized cost of million 
management recorded this other than temporary impairment of value in during  the corporation sold approximately one third of the agency security for a million gain 
this security is complex  comprised of multiple cash flows predominated by an inverse floater tied to libor  for which stress tests indicate that the cash flows are volatile in higher interest rate environments 
management continues to monitor and manage the risk exposure of this security 
additionally  in the corporation recorded a million pre tax charge on other mortgage related securities that were transferred to available for sale  with an amortized cost of million  to reflect an other than temporary impairment of value 
these securities were subsequently sold with no additional loss in january in november  the corporation hedged certain agency issued zero coupon bonds held by ffc  with a carrying value of million and a market value of million  by executing various interest rate futures contracts 
these contracts had a notional value of million and would mature in march subsequently  in january  the futures contracts were closed and the zero coupon bonds were sold 
a net gain of million was recognized in investment securities gains in the first quarter of from these transactions 
tax exempt securities grew to represent of total securities based on amortized cost  compared to at year end the steepness of the municipal bond yield curve in  combined with tax advantages  made the tax exempt investments more attractive relative to other similar duration securities 
the aggregate market value of total securities was approximately billion of carrying value and billion of carrying value at december  and  respectively 
at december   the corporation s securities portfolio did not contain securities  other than us treasury and federal agencies  of any single issuer that were payable from and secured by the same source of revenue or taxing authority where the aggregate book value of such securities exceeded of stockholders equity or million

deposits deposits are the corporation s largest source of funds 
at december   deposits were billion  up million or over last year 
the acquisitions increased deposits by million  while the sale of three branches in fourth quarter decreased deposits by million 
thus  without these acquisitions and branch sales  deposits were down from year end the decline in deposits  net of acquisitions and branch sales  was a result of shifting customer preferences  primarily out of certificate of deposit accounts cds  and heightened competition for deposit dollars within the financial services industry 
to curb part of the decline  the corporation increased brokered cds by million to million at december  on average  deposits were billion for  up million or over the average for however  excluding the impact of deposits acquired  total average deposits declined  further excluding the increase in brokered cds  deposits were down 
as previously mentioned under section net interest income  the decline in average deposits increased the corporation s reliance on wholesale funding  as discussed under section other funding sources

long term debt at december   was million  down slightly from million at the end of last year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
short term borrowings are primarily comprised of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  notes payable to banks  and treasury  tax  and loan notes 
of note  the fhlb advances included in short term borrowings are those with original maturities of less than one year and callable notes that have one year call premiums which the corporation expects may be called  even if the notes have maturities exceeding one year 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on short term borrowings 
short term borrowings increased billion to billion at december   compared to last year end  with million of the increase in treasury  tax  and loan notes 
these demand notes represent secured borrowings from the us treasury  collateralized by qualifying securities and loans 
the funds are placed with the subsidiary banks at the discretion of the us treasury and may be called at any time

funds are available from a number of sources  including the securities portfolio  the core deposit base  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
additionally  liquidity is provided from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings with major banks  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to stockholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and represent a primary funding source 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries and affiliates without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
additionally  the parent company had million of established lines of credit with nonaffiliated banks  of which million was outstanding at december  as discussed in item of form k  subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the corporation s stockholders 
during  the parent company and its four largest subsidiary banks were rated by moody s and standard and poor s s p 
these ratings  along with the corporation s existing thomson bankwatch rating  provide opportunity for greater funding capacity and funding alternatives 
the parent company s ratings at december   were prime for moody s short term  a for s p s short term  and bbb for s p s issuer rating 
the subsidiary banks ratings were prime and a for moody s short and long term ratings  respectively  and a and a for s p s short and long term ratings  respectively 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques which measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporate asset liability committee and approved by the corporate board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a basis point immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
the corporation manages interest rate risk through the change in the repricing of investments  interest rate swaps  and purchased funds portfolios 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses two different measurement tools static gap analysis and simulation of earnings 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate now  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan product and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the resulting static gap is the base for the earnings sensitivity calculation 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans  held for sale    investment securities  at amortized cost       loans       other earning assets    total       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing liabilities      total interest bearing liabilities       rate swaps    total interest bearing liabilities with rate swaps       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap    cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and now accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances is considered to be long term and fairly stable and is therefore included in the over year category 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation is used to create a more complete assessment of interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net income for the next month period is compared to the net income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus basis point parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations projected that net income would decrease by approximately of stable rate net income if rates rose by a basis point shock  and projected that net income would increase by approximately if rates fell by a basis point shock 
at december   the basis point shock up was projected to decrease net income by  and the basis point shock down projected that net income would increase by 
the projected changes for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
according to the earnings simulation model  the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate changes increased during in response to higher rates in the second half of  the corporation s sensitivity was increased through the greater reliance on short term borrowings  mitigated in part by the use of interest rate swaps see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors  such as changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action would include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  and changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the primary change in market risk exposure is due to the increase in short term borrowings 
the proceeds from these borrowings were primarily used to fund the increase in loans 
capital stockholders equity at december   increased to million or per share  compared with million or per share at the end of the increase in stockholders equity in was primarily composed of retention of earnings and the exercise of stock options 
offsetting increases to stockholders equity were the payment of cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
issuance of common stock in connection with the purchase acquisitions had minimal impact on shareholders equity at december   due to repurchase activity authorized by the corporation s board of directors bod 
additionally  stockholders equity at year end included a million equity component included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to unrealized losses on securities afs  net of the tax effect  predominately due to the impact of the rising rate impact on that portfolio 
at december   stockholders equity included million related to unrealized gains on securities afs  net of the tax effect 
stockholders equity to assets at december   was  compared to at the end of cash dividends paid in were per share  compared with per share in  an increase of 
cash dividends per share have increased at a compounded rate during the past five years 
the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served  and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios  and tier leverage ratios were in excess of regulatory requirements 
it is management s intent to exceed the minimum requisite capital levels 
capital ratios are included in note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bod has authorized management to repurchase shares of the corporation s common stock each quarter in the market  to be made available for issuance in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
the bod authorized the repurchase of up to  shares per quarter in both and under these authorizations  in  approximately  shares were repurchased  with  shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised 
in   were repurchased and  reissued for options exercised 
in connection with purchase acquisition transactions  the bod authorized the repurchase and retirement of shares issued 
during  approximately  shares were repurchased and  shares were retired in connection with the windsor and riverside purchase acquisitions  with the difference being reissued in connection with the consummation of riverside 
in  approximately  shares were repurchased and  shares were retired in connection with the citizens and windsor acquisitions  with the difference being reissued in connection with the february consummation of windsor 
shares repurchased are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements 
it is management s intent to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return 
fourth quarter results net income for fourth quarter q was million  up million from the million net income earned in the fourth quarter of q 
return on average equity was  up basis points from q  while return on average assets increased basis points to 
acquisition activity further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements impacted the comparable quarter analysis 
financial results of q do not include results of the citizens  windsor  and riverside purchase acquisitions  while q included financial results of all three acquisitions 
these acquisitions account for approximately million  net of funding costs  of the increase in net income between comparable quarters 
the purchase acquisition of bnc on december   impacted only the year end balance sheet 
fte net interest income for q was million  million higher than q the increase was due to growth in average earning assets and higher contribution from net free funds  partially offset by a bp decline in the interest rate spread 
average earning asset growth up billion to billion and a decrease in interest bearing deposits  excluding brokered cds down million  was funded primarily by higher costing brokered cds up million and other wholesale funds up billion 
the net interest margin fell bp to for q the acquisitions  net of funding costs  accounted for million of the increase in fte net interest income between comparable quarters 
the provision for loan losses was up million over the provision for q  in part due to the strong loan growth especially in commercial real estate and other commercial loans 
noninterest income between comparable quarters was impacted by three main components a investment gains were down million  b assets sale gains were up million  primarily due to the gains on sale of three branch locations in q  and c mortgage banking income was down million  the result of an drop in secondary mortgage loan production and refinancing activity between fourth quarter periods caused predominantly by higher interest rates  adversely impacting gains on the sale of mortgages and volume related fees 
without these three components  noninterest income was up million  seen in boli income up million to million in q  given the investment in boli doubled between comparable quarters to million  credit card and other nondeposit fees up million or  and the remainder realized primarily in trust income  retail commission income  and service charges on deposit accounts 
noninterest expense for q was down million over q  led by a million decrease in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights between comparable quarters and a million reduction in legal and professional fees  due to the completion of year consulting and ffc conversion efforts 
partially offsetting these expense reductions were increases in equipment expense up million  primarily in depreciation as computer upgrades were in place and functioning in q versus q  intangible amortization up million  associated with the timing of purchase acquisitions  total personnel expense net of profit sharing expense up million  predominantly in higher fringe benefit costs  and increases to various other line items 
taxes were up million between the fourth quarters  due to the increase in income before tax and the increase in the effective tax rate  at for q compared to for q table selected quarterly financial data the following is selected financial data summarizing the results of operations for each quarter in the years ended december  and quarter ended december september june march in thousands except per share data interest income     interest expense     provision for loan losses     investment securities gains losses  net    income before income tax expense     net income     basic net income per share diluted net income per share basic weighted average shares     diluted weighted average shares     quarter ended december september june march in thousands except per share data interest income     interest expense     provision for loan losses     investment securities gains  net  income before income tax expense     net income     basic net income per share diluted net income per share basic weighted average shares     diluted weighted average shares     compared to the following financial discussion focuses on the comparison of results compared to operating earnings 
in particular  in october the corporation merged with first financial corporation ffc  the parent company of a billion federally chartered thrift first financial bank or ffb 
to arrive at operating earnings  reported results of were adjusted by the following no adjustments were made for operating earnings exclude the merger  integration  and other one time charges merger related charges recorded by the corporation in conjunction with the merger of ffc of million  or million after tax 
this pre tax charge includes a million adjustment to securities for other than temporary impairment  million of conforming provision for loan losses  and million of merger  integration  and other one time charges 
these charges reduced basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the operating net income of million earned in basic earnings per share were  a increase over basic operating earnings per share of 
earnings per diluted share were  a increase over diluted operating earnings per share of 
return on average assets and return on average equity were and for  compared to and  respectively  for key factors behind these results were taxable equivalent net interest income fte net interest income was million in  down  from the million level in the interest rate environment  affected by a flattening yield curve and competitive pricing pressure  negatively impacted net interest income by million  while growth in earning asset volume and changes in mix toward higher yielding loans and toward lower rate funding countered the negative impact from the yield curve shift with a million increase to fte net interest income 
the net interest margin  net taxable equivalent interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for  a basis point decline from in the interest spread  or difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate on ibls  decreased basis points to for  offset by a basis point larger contribution from net free funds 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to  while the rate on ibls decreased basis points to for the sensitivity of the asset mix to the flattening of the yield curve described above was larger than the benefit received from the repricing of liabilities 
the larger contribution from net free funds resulted primarily from a million increase in average balance 
combined  these factors decreased the net interest margin by basis points in the provision for loan losses was essentially unchanged at million for  decreasing  from the million excluding the merger related charge in net charge offs were also unchanged at million  or 
of average loans  for both and the allowance for loan losses to loans increased to from at december  and  respectively 
noninterest income was a strong contributor to earnings  increasing million or over excluding securities gains  noninterest income increased million or 
mortgage banking revenues  trust fees  credit card and related fees  and gains on asset sales accounted for the majority of the increase 
noninterest expense increased million or over personnel expense accounts for of this increase  up million over mortgage servicing rights amortization and professional fees are accountable for million of increase  offset partially by decreases in various other categories  particularly business development and advertising 
subsequent events the corporation continually reviews its branch distribution network for efficiencies and utilization of resources 
in addition to the three branches sold during  the corporation at december   had signed agreements for the sale of deposits of five additional branch locations  totaling approximately million in deposits  with estimated net deposit premiums to be received of approximately million 
the deposit sales are expected to be completed through april the corporation entered into an agreement with citibank usa citi in february under which citi will acquire the corporation s approximately million in credit card receivables 
the corporation expects to recognize a gain of approximately million in the second quarter of as a result of the sale of the credit card receivables 
in addition  the corporation signed a five year agency agreement with citi which includes a revenue sharing arrangement

year the corporation s year project has been completed 
as of february   the corporation has not experienced any significant disruptions of normal business operations 
additionally  no customer disruptions  which could have resulted in significant financial difficulties  have been brought to the attention of management through february  the year project relates to systems designed to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the corporation adopted a centralized approach to addressing the year problem 
the corporation s director of systems and operations has overall responsibility for the year compliance efforts and is assisted by a project management office that is staffed with both internal and external resources 
overseeing the project is a steering committee composed of senior management officials 
monthly status reports have been provided to each of the corporation s affiliates and the corporation s board of directors monitors progress on a quarterly basis 
the corporation dedicated significant internal and external resources to assess  plan  and execute a strategy for achieving year readiness 
using the federal financial institution s examination council ffiec year directives that have been published since  the corporation established policy guidelines and time frames that have been used to manage the work effort and guide year compliance decision making 
all project management activities and plans have incorporated the ffiec guidelines published to date 
the corporation s year compliance efforts have included completing an inventory of all products and services that may be affected by year date related issues 
each product or service inventoried has been categorized as mission critical  significant  ancillary  or other  depending on its significance to the successful continuance of a business activity 
concurrent with and immediately following the completion of the inventory of products and services  the corporation undertook and completed an awareness project involving all employees  management  boards of directors  and customers of the corporation 
the corporation has adhered to ffiec guidelines for substantially completing year remediation  testing  and implementation for all mission critical products and services by june   and for significant products and services by december  the corporation had completed remediation  testing  and implementation for all mission critical and significant products and services by october  the corporation uses national third party service providers and software vendors almost exclusively 
the products and services provided by these organizations have been integrated to provide an overall technology infrastructure for the corporation 
as a result  a large part of the corporation s mission critical product year testing effort was for products processed by service bureaus 
the corporation conducted year testing with these service bureaus and or verified that the service bureau s systems that the corporation utilizes have successfully completed year tests 
the corporation determined not only that the service bureau s systems would function properly in the year and beyond  but also tested that the specific functions utilized by the corporation would properly perform 
the corporation has no custom developed system code 
therefore  the remediation phase of the corporation s year compliance effort did not include code renovation 
product and service upgrades provided by the corporation s service bureaus and other vendors were the primary remediation strategy 
this also impacts the testing phase of the overall project plan and required that it would be proportionally larger than a plan which has significant code renovation as its focus 
the corporation has been careful to consider non information technology as well as information technology systems in its approach to year compliance 
non information technology systems include equipment in use in the business areas  which is not defined as computer hardware or peripheral devices 
equipment includes calculators  time clocks  heating ventilating air conditioning  elevators  telephones  facsimiles  satellite dishes  and security devices 
the corporation contacted vendors of non information technology systems to determine year compliance of these systems and products and tested these systems and products during the corporation also identified third parties with which it has a material relationship  such as telecommunications  power  and other utility vendors 
the impact and status of these services were reviewed and appropriate steps were taken  as considered appropriate in the circumstances  to provide for continued operation for all areas 
the corporation s customers who were not preparing for the year might have experienced a disruption in business that could have potentially resulted in significant financial difficulties 
through the use of personal contacts and questionnaires  the corporation had taken an active role in heightening customer awareness of the year issues  assessing and monitoring material customers year compliance efforts  and taking steps to minimize the corporation s exposure 
material customers include fund takers  fund providers  and capital market and asset management counterparties 
the year readiness of material customers has been monitored by the corporation on a quarterly basis  and prospective material credit customers were also assessed for year compliance as part of the underwriting process 
additionally  consideration of year credit risk had been incorporated into the corporation s loan reserve methodology 
major fund providers were identified and their year readiness had been assessed and monitored 
the costs for year compliance did not have a significant impact on the corporation s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
the corporation s total costs of addressing year issues were approximately million  of which all had been expended as of december  year compliance costs have been influenced by a heavy reliance on external resources that have been contracted to assist the corporation in the project management  vendor management  and testing phases of its year compliance effort 
scheduled systems upgrades and enhancements which would have taken place  notwithstanding the year compliance process  have not been included in the year costs  even though certain of these expenses may have resulted in year solutions 
management of the corporation believes that the potential effects on the corporation s internal operations of the year compliance effort have been addressed prior to the year however  if required product or service upgrades had not been made or were not completed on a timely basis prior to the year  the year issue could have disrupted normal business operations 
additionally  subsequent uncontrolled changes to mission critical and significant products could have impacted their year compliance 
normal business operations could also have been disrupted if third party servicers  upon which the corporation depends for services  including service bureaus  payment systems  utilities  etc  had encountered difficulties relating to the year issue 
the most reasonable likely worst case year scenarios foreseeable at the time included the corporation temporarily not being able to process  in some combination  various types of customer transactions 
this could have affected the ability of the corporation to  among other things  originate new loans  post loan payments  accept deposits or allow immediate withdrawals  and  depending on the amount of time such scenario lasted  could have had a material adverse effect on the corporation 
because of the serious implications of the scenarios mentioned above  a number of actions had been taken to address and or mitigate these risks 
contingency plans had been established and were monitored for all mission critical products to mitigate the risks associated with any failure to successfully complete year compliance renovation  validation  or implementation efforts 
management had also instituted procedures to ensure that those mission critical and significant products tested to be year ready remained so through the turn of the century 
this clean management procedure provided for controlling changes to products deemed year ready and a process for revalidating those products as changes occur prior to the turn of the century
