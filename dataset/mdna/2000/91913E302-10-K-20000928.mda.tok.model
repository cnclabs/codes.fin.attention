valentis actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in this section as well as under item business including risk factors 
overview valentis  inc is a leader in the field of biopharmaceutical delivery 
we develop multiple proprietary gene delivery and gene expression systems and pegylation technologies and apply our preclinical and early clinical development expertise to create novel therapeutics and improved versions of currently marketed biopharmaceuticals 
valentis has what it believes to be the broadest array of technologies and intellectual property for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals  including genes  proteins  peptides  peptidomimetics  antibodies and replicating and non replicating viruses 
this portfolio of delivery technologies potentially allows us to develop new products  create improved versions of currently marketed products and solve safety  efficacy and dosing compliance issues with products in development 
we focus on research  preclinical development and early stage clinical development of products in several therapeutic areas including cardiovascular disorders  oncology  hematology and immunology 
our commercial strategy is to enter into corporate collaborations for full scale clinical development  marketing and sales of products 
valentis itself  or through its polymasc subsidiary  currently has corporate collaborations with roche holdings ltd

valentis has positioned itself to be the near term beneficiary of genomics research  a massive effort underway to understand the sequence and function of the human genome 
the first products being generated from genomics research are biopharmaceuticals such as proteins  antibodies and gene medicines 
we are developing delivery systems that are designed to improve the safety  efficacy and dosing characteristics of these biopharmaceuticals to make them safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop delivery systems for biopharmaceuticals based on two broad technology platforms gene medicines and pegylation technologies 
on march   megabios corp 
completed its merger with genemedicine  inc genemedicine  and on april   the combined company was renamed valentis  inc each outstanding share of genemedicine common stock was converted into of a share of the common stock of valentis 
the merger resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of valentis common stock  valued at million 
the purchase price also included approximately  related to outstanding genemedicine stock options and outstanding warrants assumed by the company and million of transaction costs  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the merger transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
a charge of million for in process research and development acquired from genemedicine was included in valentis consolidated statements of operations see detailed discussion of acquisition of genemedicine research and development programs below 
the intangible assets acquired are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of years 
on august   valentis acquired polymasc pharmaceuticals plc polymasc 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  each outstanding ordinary share of polymasc was exchanged  at a fixed exchange ratio of  for newly issued shares of common stock of valentis 
this resulted in the issuance of approximately million valentis shares valued at about million based on an average valentis stock price of at the date the transaction was announced 
the purchase price also included approximately  of transaction costs  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
dr 
gillian e 
francis  chief executive officer of polymasc  has joined the board of directors of valentis and is serving as managing director of polymasc 
we are managing polymasc as a wholly owned subsidiary of valentis 
polymasc s research and development programs are in various stages of preclinical development 
currently  none of the products utilizing polymasc s proprietary technology has as yet entered any stage of human clinical testing or has been approved for marketing 
polymasc s strategy has been to develop and commercialize its products through alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
a write off of million for in process research and development acquired from polymasc was included in valentis consolidated statements of operations see detailed discussion under acquisition of polymasc research and development programs below 
the intangible assets  consisting of assembled workforce and goodwill  were assigned a value of million and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years 
with the acquisition of london based polymasc  valentis expanded its delivery technologies and has a more diversified portfolio of products in clinical and preclinical development 
the acquisition broadened valentis intellectual property portfolio in biologics delivery  creating what it believes is the first company offering a broad array of technologies and intellectual property in biologics delivery 
polymasc will continue to focus primarily on research and preclinical development of pegylation technologies and products 
pegylation is an established technology that involves the attachment of the polymer polyethyleneglycol peg to therapeutics to alter their pharmacokinetics distribution in the body  metabolism and excretion 
the alteration of the pharmacokinetics of biologics due to pegylation may lead to improved dosing intervals and may also have beneficial effects on safety and efficacy 
we have centers in three locations the woodlands  texas  which houses personnel focused on preclinical research and development  london  england  where polymasc pharmaceuticals plc operates as a wholly owned subsidiary and focuses on polymer based delivery  and burlingame  california  which is the company s headquarters as well as the center for manufacturing and clinical development 
we expect an increase in both research and administrative expenditures in future periods 
to date  substantially all revenue has been generated by collaborative research and development agreements from corporate partners  and no revenue has been generated from product sales 
under the terms of its corporate collaborations  valentis generally receives research and development funding on a quarterly basis in advance of associated research and development costs 
we expect that future revenue will be derived in the short term from research and development agreements and milestone payments and in the long term from royalties on product sales 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of our research and development programs and because we do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect that operating results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of june   valentis accumulated deficit was approximately million 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue valentis revenue was approximately million for the year ended june  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the  and revenue contributions attributable to milestone achievements  collaborative research and development performed under our corporate collaborations  and grant revenues are in thousands year ended june  collaborative research and development revenue roche holdings  ltd   boehringer ingelheim eli lilly   dsm biologics pfizer  other grant revenue total revenue    changes in revenue for the years ended june  and compared to the previous year are explained below revenue from roche increased for the year ended june  because the agreement was acquired through the merger with genemedicine in march the increase was attributable to a full year of revenue recognition for the year ended june  compared to one quarter of recognition for the prior period 
revenue from boehringer ingelheim was recognized under a new month collaboration signed in september revenue and preclinical work under the lilly agreement was completed during revenue decreased because of the completion of substantially all of valentis research obligations under the agreement 
revenue from dsm in was comprised of a  milestone payment 
no milestone revenue or profit sharing has been recognized from products sold through the palliance 
other revenue in resulted primarily from the revenue generated by polymasc  acquired by valentis in august grant revenue decreased due to the completion of sbir grants in in december  pfizer discontinued its research and development program with valentis 
pfizer continued to fund the program through may revenue derived from corporate collaborations and grants may increase in the future if we are successful in establishing new collaborations  and are awarded additional sbir grants 
included in deferred revenue at june   is million related to roche and  related to boehringer ingelheim 
an additional million is expected to be earned under the roche agreement through february the remainder of the deferred revenue will be earned either upon the achievement of certain milestones or under certain circumstances  through the performance of additional contract research 
if valentis continues to meet the milestones for the development of gene medicines under the roche agreement  we may be entitled to payments of up to million 
upon successful completion of phase ii clinical testing  valentis may elect either to receive up to percent of potential profits on worldwide sales by agreeing to share development and commercialization expenses or to receive royalty payments based on worldwide product sales 
expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in and million in the increases were primarily attributable to the additions of staff  facilities and projects resulting from the merger with genemedicine in march and polymasc in august  as well as increased costs associated with additional expenses for clinical trial expenditures 
valentis expects research and development expenses to continue to increase as additional product candidates progress into and through clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to additions of staff and facilities as a result of the acquisition of polymasc 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the additions of staff and facilities from the merger with genemedicine and the costs of producing our first annual report to stockholders 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to increased business development activities and to support expanded research and development activities 
in  valentis recorded million of acquired in process research and development as part of the acquisition of polymasc 
in  million of acquired in process research and development was recorded as part of the merger with genemedicine and the acquisition of rights to the del gene 
details of the mergers and acquisitions are described below 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net was  in  million in and million in the decrease in interest and other income expense  net in compared to resulted primarily from a reduction in the income derived from lower outstanding investment balances and by an increase in property  use and state taxes 
the decrease in interest and other income expense  net in compared to resulted primarily from increased interest expenses on higher outstanding balances on our equipment financing lines of credit 
acquisition of polymasc research and development programs pegylation is the primary polymasc research and development program that valentis acquired in august valentis management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
the program has been valued based on a discounted probable future cash flow analysis using a discount rate of  which management believes adequately reflects the substantial risk of biologics delivery research and development 
in the valuation model  it was assumed that for product candidates based on polymasc s technology  preclinical studies and clinical trials are successfully completed  regulatory approval to market the product candidates is obtained  a marketing partner is secured and we are able to manufacture the product in commercial quantities 
each of these activities is subject to significant risks and uncertainties and no product utilizing the technology has been successfully developed to date 
the pegylation technology that we acquired was valued at million 
polymasc currently has corporate collaborations with onyx pharmaceuticals  transkaryotic technologies  bayer pharmaceuticals  flemington and viragen under which it is developing product candidates using its pegylation technology 
before a product can be successfully marketed  our corporate partners must fund the completion of preclinical studies  clinical studies and  if successfully completed  the market introduction of the new pegylated therapies 
product efficacy and dose responsiveness must be proven in phase ii and phase iii human clinical trials and fda approval is required before market introduction 
we currently estimate that clinical development activities will not be completed and revenues will not begin to accrue to the company for the next several years 
management estimates that the remaining research and development efforts  offset by estimated revenue generated from potential corporate collaborators  will total more than million over the next several years 
this amount could vary significantly depending on the success of preclinical development efforts  clinical trial results  our success in attracting and retaining corporate collaborators and the ability of our collaborators to successfully manufacture and market any resulting products 
acquisition of genemedicine research and development programs there were seven primary genemedicine research and development programs that the company acquired in march prior to the merger of genemedicine with megabios in march  over the previous five years  genemedicine  inc incurred approximately million of research and development expenses in the development of these research and development programs 
costs to complete these projects could aggregate to approximately million over the next four to six years 
at the date of the acquisition  valentis recorded a charge of million for acquired in process research and development 
the nature of the efforts required for developing the acquired in process research and development into technologically feasible and commercially viable products principally relates to the successful performance of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
though the company expects that some of the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  there can be no assurance that commercial or technical viability of these products will be achieved 
while the expectations and promise of gene therapy are great  clinical efficacy has not yet been demonstrated 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing many approaches to gene therapy  but there are currently no marketed gene therapy products and none are expected for the next several years 
in determining its research and development priorities  we decided to delay additional work on three of the programs acquired in the merger with genemedicine 
work on any of the growth factor gene medicines igf  pulmonary gene medicines aat gm and the vaccine programs apc is not expected to be pursued unless or until a corporate partner is identified to provide funding for further development 
as a result of the mergers with genemedicine and polymasc  valentis focus became one of transforming its technologies into products 
at june   valentis had six phase ii clinical trials in progress for four different oncology and cardiovascular gene medicines 
additional three gene medicine product candidates are scheduled to begin clinical trials in the next year 
if these trials and phase iii clinical studies for our gene medicines are successfully completed and our corporate collaborators subsequently market the products  valentis will be entitled to receive royalties on the resulting product sales 
other acquired technology in april  valentis acquired rights and intellectual property related to the del gene and protein from progenitor  inc del is a novel extracellular matrix protein involved in early growth and development of blood vessels and bone that has been demonstrated to have potential application in the treatment of certain vascular diseases by stimulating angiogenesis 
the acquisition of del strengthens our product development in the area of cardiovascular disease 
we expensed the cost paid to progenitor for del of  as acquired in process research and development as the technology was not complete at the date of acquisition 
in march of valentis entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with the university of pittsburgh medical center upmc through which we obtained an exclusive license to certain patent rights held by upmc in the field of viral and non viral gene based therapy for rheumatology 
under the terms of the license and collaboration agreement valentis issued  shares of common stock in payment for the exclusive license to these patent rights 
the value of the common stock issued in the transaction was million  which was expensed as acquired in process research and development during the period 
valentis expensed the value of this common stock  as the technology was not complete at the date of acquisition 
under the terms of the license agreement  we are not obligated to make royalty payments upon the sale of products  if any  in the field of non viral gene therapy  but are required to share revenue with upmc at a specified rate upon the sub license of rights in the field of viral gene therapy 
valentis is obligated to make payments upon the completion of certain milestones 
certain of the license rights may revert back to upmc in the event that we fail to commit resources to the development of products in the field of rheumatology 
in addition  the license and collaboration agreement with upmc established exclusive collaborations between valentis and several researchers at upmc for the research and development of gene based therapies in the field of rheumatology 
intellectual property developed by upmc under the collaboration is included in the exclusive license to valentis described above at no additional cost to us 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   valentis had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments compared to million at june  and million at june  net cash used in our operations was million in  million in and million in cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development and general and administrative activities 
our capital expenditures were  in  million in and million in capital expenditures in and primarily reflect expenditures for the construction of valentis pilot manufacturing facility at its burlingame location 
valentis expects its capital expenditures in the future to at similar levels to those expended in on april   valentis completed a private placement of  shares of newly issued common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in september  valentis completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in october  we entered into an equipment financing agreement with a financing company 
we financed  in equipment purchases under this agreement structured as loans 
the equipment loans are being repaid over months at an interest rate of and are secured by the related equipment 
as of june   the outstanding balance under this financing agreement was  valentis has fully utilized the borrowing capacity under this agreement 
in may  valentis entered into an equipment financing agreement for up to million with a financing company 
we financed million in equipment purchases under this agreement structured as loans 
the equipment loans are to be repaid over months at interest rates ranging from to and are secured by the related equipment 
as of june   the outstanding balance under this financing agreement was  valentis has fully utilized the borrowing capacity under this agreement 
in june  valentis established a line of credit for million with a commercial bank 
in may in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the entire balance was converted into a term loan at the bank s prime rate plus with payments due in equal monthly installments 
at june   the outstanding balance was million 
the loan is secured by tangible personal property  other than the assets securing the equipment financing  accounts receivable and funds on deposit 
as a condition of the credit line  valentis must maintain a minimum cash and short term investments balance of not less than the prior two quarters net cash usage and valentis net worth must remain in excess of of the total principal drawn under the line of credit 
valentis has fully utilized the borrowing capacity under this agreement 
valentis anticipates that its cash  cash equivalents and investments  committed funding from existing corporate collaborations and projected interest income  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through december however  we may require additional funding prior to such time 
valentis future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in its research and development programs  the size and complexity of such programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the ability of valentis to establish and maintain corporate collaborations  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical materials and other factors not within valentis control 
we are seeking additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners and may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
we may not be able to enter into any such agreements  however  or if entered into  any such agreements may not reduce our funding requirements 
we expect that additional equity or debt financing may be required to fund its operations 
additional financing to meet our funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise seek to obtain  which could materially adversely affect valentis business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
financial market risk valentis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations
