year costs the year issue presented a pervasive and complex set of issues in the business environment  as virtually every computer operation within the company could have been affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to 
the issue is whether systems would properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changed to systems that did not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause complete system failures 
with respect to its internal systems  the company continues the process of implementing a multi lingual and multi currency enterprise software at all of ultrak s facilities worldwide 
as of august  the company had successfully completed the conversion process to sap at its worldwide service and support center  as well as four other domestic facilities 
sap s software and all associated third party applications are represented to be year compliant and the company has not experienced any material difficulty or events of failure with sap 
the company s ohio manufacturing facility existing business systems were upgraded as of september  and the company anticipates conversion of the ohio facility to sap by mid in january  the company successfully completed implementation of sap at its austin  texas location

s and exact in europe 
it is expected that the remaining phases of the exact implementation in europe will additionally cost approximately  which will be incurred in such costs are expected to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
following the millenium event on january   the company has not experienced any material or adverse consequences as a result of a year computer error 
based upon the completion of conversions to sap in and anticipated completions in  and discussions with its primary suppliers and vendors  the company does not believe that the year issues will have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs in the future caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in the company s internal systems  which are composed of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software and the company s own software products 
inflation during the years ended december   and  the cost of property and equipment  lease expense and salaries and wages increased modestly

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign exchange the company has foreign based operations  primarily in western europe  which accounted for of net sales 
the company issues intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries denominated in us dollars on a long term basis  exposing the foreign subsidiaries to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates of their local currency relative to the us dollar 
in addition  many of the foreign based operations make sales to customers denominated in different currencies  which carry minimal market risk because the transactions normally settle quickly 
the company does not regularly use forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures 
based on the company s foreign currency exchange rate exposure for intercompany borrowings of approximately million at december   a adverse change in currency rates would reduce accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million 
interest rates the company s credit arrangements expose it to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its revolving line of credit  which provided for interest to be paid quarterly based on a variable rate 
thus  interest rate changes would result in a change in the amount of interest to be paid each quarter 
based upon the interest rates and borrowings at december   a increase in interest rates would adversely affect the company s financial position  annual results of operations  or cash flows by approximately
