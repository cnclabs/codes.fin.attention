item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the business of performing product development and support services on a contract basis for large and small pharmaceutical companies around the world as well as the development of select generic drugs and improved formulations of marketed drugs 
in implementing this strategy  the company earns revenue through fee for service contracts with customers and by licensing and selling internally developed technologies and products 
the product development business utilizes the resources and operating capacity of the nonclinical and clinical groups to study and develop new and improved drugs and drug technologies that improve existing drugs 
the company licenses the developed technologies and products to customers usually before the development is complete 
in general  the company is partially paid for its efforts and innovations at predefined events  known as milestones  which are intended to help cover the costs of development 
the milestone payments are not refundable 
in most cases  the company also receives royalties on the eventual sales of the approved product 
the company bears the risk that some of the development projects may not be approved or that the eventual sales of the product may not meet expectations 
these development projects generally last several years 
the fee for service business consists of two main groups  a nonclinical and a clinical group 
the nonclinical group performs laboratory analysis of various chemical compounds and small scale manufacturing of chemical compounds used for further testing  or in some cases  for sale to the public 
the services performed by the nonclinical group include chemical analysis  chemical synthesis  drug formulation  clinical supply and niche manufacturing  bio analytical studies  and regulatory and compliance consulting 
all of these services involve either laboratory work or consulting services 
the clinical group performs testing of new drugs for customers and the company s own pharmaceutical development program under controlled conditions as part of the customers process in gaining approval for the drug 
all of the clinical services involve contact with patients and monitoring clinical studies performed in hospitals and clinics 
both the nonclinical and clinical groups receive requests for services from a customer  often on a competitive basis 
an estimate of costs to perform the service is delivered to the customer based on the expected resources and materials required to complete the project 
the projects vary in length  some lasting less than one month and others lasting several years  however  most projects may be cancelled by the customer with days notice 
this annual report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially  including  without limitation  the ability to successfully complete scheduled product development projects  continue historic success in entering into beneficial royalty agreements with pharmaceutical companies  obtain timely regulatory approvals of the company s internally developed products  dependence on third party marketing and distribution of internally developed products  the ability of acquired businesses to be integrated with aai s operations  actual operational performance  the ability to hire and retain qualified employees  other regulatory approvals and industry outsourcing trends 
results of operations on march   the company merged with medical technical research associates  inc  mtra a clinical research organization located near boston  massachusetts 
mtra offers clinical phase ii iv studies predominately in the us market to large and small pharmaceutical companies 
the addition of mtra adds clinical phase ii iv capabilities in the united states and will significantly increase aai s ability to provide clinical testing to us customers and enable the company to compete for global clinical trial engagements 
the mtra merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position  and cash flows of mtra as though mtra had always been a part of aai 
results for the years ended december   and represent the combined results of aai and mtra 
compared to net revenues increased by in compared to increases were achieved in both segments  with fee for service revenues up by and product development revenues higher by 
the fee for service increase was due to the inclusion of kcas for an entire year  as opposed to a partial one for excluding kcas  fee for service revenues were down  reflecting capacity underutilization in the second and third quarters as a result of industry wide volume decreases 
the significant increase in product development revenues represents the early benefits of the company s substantial research and development spending in and prior years 
overall  gross margins as a percentage of revenues decreased by to 
fee for service margins decreased by  again due to capacity underutilization in the second and third quarters 
this impact has been somewhat offset at the gross margin level due to the higher mix of product development revenues  with related expenses recorded as research and development 
selling expenses increased by over last year 
in addition  selling expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from to 
these increases reflect the expansion of the company s sales and marketing infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses increased by in  due primarily to a special charge taken in the fourth quarter of million for reserves on certain customer balances  as well as the addition of several senior personnel to the company s management team 
management believes that while dollar levels of selling and administrative spending will increase  the level of spending as a percentage of revenues will decline in future years 
research and development expenses increased by and as a percentage of revenues  from to 
the substantial r d spend is consistent with the company s strategy of long term product development 
in connection with the march merger with mtra  the company recorded a million nonrecurring charge to operating income reflecting the costs to complete the transaction  integrate the businesses and realign its workforce to its new combined operating structure
