item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview miller is an independent oil and gas exploration  development and production company that has developed a base of producing properties and inventory of prospects concentrated primarily in mississippi and montana 
the company was organized in connection with the combination transaction 
the combined assets consist of moc  interests in oil and natural gas properties from the affiliated entities and interests in such properties owned by certain business partners and investors  including ahc  dan a 
hughes  jr 
and sasi minerals company 
no assets other than those in which moc or the affiliated entities had an interest were part of the combined assets 
the company and the owners of the combined assets entered into separate agreements that provided for the issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock and the payment of million net of post closing adjustments in cash to certain participants in the combination transaction in exchange for the combined assets 
the issuance of the shares and the cash payment were completed upon consummation of the company s offering 
the combination transaction closed on february  in connection with the closing of the offering 
the offering  including the sale of an additional  shares of common stock by the company on march  pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after expenses 
for further discussion of the offering and the combination transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
sec regulation s x  rule requires companies reporting on a full cost basis to apply a ceiling test wherein the capitalized costs within the full cost pool  net of deferred income taxes  may not exceed the net present value of the company s proved oil and gas reserves plus the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
any such excess costs should be charged against earnings 
using unescalated period end prices at december   of per mcfe  the company would have recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of approximately million pre tax 
however  on the basis of the improvements in pricing experienced subsequent to period end of per mcfe  the company has determined that a writedown is not required

the results of operations described below will compare historical year end results of operations to pro forma year end results of operations and pro forma year end results of operations to pro forma year end results of operations 
for additional information regarding the combination transaction  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historical year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million of hedging losses gains  respectively see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the sales of the company s antrim shale gas properties in michigan and certain non strategic properties in texas and louisiana that occurred earlier in the combined proceeds from these property sales amounted to million of which million was applied to the company s outstanding debt balance 
the decrease in natural gas production volumes attributable to these sold properties was partially offset by a increase in natural gas produced from the mississippi salt basin properties for the year ended december  compared to the same period of average natural gas prices increased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  due to improved natural gas commodity prices during the third and fourth quarters of despite an increase in oil production volumes for the mississippi salt basin properties  total oil production for the year ended december  declined to mbbls from mbbls for the year ended december  reduced oil production attributable to sold properties in texas and louisiana mentioned above offset the production increases from the mississippi salt basin properties 
average oil prices increased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel for the year ended december  as oil commodity prices rebounded in the third and fourth quarters of lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  lease operating expenses and production taxes decreased due to the combined effect of decreased production associated with the sale of producing properties  as described above  and cost efficiencies realized by the company on its operated mississippi salt basin properties during depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the same period in general and administrative costs started decreasing in due to a cost reduction plan approved by the company s board of directors in march after removal of all non cash items  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  decreased when compared to the same period of general and administrative expense for the year ended december  includes the following non cash items k contributions and director fees which were satisfied with company common stock and compensation expense for the vested portion of restricted stock issued in february  in connection with the initial public offering 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  includes director fees paid in company common stock as a non cash expense 
using unescalated period end prices at december   of per mcfe  the company would have recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in the amount of approximately million pre tax 
however  on the basis of the improvement in pricing experienced subsequent to period end of per mcfe  the company has determined that a writedown is not required 
at december   the company recorded a non cash cost ceiling writedown of million 
the writedown was the combined result of a large downward revision in oil and gas reserve quantities and depressed commodity prices 
disappointing d seismic supported drilling results during and drilling cost overruns on two non operated properties also contributed to the cost ceiling writedown 
the company based its ceiling test determination on a price of per mcfe  which represented the march closing commodity prices 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this substantial interest expense increase is attributable to a higher average debt level in compared to  due to substantial d seismic acquisition costs  and exploration and development activity in the third and fourth quarters of that increased the outstanding debt balance 
also contributing to higher interest expense in was the interest expense associated with the veritas note payable  more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources below and in note  and the prime plus interest rate that became effective with the second amendment to the credit facility agreement dated april   compared to the previous libor based rate effective during net loss for the year ended december  decreased by million to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  include approximately million of hedging gains see risk management activities and derivative transactions below 
production volumes for natural gas during the year ended december  increased to  mmcf from  mmcf for the year ended december  average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf for the year ended december  from per mcf for the year ended december  production volumes for oil during the year ended december  increased to mbbls from mbbls for the year ended december  average oil prices decreased to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel in the year ended december  the oil and gas industry suffered through a year of historically low oil prices in  caused by a global influx of crude oil supply brought on by increased middle east exports combined with a weaker demand from asian markets that were experiencing an economic recession 
the natural gas market also was depressed as a result of abnormally mild winters caused by a strong el nino weather pattern that affected the united states during the past two heating seasons 
the company would have experienced an even larger decrease in revenue had it not been for the natural gas hedging gains of approximately million and the fact that only of total operating revenues for were attributable to oil production 
lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  lease operating expenses and production taxes increased primarily due to increased production as described above and to several workover projects that were completed during the year in an attempt to enhance production during a period of low commodity prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a increase in the depletion rate to per mcfe from 
per mcfe for the year ended december  the higher depletion rate was the combined result of increased production  an increase in costs subject to dd a and a downward revision in estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the same period in the rise in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to added expenses associated with the company s initial year as a public company 
these incremental expenses include legal and professional fees paid to attorneys and accountants  increased rents related to office facilities in mississippi and increased salaries and benefits due to additional financial  technical  operational and administrative staff added during the year 
at december   the company recorded a non cash cost ceiling writedown of million 
the writedown was the combined result of a large downward revision in oil and gas reserve quantities and depressed commodity prices 
disappointing d seismic supported drilling results and drilling cost overruns also contributed to the cost ceiling writedown 
the company based its ceiling test determination on a price of per mcfe  which represents the march closing commodity prices 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december   as a result of increased debt levels in for substantial exploration and development activities in the mississippi salt basin area 
net income loss for the year ended december  decreased by million from to million for the year ended december   as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of capital have been funds generated by operations  and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
the company has a credit facility the credit facility with bank of montreal  houston agency bmo 
the credit facility includes certain negative covenants that impose limitations on the company and its subsidiary with respect to  among other things  distributions with respect to its capital stock  limitations on financial ratios  the creation or incurrence of liens  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  making loans and investments and mergers and consolidations 
the obligations of the company under the credit facility are secured by a lien on all real and personal property of the company 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
on april   the company and bmo entered into the second amendment to the credit facility 
the second amendment stipulated  among other things  that the company submit a revised reserve report to bmo by october  for a re determination of the borrowing base and pay a  re determination fee 
on october   the re determination fee was paid  and the company and bmo entered into the third amendment to the credit facility which included i terms requiring the company to make principal payments to bmo during the period beginning with october through february  ii terms requiring that all outstanding borrowings bear interest at bmo s prime rate plus  iii revision or waiver of certain negative covenant provisions through september   iv a requirement to submit a revised reserve report to bmo by april  for a re determination of the borrowing base  v a requirement that all proceeds from the sales of proved or unproved oil and gas properties  prior to the re determination date  must be used to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the credit facility  and vi a requirement for an amendment fee payable to bmo in an amount equal to of the outstanding balance of the credit facility at the april re determination date 
final maturity of the credit facility was set at january  total principal payments of million were made under the third amendment with the remaining million waived through letter agreements subsequent to december  on march   the company entered into a fourth amendment with bmo which continued all of the provisions of the third amendment with the exception of the following changes i extension of the final maturity date of the credit facility to april   and ii requirement of a million principal payment by march  at the april re determination date  the company may be required to make additional payments of principal to the extent its outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base 
to the extent that additional payments are required  management believes these would be fulfilled from available cash flows  and would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
on april   the company issued a million note payable to one its suppliers  veritas dgc land  inc the veritas note payable  for the outstanding balance due to veritas for past services provided in and the balance due veritas was million at december   and has been classified as long term debt in the accompanying financial statements 
the principal obligation under the veritas note payable is due on april  management plans to fulfill the principal obligation under the veritas note payable from available cash flows  property sales and other financing sources 
on april   the company also entered into an agreement the warrant agreement to issue warrants to veritas that entitle veritas to purchase shares of the company s common stock in lieu of receiving cash payments for the accrued interest obligations under the veritas note payable 
the warrant agreement requires the company to issue warrants to veritas in conjunction with the signing of the warrant agreement  as well as on the six and  at the company s option  and month anniversaries of the warrant agreement 
the warrants to be issued must equal of the then current outstanding principal balance of the veritas note payable 
the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants issued on april   and on the six month anniversary was determined based upon a five day weighted average closing price of the company s common stock at april  the exercise price of each warrant is per share 
on april   warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock were issued to veritas in connection with execution of the veritas note payable 
on october   the six month anniversary of the warrant agreement  warrants exercisable for another  shares of common stock were issued to veritas 
the company has the option  in lieu of issuing warrants  to make a cash payment to veritas at the and month anniversaries equivalent to of the then current principal balance of the veritas note payable 
the number of shares to be issued on the and month anniversaries will be based upon a five day weighted average closing price of the company s common stock at april  under the terms of the warrant agreement  all warrants issued will expire on april  in addition  the company also entered into an agreement with veritas that i requires the company to file a registration statement with the sec to register shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of the above warrants and ii grants certain piggy back registration rights in connection with the warrants 
in connection with the closing of the ahc acquisition on february   the company has a non interest bearing note payable to ahc the ahc note payable of million at december  which is payable on the annual anniversary dates of the closing as follows million in and million in the company has obtained a day extension of the million payment from february to april at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million excluding the current portion of long term debt 
management plans to meet these working capital requirements from available cash flows  property sales and other financing sources 
the company has budgeted capital expenditures of approximately an unrisked million for capital expenditures will be used to fund drilling and development activities  the shooting of a new d seismic survey and leasehold acquisitions and extensions in the company s project areas 
the actual amounts of capital expenditures and number of wells drilled may differ significantly from such estimates 
actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  were approximately million 
the company intends to fund its budgeted capital expenditures through operational cash flow 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  substantially are dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
the company cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
a return to the significantly lower oil and gas prices experienced in and early  as compared to historical averages  would likely have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements primarily due to the company s active exploration and development program 
while the company believes that cash flow from operations and improved commodity prices should allow the company to implement its present business strategy through  additional debt or equity financing may be required during the remainder of and in the future to fund the company s growth  development and exploration program  and to satisfy its existing obligations 
the failure to obtain and exploit such capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company  including further curtailment of its exploration and other activities 
risk management activities and derivative transactions the company uses a variety of derivative instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
to qualify for hedge accounting  derivatives must meet the following criteria i the item to be hedged exposes the company to price or interest rate risk  and ii the derivative reduces that exposure and is designated as a hedge 
commodity price hedges in  the company began using certain derivatives eg  nymex futures contracts for a portion of its oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce the exposure to price fluctuations 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit potential gains from future increases in prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  the company s customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
for financial reporting purposes  gains and losses related to hedging are recognized as oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged transactions occur 
the company expects that the amount of hedge contracts that it has in place will vary from time to time 
the company s hedging strategy is to maximize its return on investment through hedging a portion of its activities relating to oil and natural gas price volatility 
while this strategy should help the company reduce its exposure to price risks  it also limits the company s potential gains from increases in market prices for natural gas 
the company intends to continue to hedge up to of its oil and natural gas production to retain a portion of the potential for greater upside from increases in natural gas prices  while limiting to some extent the company s exposure to declines in natural gas prices 
for the year ended december   the company had hedged of its oil and natural gas production  and as of december   the company had bcfe of open oil and natural gas contracts for the months of january through march interest rate hedge the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  effective november   to exchange the variable rate interest payment obligation under the credit facility without exchanging the underlying principal amount 
this agreement converts the variable rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the exposure to credit loss 
the notional amount of the company s interest rate swap was million at december   and had a fair value of approximately million 
during march  the company terminated its interest rate swap agreement and received million  which is being recognized in earnings ratably as the related outstanding loan balance is amortized 
market risk information the market risk inherent in the company s derivatives is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the prices of oil and natural gas are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by the market fluctuations  the company s policy is to hedge through the use of derivatives future production 
because commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company sells in the physical market  no special correlation studies other than monitoring the degree of convergence between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
the changes in market value of these derivatives have a high correlation to the price changes of oil and natural gas 
a sensitivity analysis model was used to calculate the fair values of the company s derivatives rates in effect at december  the sensitivity analysis involved increasing or decreasing the forward rates by a hypothetical and calculating the resulting unfavorable change in the fair values of the derivatives 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  showed this type of change would not have a material impact on the fair value of the derivatives 
effects of inflation and changes in price crude oil and natural gas commodity prices have been volatile and unpredictable during and  with crude oil prices falling below per bbl and rising close to per bbl  and natural gas prices dropping below per mcf and then climbing up above per mcf during this two year time period 
these wide fluctuations have had a significant impact on the company s results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
recent rates of inflation have had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed thereby frequently change and become subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity 
year readiness disclosure the company has completed its year readiness plan year plan which focused on the company s computer systems and any embedded computer chips integrated into company operated oil and gas production related equipment 
implementation of the year plan included an assessment and complete inventory of computer hardware software systems plus oil and gas production equipment 
the company identified  remediated and tested those critical systems that were not year compliant to prevent any business disruption 
the company expensed the cost of software upgrades as incurred and utilized company personnel to execute the various phases of the year plan 
the total costs to implement the year plan was less than  and did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any year related matters to develop subsequent to the year end  but the company will continue to monitor its systems for any such developments 
new accounting standard in  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements and has not determined the timing of or method of its adoption of sfas no 
however  sfas no
