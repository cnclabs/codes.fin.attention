quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not currently participate in any significant hedging activities  nor does it utilize any significant derivative financial instruments 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the company s market risks 
interest rates 
the company s commercial paper  notes payable  fixed rate notes  and other long term debt are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
these fluctuations expose the company to changes in interest expense  cash flows  and the fair market value of the instruments 
the company s variable rate debt amounted to million at august  based on outstanding borrowings at year end  a percent adverse change in effective market interest rates at august  would result in additional annual after tax interest expense of approximately million 
although a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the company s million publicly traded notes  a percent adverse change in effective market interest rates at august  would decrease the fair value of the notes to approximately million 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of the company s revenue  expense  and capital purchases are transacted in us dollars 
international operations  primarily of the lighting equipment and chemical segments  represented less than percent of sales and service revenues  operating profit loss  and long lived assets 
the company does not believe a percent fluctuation in average foreign currency rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements or results of operations
