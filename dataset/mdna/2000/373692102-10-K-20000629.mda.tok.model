item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations net revenues our net revenues in fiscal year increased  or  versus net revenues in fiscal year we attribute the increase to increased professional services revenues and license revenues which more than offset reductions in research and development fees 
the shift in revenues to professional services from research and development fees is consistent with our shift of focus to becoming a mobile e commerce and information services provider 
in addition  we receive license revenues based on our technology included in smartphones  our wireless internet server and various software and operating systems 
professional services revenue increased  or  in the year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we changed the nature of our contractual arrangements for engineering services provided and increased growth in the volume of engineering consulting services provided to our customers 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began providing a portion of our non recurring engineering services on a professional services consulting basis rather than as original equipment manufacturer oem funded research and development 
such consulting services can be offered at relatively higher rates  but do not generally have the additional revenue potential provided by a product royalty agreement with the oem 
we are fulfilling contracts in this manner because we are providing engineering services on different types of projects and because we believe there are greater relative returns in consulting opportunities compared to performing oem funded research for lesser rates  and taking on related risks inherent in collecting product royalty revenues based on potential shipments of resulting products by the oem 
professional services revenues are generally billed and recognized based on time and materials expended rather than based on the attainment of milestones specific to the oem contracts 
our professional service projects involve consulting related to technology previously developed by us  as well as development of new technologies supporting mobile communications 
during the fiscal year we extended our agreement with nokia to provide professional technology services and develop application software for mobile phones  and we began collaborating with sonera smarttrust in developing wireless e commerce applications 
we also continue to provide operating system development and multi media device development services to mitsubishi electric corporation 
the professional services revenues ultimately recognized depend upon our ability to hire and maintain the engineering staff and resources necessary to meet our customers desired scope of work as well as our ability to attract additional customers for these services 
our consulting relationship with sonera smarttrust will wind down in the first quarter of fiscal year as the current project reaches completion 
research and development fees revenue decreased  or  in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the revenues recognized in the latest fiscal year resulted from contracts that had been in progress since fiscal we no longer have any active contracts of this nature 
as discussed above  our business model has changed and oem funded research and development contracts are not being actively pursued 
research and development fees represent reimbursement for a portion of our development costs related to specific products up to the amounts specified in our oem licensee contracts 
the oem licensee typically pays us as certain project milestones are achieved 
revenue under these research and development arrangements is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
the amount of such revenue can vary considerably among periods  depending upon the specific terms of our contracts with oem licensees and the relative level of development effort devoted to projects in which research and development fees are charged 
license and other revenue increased  or in the year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
such revenues include royalty and license fees resulting from the use of our technology in units sold by oem customers as well as sales of our source code and various service revenues 
royalty and license fees increased by million to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year  primarily due to royalties received based on increased shipments of units sold by a single oem licensee 
this increase was partially offset because during fiscal year  the termination of a license agreement with another oem customer had resulted in revenue of million  but no transactions of this nature were recorded in the year ended march  source code revenues increased  to million in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior year 
the termination agreement and source code fees discussed above were one time events based on the elements and circumstances of particular contracts and as such are not expected to be recurring 
service revenues decreased  to  in the year ended march  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in support fees earned in connection with software licensed to oem customers 
this decrease is consistent with the change in our business model discussed above 
although royalty revenues increased in the most recent fiscal year  because we have sold certain source code outright and terminated a number of license agreements during recent years  the number of oems subject to license agreements which could generate future royalty revenues has decreased 
during the current fiscal year we entered into new agreements to license our wireless internet server technology and to license certain operating system technologies  however we cannot assure you that the resulting revenues  or those from our program to license our technology used in the wap specification  will replace or be greater than the license revenues historically generated from our oem customers 
as discussed above  license and other revenue has historically included non recurring items such as one time source code license fees  or fees received due to changes in the terms of license agreements resulting from amendment  restructuring  or termination of these agreements 
such revenues are non recurring and are therefore not indicative of revenues to be recognized in future periods 
further  our realization of anticipated license and royalty revenue from oem customers is inherently uncertain due to potential delays and risks in the commercial release and acceptance of new products 
net revenues decreased  or  in fiscal year compared to net revenues in fiscal year the primary continuing revenue categories  research and development fees and license and other revenue declined in fiscal year relative to the preceding fiscal year 
new revenues from professional services partially offset these decreases 
professional services revenues were  in the year ended march  as discussed above  we began providing some of our non recurring engineering services on a consulting basis rather than as oem funded research and development in the second quarter of fiscal year such consulting services can be offered at relatively higher rates  but do not generally have the additional revenue potential provided by a product royalty or license agreement with the oem 
research and development fees revenue decreased  or  in fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal year this substantial decrease occurred because we completed development work on several major oem projects 
despite our success in developing mobile communication device operating systems for several major oems  because of the slower than anticipated development of the smartphone market and the june announcement of the symbian joint venture psion  ericsson  motorola and nokia formed to license and further develop a competing operating system platform  there were fewer opportunities for us to provide such research and development services 
as work on our existing projects concluded  we assigned development staff to smaller projects with reduced staffing requirements  some of which had lower reimbursement rates 
these reductions in contract requirements resulted in staffing reductions achieved through attrition and restructure directives 
additionally  we settled a contract dispute with an oem customer during fiscal and under the percentage of completion method  the effect of this settlement was to lower our revenue and the corresponding accounts receivable in fiscal year by  license and other revenue decreased  or  in fiscal year ended march  in comparison to fiscal year we recognized license revenue from four primary types of transactions in each period 
during fiscal  revenues from the restructure or termination of license agreements totaled  as compared to  during the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal year this revenue resulted from an agreement with a single oem customer while agreements with three different oem customers were restructured or terminated in fiscal year at the time of these agreements  we either agreed to accept one time settlement payments in lieu of our right to all or a portion of future royalties or we were able to recognize the non refundable portion of prepaid royalty deposits we had already received 
during fiscal  revenues from the sale of source code developed by us were  as compared to  for the previous fiscal year 
royalties  and to a lesser extent  technology license fees  resulting from the use of our technology in units sold by our oem customers decreased to  in fiscal year as compared to  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the restructure and termination agreements discussed above which changed the terms of our compensation agreements with those oem customers 
service revenues   and  in fiscal years and  respectively  decreased due to reduced support fees earned in connection with software licensed to oem customers 
operating expenses cost of services 
cost of services are those expenses incurred to provide professional services consulting  including compensation  travel  related direct costs and facilities overhead 
in general  the employees providing these services had previously been engaged in fulfilling our obligations under oem research and development contracts 
cost of services increased  or in fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross margin percentages on professional services revenues were and in the years ended march  and  respectively 
costs of services expenses and the related gross margin dollars were significantly greater in the year ended march  because we offered and provided professional services under consulting agreements for the entire year 
we began to offer our professional engineering services in this manner in the second quarter of fiscal year the gross margin recognized on such services is may vary depending on the average rates charged for these consulting services  our ability to hire and retain engineering personnel at competitive rates  and the utilization rates of these personnel 
since we have a limited history in providing such services  the gross margin percentages achieved to date are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenues consists of license payments to third parties for software that is incorporated into our software 
cost of license revenues increased to  in fiscal year ended march   as compared to  and  in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
license payments increased in fiscal year due to the increased volume of royalty revenue recognized as compared to the prior years 
gross margin percentages on license and other revenue were  and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
gross margin percentage was reduced in fiscal year because a greater proportion of the license and other revenues were subject to third party software license agreements 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased  or  during fiscal year ended march  in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due primarily to increased spending on marketing and advertising programs in support of our mobile attitude and mobile asp offerings as well as increased business development activities 
these increased program costs were partially offset by reduced personnel costs 
although our sales and marketing staff was now larger at fiscal year end than at the end of the prior fiscal year  average sales and marketing headcount was approximately less in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
sales and marketing expense decreased  or  during fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year in fiscal year we narrowed the scope of our product plans and marketing activities and therefore reduced our staffing and achieved certain other cost reductions in our sales and marketing programs 
additionally  there had been a non recurring charge of approximately  during fiscal year in connection with a reorganization of staff in certain sales and marketing functions 
research and development 
research and development expense decreased  or  during fiscal year ended march  in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this decrease principally to reductions in staffing and related costs  including those resulting from the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal such staff and expense reductions were necessary as we stopped doing operating system development and reacted to reduced levels of oem funding 
we have also narrowed the scope of our internal research and development to focus on our mobile e commerce and information services business 
although the research and development staff grew by during the quarter ended march   average headcount for fiscal year was approximately less than in the prior fiscal year 
approximately of the reduction in research and development headcount is due to the shift of staff into professional services consulting 
research and development expense decreased  or  during fiscal year in comparison to fiscal year as in fiscal year  this decrease was attributable principally to reductions in staffing and related costs 
reductions in contract requirements resulted in staffing reductions achieved through attrition and the restructure directives 
staff reductions first became significant in the quarter ended september  as a result  we also narrowed the scope of our internal research and development activities and reduced amounts paid to outside developers for services and the license of software to be incorporated into future products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased  or during the fiscal year ended march  in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due primarily to reduced staffing costs and reduced professional fees consistent with the reductions in staffing and activity in other areas due to the restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the change in our business focus 
although professional fees decreased  legal expenses related to our intellectual property licensing program increased versus prior years and are expected to continue to increase as a result of the filing of a lawsuit by phone 
com challenging the validity and enforceability of our flex ui patent 
see further discussion at item legal proceedings and risk factors affecting future operating results  ability to capitalize on intellectual property rights and patent portfolio 
general and administrative expense increased  or  during fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year these expenses were essentially flat for the year as increased professional fees were offset by decreases in a number of other expenses 
restructuring charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of  as a result of actions taken to better align our cost structure with revenue projections as we shifted our resources to support a business plan focused on opportunities in the mobile e commerce and information services market 
during this quarter  we reduced our workforce by  vacated one facility and consolidated those operations in a remaining facility  which was also partially vacant 
the restructure charges consisted of  in severance costs  charges of  for the write off of fixed assets  and  for the accrual of lease commitment liabilities net of expected sublease income as a result of these actions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we negotiated a release from the remainder of the lease of the facility previously vacated in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we had not been able to arrange for a sublease of the excess space in our primary facility  based on improved operating results and improved business opportunities  we now intend to fully occupy this space 
we did not utilize this excess space in fiscal as a result of these actions  the remaining lease commitment accrual of  was reversed 
other income expense other income 
the proceeds from sales of approximately of our shares of common stock of wink communications  inc wink resulted in other income of  in the year ended march  these were the first shares liquidated by us since wink completed its initial public offering in august no such transactions were completed in the prior fiscal years 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  our strategy for liquidating all or some portion of our long term investments will depend on a number of factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the levels of cash we use in operations  the desire to diversify our investment risk  and the performance of these investments versus the stock market as a whole 
interest income 
interest income increased  or in the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to the increased balances of cash available for short term investment 
net cash used in operations was significantly reduced due to improved operating performance and we generated million from the sales of wink stock discussed above 
we also received million from the issuance of common stock in fiscal year in addition to the million raised in a private placement from amazon 
com in the fourth quarter of fiscal year interest income declined  or  during fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year this decrease was attributable to reduced balances available to us for short term investment as result of the cash used to fund our operations during each year 
interest expense 
interest expense was not significant in the fiscal years ended march  or the prior fiscal year because we had only minimal levels of capital lease and debt obligation liabilities outstanding in these periods 
interest expense decreased  or  during fiscal year in comparison with fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to reduced debt outstanding as a result of regularly scheduled payments of capital lease obligations outstanding 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

income tax expense consists of foreign income tax withholding on foreign source royalties paid us 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us income tax purposes of approximately  and for uk income tax purposes of approximately  and for state income tax purposes of approximately  we also had research and development credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  and for state income tax purposes of approximately  utilization of our us net operating loss and research credit carryforwards will be subject to annual limitations based on the change of ownership provisions of the tax reform act of these limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and research credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources our current sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling million at march  this balance has increased from million at march  and decreased from million at march  this balance has increased at march  as compared to the prior year end because we used significantly less net cash in operating activities  generated cash from our working capital accounts  collected over million from the sales of wink stock and collected over million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock during fiscal year our net loss was significantly reduced as compared to the prior two years due to reduced operating deficits and the other income recognized on the sale of a portion of our investment in wink 
operating deficits were reduced due to the increased revenues discussed above and actions we took to better align our cost structure with revenue projections  including restructuring moves made in the quarter ended march  cash and marketable securities had decreased over the past two years primarily due to the operational deficits we incurred 
additional sources of liquidity available to us include our long term investments in two publicly held companies wink communications  inc wink and myturn 
com mytn 
wink completed its initial public offering of its common stock in august and as result we recorded the fair value of our shares in our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of this investment will fluctuate with the market price of wink common shares 
this investment had a fair value of million and million as of march  and june   respectively 
in addition  in december  we received warrants to purchase  shares of myturn 
com in connection with a license agreement 
the exercise price per share is 
the warrants are exercisable beginning in april and expire in december we have the right to have these shares included in registration statements filed on behalf of mytn and to require mytn to file such a registration statement  subject to certain restrictions  beginning may  the fair value of this investment will fluctuate with the market price of mytn common shares 
the fair value of our investment in mytn million and million as of march  and june   respectively is included in long term investments 
our strategy for liquidating all or some portion of the wink and mytn investments will depend on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the levels of cash used in our operations  our desire to diversify investment risk  and the performance of wink and mytn stock versus the stock market as a whole 
purchases of property and equipment were   and  in the fiscal years   and  respectively 
we have started to increase capital spending to meet our operating objectives and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
capital expenditures in the prior year were not significant  consistent with reductions in personnel resulting from restructuring moves and reduced levels of oem funded research and development activities 
sales of property and equipment were  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
such sales were done to generate cash from excess property and equipment 
payments of capital lease and debt obligations were   and  in fiscal years  and respectively  primarily due to regularly scheduled payments of the related liabilities incurred prior to fiscal year in fiscal year these payments included  to retire the debt outstanding on the property we sold 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock were approximately million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
a private placement with amazon 
com provided cash of million in fiscal year the remainder of the proceeds have been generated from our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we expect to increase our investment in the development of our mobile e commerce and information services business  including additional sales  marketing and research and development spending  and we expect to incur additional operating losses at least through the next fiscal year ending march  although we anticipate that our existing cash and capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funding in that time frame or that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on acceptable terms

foreign exchange rate we have derived most of our revenue from international operations in each of the last three fiscal years 
although our invoices to customers are generally denominated in us dollars  our international subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our cash accounts in foreign countries are kept at minimal levels necessary for operations 
as the result of the above  the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and as these exchange rates vary  the subsidiaries results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact our results of operations
