item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company provides integrated facility development  design  construction and operational services to governmental agencies within three operating divisions i secure institutional correctional and detention services  ii juvenile treatment  educational and detention services and iii pre release correctional and treatment services 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total service capacity  the service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown and the average occupancy percentages 
year ended december  total service capacity residential    non residential community based   total    service capacity in operation end of period    contracted beds in operation end of period    average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation average occupancy excluding start up operations occupancy percentages are based on contracted service capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have service capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from operating correctional  detention  pre release and treatment facilities for federal  state and local governmental agencies in the united states 
revenues for operation of correctional  detention  pre release and treatment facilities are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period or cost plus reimbursement 
factors which the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include i the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  ii wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  iii whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and iv the anticipated average occupancy levels which the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
the company s operating margins generally vary from facility to facility regardless of whether the facility is secure institutional  juvenile or pre release based on the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility and the anticipated changes in operating costs  if any  over the term of the contract 
the company is responsible for all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract nine facilities in operation at december a majority of the company s facility operating expenses consist of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating expenses increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating expenses  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating expense  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust the staffing and payroll to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  but a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
pre opening and start up expenses consist primarily of payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during a period of approximately three months of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
in january  the company adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  or sop  and recorded a net of tax charge of approximately million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as a result of the company s adoption of sop  the company began to expense pre opening and start up costs as incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll  information systems and other services and costs of business development 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders 
offenders are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to three month period 
the company may incur start up operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
results of operations the company s historical operating results reflect a significant expansion of the company s business since material fluctuations in the company s results of operations are principally the result of the timing and effect of acquisitions  the level of development activity conducted by the company  and occupancy rates at company operated facilities 
the company s acquisitions to date have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the operating results of the acquired businesses have been reported in the company s operating results since the date of acquisition 
the company s income from operations as a percentage of revenues fluctuates depending on the relative mix of operating contracts among the company s three operating divisions 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentages of revenues represented by certain items in the company s historical consolidated statements of operations

new facilities and projects under construction 
the new morgan academy is currently under construction and is expected to be completed and operational during the fourth quarter of in april  the company was awarded a contract to design  build and operate a  bed prison for the fbop in moshannon valley  pennsylvania moshannon valley correctional center and immediately commenced construction and activation activities 
in june  the fbop issued a stop work order pending a re evaluation of their environmental documentation supporting the decision to award the contract 
the environmental study was completed with a finding of no significant impact 
while the stop work order is still in effect  management of the company believes it will be lifted and construction will be resumed in the near term 
development and construction costs for the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center are being financed with the company s lease financing arrangement discussed below under long term credit facilities 
in june  the company was selected by the state of utah to design  build  finance and operate a bed prison 
the company is currently involved in contract negotiations for the project 
based on these contract negotiations  management believes that this contract will ultimately be for management services only and the company will not be financing the facility s construction costs 
as of march   there were approximately million in anticipated unfunded capital requirements for the completion of the new morgan academy and the moshannon valley correctional center 
the funds for these new facilities and related furnishings are expected to be expended during the next to months 
the company s lease financing arrangement is available to fund up to approximately million of these construction costs 
management believes that the remaining facility construction costs will be funded with an increase in the company s lease financing arrangement 
working capital deficit 
at december   the company reported a working capital deficit of million 
excluding the million of borrowings outstanding under the company s subordinated bridge loan agreement bridge facility  which matures in october  the company had working capital of million 
short term credit facilities 
as of december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the company s million bridge facility which has a day term and matures in october the bridge facility currently bears interest at libor plus a margin of and increases by each quarter until repaid 
at maturity  the lenders have an option to convert the borrowings outstanding under the bridge facility into longer term exchange notes 
on october   the company used proceeds from the bridge facility to repay its million subordinated line of credit 
the company believes that the bridge facility will be refinanced prior to maturity with the issuance of longer term subordinated debt and an expansion of its existing revolving line of credit 
long term credit facilities 
in december  the company entered into the credit facility with a banking syndicate 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million under a revolving line of credit  the availability of which is determined by the company s projected pro forma cash flow 
the million borrowing capacity is reduced by million per quarter beginning september  the credit facility matures in march and bears interest  at the election of the company  at either the prime rate plus a margin of up to or a rate which is to above the applicable libor rate 
the credit facility is secured by all of the company s assets  including the stock of all of the company s subsidiaries  does not permit the payment of cash dividends and requires the company to comply with certain leverage  net worth and debt service covenants 
at march   the company had million outstanding under the credit facility 
the company is currently in the process of negotiating an expansion of its revolving line of credit under the credit facility 
the company has entered into operating lease arrangements for the acquisition or development of operating facilities 
the leases under this arrangement each have a term of five years  include purchase and renewal options and provide for a substantial residual value guarantee approximately of the total cost by the company which could  under certain circumstances  be due upon termination of the leases 
upon termination of a lease  the company could either exercise a purchase option  or the facilities could be sold to a third party 
the company expects the fair market value of the leased facilities to substantially reduce or eliminate the company s potential obligation under the residual value guarantee 
at march  there was approximately million available under this arrangement 
the company has outstanding million of senior secured notes senior notes 
the senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature on july  under the senior notes purchase agreements  the company is required to make eight annual principal payments of million beginning on july  and comply with certain financial covenants 
earlier payments of principal are allowed subject to prepayment provisions 
interest is payable semi annually 
the holders of the senior notes and the lenders under the credit facility have a collateral sharing agreement whereby both sets of creditors have an equal security interest in all of the assets of the company 
as discussed above  current credit facilities do not provide sufficient financing to fund the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the bridge facility 
management believes that repayment of the bridge facility will be funded from potential proceeds of one  or a combination  of the efforts the company is currently pursuing or negotiating to raise long term financing including a the issuance of longer term subordinated debt  b an expansion of the existing revolving line of credit under the credit facility  c a sale and leaseback of certain owned facilities and leasehold interests  or d other debt or equity financing arrangements 
should the company not be successful in raising longer term financing pursuant to its efforts as described above before maturity of the bridge facility  the lender has an option to convert the borrowings outstanding under the bridge facility into eight year exchange notes  and to purchase up to five percent of the company s outstanding common stock at an exercise price of of the market price of the company s common stock as of the date of the exchange 
if these contemplated financing transactions are not consummated  the company would be required to seek alternative and potentially dilutive capital funding sources to repay the bridge facility when due 
no assurance can be made that the company will be able to obtain the various financings described above 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and related principally to a construction of the  bed d 
ray james prison expansions  b construction for the bed expansions at the big spring complex  c various hardware and software for information systems upgrades  d the purchase of the parkview center and an additional building in anchorage  alaska for future development  e leasehold improvements at the cornell abraxas youth center and f normal replacements of worn furniture and equipment 
furniture and equipment sale and leaseback 
in november  the company entered into an agreement for the sale and leaseback of certain of its furniture and equipment 
the company has purchase and lease renewal options at projected future fair market values under the agreements 
the leases are classified as operating leases 
as of december   furniture and equipment with carrying values totaling  were sold and the gains realized on the sale totaling  were deferred and are being credited to income as rent expense adjustments over the lease term 
year issues during  the company implemented a broad information systems upgrade 
in connection with that upgrade  the company upgraded certain hardware and software systems to ensure year compliance 
the company currently is not aware of any year compliance problems relating to its systems 
the company is also not aware of any material year problems with its third party suppliers or contracting governmental agencies 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate incurring material expenses or experiencing any material operational disruptions as a result of any year problems 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations during the past three years 
however  most of the company s facility management contracts provide for payments to the company of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the terms of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase the company s personnel costs the largest component of facility management expense or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in occupancy fees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company continually monitors exposure to market risk and develops appropriate strategies to manage this risk 
the company is not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
interest rate exposure the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates

the company s debt with variable interest is its revolving line of credit 
at december   approximately million of the long term debt was subject to variable interest rates
