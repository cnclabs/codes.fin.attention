item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its line of credit and debt 
at december   the company had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately  the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average implied interest rate of at december  the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the table presents principal repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands fair thereafter total value debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the future period  prevailing interest rates  and the company s hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements
