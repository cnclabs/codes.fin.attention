cost and expenses 
bankcard processing expenses should always reflect the changes in processing revenue 
a majority of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense and transaction expense  increased from  for fiscal year to  in the current fiscal year  a increase 
this was in direct relation to the increase in processing and transaction revenues for the current fiscal year 
the decrease in gross margin was attributable to the marketing efforts being made to the retail sectors  which traditionally carries a lower risk and therefore generates a smaller gross margin to the processor

the company was advised that the regional offices of both the occ and the fdic have submitted the applications to their washington dc offices where special purpose banks receive final review 
due to the fact the applications are classified as a special purpose bank  this application process has been unexpectedly slow 
however  management is still optimistic about obtaining preliminary approvals from both the occ and the fdic within the next couple of months 
if the occ and the fdic approvals are obtained  the company will immediately file with the federal reserve bank to become a bank holding company  a process estimated to take at least days 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had available cash of  restricted cash of  in reserve with its primary processing banks and working capital of  the company is currently financing its operations primarily from cash generated from operations 
during fiscal  the company generated  from operations 
the company generated  from the sale of asset 
net cash used in investing activities was  mainly as a result of equipment and software purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was  of which  was from the exercise of stock options and warants  and  from the issuance of a note payable 
this was offset by  repayment of notes payable 
overall  the company s cash balance increased by  in fiscal year accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts increased from  at september  to  at september  this is reflective of the increased month end billings to merchants due to revenue growth year over year 
inventory costs remained relatively constant from  at september  to  at september  at the present  the company s cash flows from operations is sufficient to support the current level of developments costs and marketing costs which would allow the company to further develop all of its check related products and services and fully integrate its sales and marketing efforts as a result of the recent acquisitions 
however  once the occ and the fdic approved the bank application  the company will need to seek additional funding to satisfy the anticipated capital requirements for the bank 
there is no assurance that the funding will be obtained based on terms that are acceptable to the company

changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is the type of hedge transaction 
the company does not believe that the new standard will have a material impact on the company s financial statements

revenues derived from the electronic processing of transactions are recognized at the time the transactions are processed by the merchant 
the principal contributors to the increase in bankcard processing revenue and transaction revenue are the increased revenue from the magic acquisition and the incremental effect of the pass through of higher interchange rates from the credit card associations  which was effective april additionally  transaction revenue from u haul also increased by from the prior year 
as of september  the company processed for over  active retail merchant accounts and equipment rental dealers located around the country

the company is now in the process of enhancing the software in the terminals to include credit card processing for the dealer s non u haul activities 
this will reduce the amount of equipment the dealer must have on his counter and simplify the dealer s day to day operations 
however  there is no assurance that these independent dealers will sign up with the company s credit card processing program 
revenue related to terminal sales is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
terminal sales increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase

this increase was partially offset by  u haul systems shipped in fiscal versus  systems shipped in fiscal other revenue which consist mainly of research and development revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this increase was attributable to software development work for innoventry  a casino cash advance provider  and the united states postal service usps

until this evaluation is complete  all further development is on hold 
it was emphasized to the company that the delay of active development under the pilot program should not imply that a decision has been made on the merits of the pilot program but that other issues are requiring the full resources of the usps at this time 
no commitment or indication was given regarding when the usps would complete its evaluations and dedicate resources to the pilot program but it was evident  in management s opinion  that the usps is still very interested in the company s system that serves the small volume usps offices 
costs and expenses 
bankcard processing expenses have generally remained constant as a percentage of processing revenue 
most of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense  transaction expense and customer service expense  increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this was directly attributable to the increase in bankcard processing and transaction revenue in fiscal year the cost of terminals sold and leased decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a decrease 
this was the result of higher gross margin from equipment sales due to lower pricing from equipment vendors 
additionally  no inventory allowance was recorded in fiscal year other operating costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was the research and development expenses on the cash advance project and the development costs of the check products and services for fiscal year selling  and general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase

however  the company may need to raise additional funds in order to support expansion or develop new business units that is strategic to the company s growth 
thee can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company  if at all
