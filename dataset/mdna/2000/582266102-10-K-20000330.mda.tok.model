item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we derive most of our revenue from o our core business of providing local  long distance and related communications services to end users  typically in a bundled package o the sale of advertising space in telephone directories o traditional local telephone company services through the operation of illinois consolidated telephone company ictc in east central illinois and dakota telecommunications group  inc in southeast south dakota o communications facilities and services dedicated for a particular customer s use we also derive revenue from o communications network maintenance services o telephone equipment sales  leasing  service and installation o video services o telemarketing services o computer networking services o other communications services  including cellular  operator  payphone and paging services 
we began providing traditional local telephone company services and other communications services as a result of our acquisition of cci in september  telephone directory advertising as a result of our acquisition of telecom usa publishing in september  and telemarketing services as a result of our acquisition of ruffalo cody in july the table set forth below summarizes our percentage of revenues from these sources year ended december  local and long distance communications service telephone directory advertising traditional local telephone company services dedicated facilities and services network maintenance and equipment services telemarketing services other communications services we began offering local and long distance services to business customers in january at the end of  we began offering  on a test basis  long distance services to residential customers 
in june  we began marketing and providing to residential customers in cedar rapids  iowa and iowa city  iowa an integrated package of communications services that includes local and long distance service  voice mail  internet access and travel card services 
since june  we have expanded the states in which we offer service to business customers to include iowa  illinois  indiana  michigan  minnesota  nebraska  wisconsin  north dakota  south dakota  colorado  missouri  utah  nebraska  washington  ohio and wyoming 
we also expanded our residential service to additional cities in iowa and illinois and began offering the service to customers in north dakota  south dakota  wisconsin  wyoming  colorado and michigan 
we plan to continue our efforts to market and provide local  long distance and other communications services to business customers and market our service to residential customers 
our principal operating expenses consist of cost of service  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  and depreciation and amortization 
cost of service primarily includes local services purchased from the megabells  costs to terminate the long distance calls of our customers through long distance carriers  costs of printing and distributing telephone directories and costs associated with maintaining the iowa communications network 
the iowa communications network is a fiber optic communications network that links many schools  libraries and other public buildings in the state of iowa 
sg a consists of sales and marketing  customer service and administrative expenses  including the costs associated with operating our communications network 
depreciation and amortization include depreciation of our telecommunications network and equipment  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions  amortization expense related to the excess of estimated fair market value in aggregate of options over the aggregate exercise price of such options granted to some of our officers  other employees and directors  and amortization of one time installation costs associated with transferring customers local line service from the regional bell operating companies to our local telecommunications service 
as we expand into new markets  both cost of service and sg a will increase 
we expect to incur cost of service and sg a expenses before achieving significant revenues in new markets 
fixed costs related to leasing of central office facilities needed to provide telephone services must be incurred prior to generating revenue in new markets  while significant levels of marketing activity may be necessary in the new markets in order for us to build a customer base large enough to generate sufficient revenue to offset such fixed costs and marketing expenses 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception as a result of efforts to build our customer base  develop and construct our communications network infrastructure  build our internal staffing  develop our systems and expand into new markets 
we expect to continue to focus on increasing our customer base and geographic coverage and bringing our customer base onto our communications network 
accordingly  we expect that our cost of service  sg a and capital expenditures will continue to increase significantly  all of which may have a negative impact on operating results 
in addition  our projected increases in capital expenditures will continue to generate negative cash flows from construction activities during the next several years while we install and expand our fiber optic communications network and develop wireless services 
we may also be forced to change our pricing policies to respond to a changing competitive environment  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our operating margin 
we cannot assure you that growth in our revenue or customer base will continue or that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows 
we have generated net operating losses since our inception and  accordingly  have incurred no income tax expense 
we have reduced the net deferred tax assets generated by these losses by a valuation allowance which offsets the net deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the tax loss carry forwards 
we will reduce the valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized

we need significant capital to continue to expand our operations  facilities  network and services 
we cannot assure you that our capital resources will permit us to fund our planned network deployment and operations or achieve operating profitability 
failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some of our expansion plans or expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as of january   based on our business plan  capital requirements and growth projections as of that date  we estimated that we would require approximately billion through our estimated aggregate capital requirements include the projected costs of o building our fiber optic communications network  including intra city fiber optic communications networks o adding voice and atm switches o expanding operations in existing and new markets o developing wireless services o funding general corporate expenses o completing recent and pending acquisitions o constructing  acquiring  developing or improving telecommunications assets the estimated costs and incremental capital needs associated with the acquisitions of splitrock is included in our estimated aggregate capital requirements 
we expect to use the following to address our capital needs o approximately  million of cash and investments on hand at december  o additional issuances of debt or equity securities o projected operating cash flow our estimate of future capital requirements is a forward looking statement within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ substantially from our estimate due to factors such as o strategic acquisition costs and effects of acquisitions on our business plan  capital requirements and growth projections o unforeseen delays o cost overruns o engineering design changes o changes in demand for our services o regulatory  technological or competitive developments o new opportunities we also expect to evaluate potential acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances on an ongoing basis 
we may require additional financing if we pursue any of these opportunities 
accordingly  we may need additional capital to continue to expand our markets  operations  facilities  network and services 
our projected additional funding need is approximately million through based on the difference between existing cash balances and the combined mcleodusa and splitrock business plan  capital requirements and growth projections 
this projected additional funding need assumes that the splitrock senior notes due  which are redeemable by the holders upon a change of control  will remain outstanding at the completion of the splitrock merger 
we may meet any additional capital needs by issuing additional debt or equity securities or borrowing funds from one or more lenders 
we cannot assure you that we will have timely access to additional financing sources on acceptable terms 
failure to generate or raise sufficient funds may require us to delay or abandon some of our expansion plans or expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business risk factors failure to raise necessary capital could restrict our ability to develop our network and services and engage in strategic acquisitions 
market risk see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk results of the year date conversion issue the year conversion issue  which involved the millennial date change from to  threatened to impact computer programs and hardware timers using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
prior to the end of  we completed our review of our system readiness for the processing of date sensitive information by our computerized information systems 
upon the occurrence of the millennial date change  none of our computer systems appeared to suffer material adverse effects from the year conversion 
we incurred costs arising from our year readiness process in the amount of million 
our review and related year readiness activities did not cause us to defer or forego  to any material degree  any other critical information technology project 
you should be aware that there is the possibility of latent defects or issues related to the year conversion issue that could result in future miscalculations or system failures 
if we  our major vendors  our material service providers or our customers fail to identify and address any latent year issues in a timely manner  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on local exchange carriers  primarily the megabells  to provide most of our local and some of our long distance services 
to the extent u s west and sbc ameritech fail to address latent year issues which might interfere with their ability to fulfill their obligations to us  such interference could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
if other telecommunications carriers are unable to resolve such issues  it is likely that we will be affected to a similar degree as others in the telecommunications industry 
effects of new accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair market value on the balance sheet 
the company does not expect the impact of the adoption of sfas to be material to its results of operations as it does not currently hold any derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we recorded our marketable equity securities at a fair value of million 
these securities have exposure to price risk 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in quoted market prices would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of investments of approximately million 
we believe our exposure to market price fluctuations on all other investments is nominal due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations
