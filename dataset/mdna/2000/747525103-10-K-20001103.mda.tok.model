in addition  the company designs  manufactures and distributes products and provides services for its omnitracs system 
the company has contracts with globalstar to design  develop and manufacture consumer and ground communications equipment 
on july   qualcomm announced that it intends to spin off its integrated circuits and system software solutions business 
in connection with this announcement  qualcomm filed a current report on form k dated july  revenues from hardware product sales are recorded upon shipment  or when risk of loss passes to the customer  if later 
revenue from services is recorded when earned 
revenue from long term contracts  including technology development agreements  is recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs 
billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as unearned revenue 
estimated contract losses are recognized when determined 
license fees are recognized when delivery requirements have been met and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recorded as earned in accordance with the specific terms of each license agreement when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  the company began to accrue its estimate of certain royalty revenues earned that previously could not be reasonably estimated prior to being reported by its licensees 
the company recognizes software license revenue when all of the following criteria are met execution of a written agreement  delivery of software  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the proceeds is assessed as being probable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of multiple element arrangements 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or if not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management or a substantive renewal rate for post contract customer support

in june  the fcc awarded a million auction discount voucher adv to qualcomm to use in any fcc spectrum auction for one or more licenses over a period of up to three years 
fully transferable  the adv may be used in whole or in part by any entity in any auction  including those in which qualcomm is not a participant 
the fcc award is in response to a july us court of appeals decision in which the fcc was ordered to designate qualcomm a pioneer under the commission s pioneer s preference program  and grant qualcomm spectrum forthwith 
the fcc awarded the adv to qualcomm in lieu of granting spectrum 
two auctions  one in the mhz band and one for licenses reclaimed from former c block license holders  have been scheduled by the fcc over the next several months 
the company is currently exploring opportunities to participate in these auctions directly or through a partnership or consortium with other parties or to sell the adv to a third party 
the company will record the realized value of the adv if it is sold 
acquisition in march  the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of snaptrack  a developer of wireless position location technology  in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price was approximately billion  representing the value of qualcomm shares issued to effect the purchase  the value of vested and unvested options and warrants exchanged at the closing date and estimated transaction costs of million 
the preliminary allocation of purchase price  based on the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  reflects acquired goodwill of million  purchased in process technology of million and other intangible assets of million 
tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material to the company s financial statements 
the company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation within one year and does not anticipate material adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation 
amounts allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
the acquisition has been treated as a non cash transaction in the statement of cash flows 
purchased in process technology was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the fair values for each of the in process technologies were determined by estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products after their completion and commercialization  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying the percentage completion of the projects thereto 
the fair value of in process technology was determined to be million  including multimedia asic million  server release million  dsp release million and the pager product million 
net cash flow projections were made based on an assessment of customer needs and the expected pricing and cost structure 
due to the limited operational history of snaptrack  its relatively new technologies and lack of operating profit before the acquisition date  the expense and margin assumptions on which the cash flow projections were based  differ significantly from the historical performance 
a meaningful comparison between projections and historical performance could not be made at the date of acquisition 
dsp release is the software solution for position determination to be implemented on cellular phones 
dsp release was expected to be completed in june  with commercialization and material cash flows beginning in as an alternative technology  snaptrack was also developing multimedia asic  a standalone hardware solution based on a time domain approach 
the multimedia asic is intended to provide a low cost solution and time to market advantage for snaptrack s customers 
at the date of the acquisition  the project was expected to be completed and commercialized in september  with material cash flows beginning in the pager product was intended to allow the use of a pager product as a tracking device by providing a position location enabled two way paging solution 
the project was scheduled for completion in may  commercialization and material cash flows were expected to begin in the server release was being developed to support cellular phones for position determination 
server release was also designed to support snaptrack s pager product 
the cost of equity was determined by combining a risk free rate of return with an equity risk premium multiplied by a volatility factor that is based on the performance of common stock prices of similar publicly traded companies 
employing these data  the discount rate attributable to the business was  which was used for valuing completed technology 
the discount rate includes a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
considering the stage of completion and the technological risks  the risk adjusted discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model was for dsp release  multimedia asic and the server release  and for the pager product 
all of the in process technologies mentioned above had their system design and detailed hardware and software designs completed  testing  software implementation  integration testing phases had either not started or were incomplete at the date of acquisition 
stage of completion was estimated by considering time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition as a percentage of total time  cost and effort required for the total project to achieve technological feasibility 
the concluded completion percentages were for dsp release  for multimedia asic  for server release  and for the pager product 
an inability to complete the in process technology within the expected timeframes could materially impact future revenues and earnings 
qualcomm began to benefit from the purchased in process technology in fiscal and is continuously monitoring its development projects 
management believes that the assumptions used on the valuation of purchased in process technology reasonably estimate the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
globalstar the company continues to provide services and sell products under a number of development and production contracts involving the globalstar system 
revenues resulting from the agreements with globalstar for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
because telephone systems using low earth orbit satellites are a new commercial technology  demand for globalstar s service is uncertain 
if globalstar fails to generate sufficient cash flow from operations through the marketing efforts of its service providers  it might be unable to fund its operating costs or service its debt 
on june   globalstar defaulted on a million bank facility that qualcomm partially guaranteed in as a result of this default  qualcomm s guaranty was called  and qualcomm paid million to the subject banks in full satisfaction of this guaranty 
pursuant to an agreement entered into in  globalstar caused qualcomm to accept  in satisfaction of qualcomm s subrogation rights  a subordinated promissory note issued by globalstar with a principal amount equal to the amount qualcomm paid under its guaranty the globalstar promissory note 
the globalstar promissory note bears interest at libor plus  and principal and interest are due and payable in full on june  in september  globalstar telecommunications limited gtl announced an agreement with bear stearns co 
inc under which bear stearns will invest  subject to certain conditions  up to million in gtl common shares 
gtl is a publicly traded company that owns an approximate interest in globalstar 
globalstar has drawn down approximately million of this financing 
additional draws are contingent upon the gtl stock price trading above a price of per share 
globalstar concurrently announced that five of its founding partners and a sixth partner will provide additional equity financing 
under the terms of their subscription agreements  qualcomm  loral space communications  vodafone  elsacom  tesam  and chinasat agreed to invest million in gtl common shares
