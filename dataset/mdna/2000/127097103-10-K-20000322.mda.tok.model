item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and exploitation 
prior to  we operated in two regions the appalachian region and the western region  which included the mid continent  rocky mountains and gulf coast areas 
beginning in  a third region was created with the formation of the gulf coast region  leaving the mid continent and rocky mountains areas in the western region 
for purposes of the comparisons below  prior period results have been restated to conform to this three region structure 
overview our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
from the third quarter of through the first quarter of  we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices  resulting in lower revenues and net income during this period 
however  in the summer of and continuing into early  prices improved 
this more favorable price environment helped us improve from a million net loss in the first quarter of to net income of million in the fourth quarter 
we reported earnings of per share  or million  for this is up from the per share  or million  reported in the improvement is partially credited to the stronger commodity price environment during the last half of the year  accompanied by a increase in equivalent production 
our realized natural gas price for the fourth quarter of per mcf was higher than last year s fourth quarter price of per mcf 
our price for the entire year of per mcf was higher than the price of per mcf 
also contributing to our results were the following selected items million in revenue received for the monetization of a long term gas sales contract in december a million gain realized on the sale of non strategic assets  primarily in appalachia the recognition of a million impairment of long lived assets the million pre tax provision for certain wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the section tight gas sands credit following a recent industry tax court ruling 
a discussion of these selected items can be found in the results of operations section  beginning on page total equivalent production for was bcfe  an increase of over  despite the appalachian divestiture and the significantly reduced drilling program in place for compared to this increase was due primarily to production from the december oryx acquisition and new production brought on by the and drilling programs of a combined gross net wells 
during  we entered into several property sales intended to high grade our reserve base 
in september  we sold appalachian properties with reserves of bcfe for million 
subsequent to this sale  we used part of the proceeds from this divestiture of non strategic properties to purchase million of proved reserves adjacent to our existing properties in wyoming s green river basin and the balance of the proceeds to reduce debt by million 
these acquired properties added bcfe of proved reserves and approximately  undeveloped acres 
additionally  we sold other non strategic properties in several smaller transactions during the year for million 
in total  assets sales resulted in a gain of million 
these actions eliminated approximately of our total well count but reduced our production by only 
we purchased producing oil and gas properties and other assets located in south louisiana from oryx energy company for million in december these properties included interests in fields covering  net acres with producing wells 
the acquisition also included a square mile d seismic inventory 
proved reserves acquired were approximately bcfe 
by reworking certain non producing wells  we have increased the daily production rate from mmcfe in december to an average rate of mmcfe in in addition  we plan to commence our exploration and development drilling program on these properties in we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells and an success rate in total capital expenditures were million for compared to million in  which included million for the acquisition of the south louisiana properties 
we reduced our budgeted capital and exploration expenditures in response to the weak energy price environment in the fourth quarter of and in early however  we front end loaded the development and exploration plan to maximize production from this year s drilling program and to provide more flexibility to drill more wells if cash flows improved later in the year  which they did 
accordingly  during the year  we increased our capital and exploration expenditure program by approximately million in response to the improving natural gas prices during the third quarter 
as mentioned earlier  we received million in december to monetize a long term gas sales contract  which had been sourced by production from our rocky mountains area 
the contract provided for a fixed natural gas price that escalated annually 
the contract had a remaining term of less than nine years 
we have entered into certain forward sale agreements with other counterparties to deliver a similar quantity of gas at prices similar to those of the monetized contract 
these forward sale contracts had a remaining life of months at the end of during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant production decline from the only well in our chimney bayou field located in the texas gulf coast 
this decline  along with an unsuccessful workover in our lawson field in louisiana  resulted in a million impairment of long lived assets 
we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit  concentrating on the highest return opportunities  and from synergistic acquisitions 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the price of oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
natural gas prices were unseasonably low during much of and into the first half of in late spring and into the summer of  prices began to show improvement and by the fourth quarter  we experienced the highest quarterly realized price in two years 
the primary sources of cash for us during were funds generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties and the proceeds from the monetization of the long term gas sales contract 
funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures  proved property acquisitions  dividend payments and the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
we had net cash outflows of million during the net cash inflow from operating activities of million substantially offsets the million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures 
the cash proceeds from asset sales of million effectively funded the debt reduction and dividend payment 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in this improvement was a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and the monetization of the long term gas sales contract 
partially offsetting this benefit was the less favorable change in the balance sheet as we reduced the balance in accounts payable between year ends 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million lower than in  due predominantly to lower natural gas and oil prices  partially offset by a significant increase in the accounts payable balance resulting mainly from higher fourth quarter spending activity 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in were substantially attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in were million higher than in  due primarily to the capital and exploration expenditures that increased million over  and the receipt in of million in net proceeds from the sale of producing properties located in northwest pennsylvania 
these expenditures included million used to purchase south louisiana properties from oryx in december 
million spent as part of the joint exploration agreement with union pacific resources 
million used to acquire bcfe of proved reserves in the mid continent and rocky mountains areas of the western region 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows used by financing activities in included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders 
cash flows provided by financing activities in were increases in borrowings on the revolving credit facility related to the drilling program and million in property acquisitions 
financing activities in also included the payment of stock dividends and the purchase of shares in the open market under our share repurchase program 
the purchased shares are held as treasury shares 
cash flows used by financing activities from consist primarily of the million net reduction in borrowings on the revolving credit facility as well as dividend payments 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks  the revolving term of which runs to december the available credit line under this facility  currently million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
accordingly  oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation 
oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance 
while we do not currently believe that our credit availability is likely to be significantly reduced  management cannot predict how current price levels may change the banks long term price outlook 
therefore  we can give no assurance that our available credit line will not be adversely impacted in or as to the amount of credit that will continue to be available under this facility 
to reduce the impact of any redetermination  we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
at year end  this excess capacity totaled million  or of the total available credit line 
management believes that we have the ability to finance  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  we have a period of days to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line 
the revolving credit agreement also includes a requirement to pay down half of the debt in excess of the adjusted credit line within the first days of any adjustment 
our interest expense for is projected to be million 
in may  a million principal payment is due on our notes 
the amount is reflected as current portion of long term debt on our balance sheet 
the payment is expected to be made with cash from operations and  if necessary  from increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
capitalization our capitalization information is as follows as of december  in millions long term debt current portion of long term debt total debt stockholders equity common stock net of treasury stock preferred stock total equity total capitalization debt to capitalization during  dividends were paid on our common stock totaling million and on our convertible redeemable preferred stock totaling million 
we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition and capital requirements 
we have entered into an agreement with puget sound energy  inc  the holder of our preferred stock  to repurchase their preferred shares by november  as outlined in the agreement  the preferred shares that are recorded on our balance sheet for million will be repurchased for million 
cash flow from operations  additional borrowings or proceeds from the sale of equity may be used to fund this transaction 
please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this agreement 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expenses total includes million in oil and gas properties acquired from oryx energy company in december includes million in oil and gas properties acquired from equitable resources energy company in a like kind exchange transaction with a portion of the assets sold in the meadville property sale 
total capital and exploration expenditures for decreased million compared to  primarily as a result of this year s reduced drilling program and the million acquisition of proved properties from oryx in december additionally in  we made an initial million leasehold acquisition in connection with our joint exploration program with union pacific resources and also purchased bcfe of proved resources in the mid continent for million 
during the last half of  we acquired million of oil and gas properties in the moxa arch in the rocky mountains area  including gross wells  approximately bcfe of proved reserves and approximately  net undeveloped acres that complement our existing moxa arch development 
we plan to drill gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes million in total capital and exploration expenditures  up from million in expected spending in includes million for drilling and facilities  and million in exploration expenses 
in addition to the drilling and exploration program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for lease acquisitions and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
year many computer systems were built using software that processed transactions using two digits to represent the year 
this type of software generally required modifications to function properly with dates after december  or to become year compliant 
the same issue applied to microprocessors embedded in machinery and equipment  such as gas compressors and pipeline meters 
the impact of failing to identify those computer systems operated by us or our business partners that are not year compliant and to correct the problem could have been significant to our ability to operate and report results  as well as potentially expose us to third party liability 
we did not experience any computer system failures as a result of entering the year cabot oil gas will continue to monitor its computer systems for any potential errors that may have resulted from this change 
prior to january   we completed all of the necessary modifications to our computer systems and embedded microprocessors 
this project was completed on schedule and the total related costs were million  funded by cash from operations or borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
of the total project cost  million was attributable to the purchase of new software and equipment that was capitalized 
the remaining million was expensed 
prior to the end of  we contacted our significant customers and suppliers in order to determine our exposure to their potential failure to become year compliant 
although we are not aware of any year compliance problems with any of our customers or suppliers  we cannot guarantee that their systems have been operating or will continue to operate without interruption in the new millennium 
other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
cabot oil gas generates tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounts to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the appalachian region during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is per mmbtu in in and  cabot oil gas completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in and approximately million over the remaining three years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
cabot oil gas has benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference cannot reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
the company s operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
the company s ability to incur debt  to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock  and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  the company s revolving credit agreement and notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   the calculated ratio for was to in the unforeseen event that cabot oil gas fails to comply with these covenants  it may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow the company a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
conclusion our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms 
the average produced natural gas sales price received in was up over  after declining from to the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in with wide price swings in day to day trading on the nymex futures market 
given this continued price volatility  we cannot predict with certainty what pricing levels will be in the future 
because future cash flows are subject to these variables  we cannot assure you that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures 
while our plans now include million in capital spending  we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements  including  among other things  reductions in capital expenditures or common stock dividends 
we believe our capital resources  supplemented with external financing if necessary  are adequate to meet our capital requirements

results of operations for the purpose of reviewing our results of operations  net income is defined as net income available to common stockholders 
selected financial and operating data in millions except where specified net operating revenues operating expenses operating income interest expense net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted natural gas production bcf gulf coast west appalachia total company produced natural gas sales price mcf gulf coast west appalachia total company crude condensate volume mbbl price bbl the table below presents the after tax effects of certain selected items on our results of operations for the three years ended december  in millions net income before selected items monetization of gas sales contract impairment of long lived assets gain on sale of assets section tax credit provision net income these selected items impacted our financial results 
because they are not a part of our normal business  we have isolated their effects in the table above 
these selected items were as follows we had a year cogeneration contract under which we sold approximately of our western region natural gas per year 
the contract was due to expire in  but during we reached an agreement with the counterparty under which the counterparty bought out the remainder of the contract for million 
this transaction  completed in december  accelerated the realization of any future price premium that may have been associated with the contract and added million of pre tax other revenue 
we simultaneously sold forward a similar quantity of western region gas for the next months at similar prices to those in the monetized contract 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairments totaling million on two of our producing fields in the gulf coast region 
the chimney bayou field was impaired by million due to a significant reserve revision on the broussard middleton r well in connection with a decline in its natural gas production accompanied by a marked increase in water production 
the broussard middleton r was the only producing well in this field 
the lawson field was impaired by million due to an unsuccessful workover on one of its wells 
we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas assets  most notably the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region sold to enervest effective october we recorded a million reserve against other revenue for certain wells no longer deemed to be eligible for the section tight gas sands credit following a recent industry tax court ruling 
the ferc recently issued a rule proposal that may ultimately restore the eligibility for some or all of the wells in question 
we will continue to monitor other tax court decisions and announcements from the ferc regarding this issue 
and compared net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share  excluding the impact of the selected items 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
excluding the pre tax effect of the selected items  operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in natural gas production made up  or million  of net operating revenue 
the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million rise in crude oil and condensate sales  due to both price improvements and production volume increases 
price and production volume increases in natural gas also contributed to the higher operating revenues 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
net income was reduced by a million increase in interest expense 
natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production from the oryx acquisition  recent discoveries and development in the kacee field in south texas  and the redrilling of certain wells in the beaurline field 
natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during and natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf to bcf  as a result of the sale of certain non strategic assets in the appalachian region effective october   and a decrease in drilling activity in the region in total natural gas production was up bcf  or  yielding a revenue increase of million in the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing net operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price remained flat to last year at 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing revenues by million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year increased by mbbls  or  to mbbls  increasing net operating revenues by million 
the volume increase was largely due to production from the oryx acquisition 
crude oil prices rose per bbl  or  to  resulting in an increase to net operating revenues of approximately million 
the brokered natural gas margin decreased million to million 
the primary cause was a per mcf reduction to net margin that resulted in a million revenue decline 
the effect of the lower margin was partially offset by a bcf volume increase  resulting in a million increase in brokered natural gas margin 
excluding the selected items regarding the sales contract monetization and the section tax credit provision  other net operating revenues decreased million to million 
the decline was a result of decreases in activity in the following areas transportation revenue declined million 
revenue from our brine treatment plants declined million 
natural gas liquid sales declined million due to lower activity levels during section revenues decreased slightly due to normal production decline 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations  excluding the selected item related to the impairment of long lived assets  increased million  or  from due primarily to the following direct operating expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the incremental cost of operating the oryx properties acquired in december on a units of production basis  direct operating expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in exploration expense decreased million  or  primarily as a result of o a million reduction in dry hole costs from  largely due to a smaller drilling program in that resulted in seven dry holes compared to dry holes in o a million decrease in geological and geophysical costs over last year largely due to a decline in seismic acquisition costs in the appalachian region 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense  excluding the select item related to the fas impairment  increased million  or  over this increase was due to costs associated with the oryx properties  as well as higher finding costs in on certain fields in the gulf coast region that were largely related to mechanical difficulties associated with drilling 
a increase in total natural gas equivalent production  including a production increase in the higher finding cost gulf coast region  is the other major component of the dd a increase 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  due to o lower non cash stock compensation expense for stock awards million 
o lower outside consulting services million 
interest expense increased million primarily due to the debt increase for the oryx acquisition in december and to partially fund the drilling program 
income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax 
gain on the sale of assets totaled million for compared to million in these gains are the result of the non strategic asset divestitures  primarily the sale of the clarksburg properties in the appalachian region to enervest effective october and compared net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share  down million  or per share  compared to net operating revenue of million was down million  or  from natural gas sales of million accounted for of net operating revenue in the decrease in net operating revenue was the result of a decline in realized natural gas prices and a reduction in realized oil prices 
operating income and net income were similarly impacted by the decrease in energy commodity prices along with higher expenses attributable to our increased exploration program 
in the gulf coast region  natural gas production volume was up bcf  or  to bcf due to results of the and drilling programs  and in part to the december acquisition of the oryx properties 
while production increased over levels  the region did experience drilling delays and mechanical failures in a significant field that deferred production into but left the field s total reserves substantially unchanged 
natural gas production volume in the western region was up bcf  or  to bcf due to increases in rocky mountains area production 
this increase was the result of both the purchase of oil and gas producing properties located in the green river basin of wyoming  and new wells brought on line 
natural gas production volume was down bcf  or  to bcf in the appalachian region due to the september sale of producing properties located in northwest pennsylvania  which we refer to as the meadville properties 
the average natural gas sales price for the year in the gulf coast region decreased per mcf  or  to  reducing net operating revenue by million on bcf of production 
in the western region  the average natural gas sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing net operating revenues by million on bcf of production 
the average natural gas sales price decreased per mcf  or  to in the appalachian region  decreasing net operating revenues by approximately million on bcf of production 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price for the year decreased per mcf  or  to 
crude oil and condensate sales increased by mbbls  or  increasing revenue by million over this increase was due to new production brought on line  combined with december production from the oryx properties 
however  the average crude oil price declined from levels  reducing oil revenue by million 
brokered natural gas margin was up million to million due to a volume increase over  combined with a per mcf increase in the net margin to per mcf 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million  or  to million 
in december  we recognized a million reorganization charge designed to reduce future operating expenses 
the reorganization charge was comprised of million in direct operating expense  million in exploration expense  and million in general and administrative expense 
the reorganization reduced the number of our employees by 
the significant changes in operating expenses are explained as follows direct operations expense increased million  or  due primarily to the million direct operations component of the reorganization charge in the fourth quarter and million in higher workover costs incurred primarily in the gulf coast region 
exploration expense increased million  or  due to o a million increase in geological and geophysical activity including seismic data purchases and consulting fees 
o a million increase in dry hole cost  resulting from our expanded drilling efforts in the gulf coast region where wells are generally drilled at higher costs 
o a million increase in exploration personnel related expenses such as salaries  benefits and relocation charges associated with the increase in the exploration program 
o million for the exploration expense component of the reorganization that was expensed in december depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense increased million  or  primarily due to the amortization of a lease option purchased in the second quarter of related to a joint venture with union pacific resources in the gulf coast region 
additionally  this expense increased in part due to higher units of production expense in connection with increased production 
general and administrative expense increased million primarily due to o million for staffing increases in the third and fourth quarters of o million for non cash stock compensation for stock awards 
o million accrued for certain executive retirement and severance packages 
o million due to higher relocation and travel expenses 
o million recorded for the general and administrative component of the reorganization in december interest expense increased million  or  due to higher levels of debt outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
income tax expense was down million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax 
included in income tax expense was the interest charged by the internal revenue service on a deferred tax gain related to the monetization of the section credits 
this interest amount was million in and million in item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
oil and gas prices declined substantially in and  despite recent improvement  could decline again 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 
the level of consumer product demand 
weather conditions 
political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 
the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 
the price of foreign imports 
actions of governmental authorities 
domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 
overall economic conditions 
these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
in order to reduce our exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  we sometimes enter into hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
commodity price swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
during  we fixed the price at an average of per mmbtu on quantities totaling  mmbtu  representing of the natural gas production for the period 
the notional volume of the crude oil swap transactions was  bbls at a price of per bbl  which represents approximately one third of our total oil production for during and we did not enter into any fixed price swaps to hedge oil or natural gas production 
we use price swaps to hedge the natural gas price risk on brokered transactions 
typically  we enter into contracts to broker natural gas at a variable price based on the market index price 
however  in some circumstances  some of our customers or suppliers request that a fixed price be stated in the contract 
after entering into these fixed price contracts to meet the needs of our customers or suppliers  we may use price swaps to effectively convert these fixed price contracts to market sensitive price contracts 
these price swaps are held by us to their maturity and are not held for trading purposes 
during  and  we entered into price swaps with total notional quantities of   and  mmbtu  respectively  related to our brokered activities  representing  and  respectively  of our total volume of brokered natural gas sold 
as of the years ending december   and  we had open natural gas and oil price swap contracts as follows natural gas price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period mmbtu contract price in millions as of december  natural gas price swap on brokered transactions first quarter  as of december  natural gas price swap on brokered transactions full year  first quarter  financial derivatives related to natural gas reduced revenues by million in and million in these revenue reductions were offset by higher realized revenue on the underlying physical gas sales 
we had open oil price swap contracts as follows oil price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average gain loss contract period bbls contract price in millions as of december  oil price swaps on our production first quarter  second quarter  financial derivatives related to crude oil reduced revenue by million during this revenue reduction was offset by higher realized revenue on the underlying physical oil sales 
there were no crude oil price swaps outstanding at december   or we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas requires all derivatives to be recognized in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value
