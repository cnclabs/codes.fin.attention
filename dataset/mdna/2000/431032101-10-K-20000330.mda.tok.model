using full year gross premiums written for american reliance produces a decline in of approximately due primarily to the same issues impacting the decline in gross premiums written  as noted above 
the declines were partially offset by approximately million of unusually large increases in premiums under retrospectively rated policies 
gross premiums written for retrospectively rated policies may be adjusted up or down  subject to certain limitations contained in the policy  based on the estimated loss experience of the insured during the policy period 
the company estimates ultimate losses for retrospectively rated policies and then adjusts gross premiums written and premiums due from policyholders for changes in estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses from the date of the prior valuation 
these adjustments may cause gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned to fluctuate significantly from period to period

the company recorded a tax benefit of million in and a tax expense of million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves underwriting results of the property and casualty industry are significantly influenced by estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these reserves are an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to settle and pay all outstanding and unreported claims including loss adjustment expenses  net of estimated claim recoveries 
the case reserve estimates for reported claims are based upon the facts of each case and the company s experience with similar cases 
consideration is given to historical trends regarding reserving patterns  changes in the company s operations such as underwriting and claims handling  loss payments  and the effects of court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
the process of establishing reserves is imprecise involving significant judgment and assumptions 
as information develops that varies from experience  provides additional data or  in some cases  augments data that previously was not considered sufficient for use in determining reserves  changes in the company s estimate of ultimate liabilities may be required 
changes in prior year reserve estimates net of reinsurance  which may be material  are reflected in the results of operations in the period such changes are determined to be required 
during the last several years  the company has experienced significant adverse development on prior years net ultimate loss estimates 
the following table sets forth the amount of the adverse development for the periods indicated 
years ended december  dollars in millions net reserve re estimates due to stop loss agreement asbestos and environmental all other net adverse development as a result of changes in estimates of insured events in prior years  primarily asbestos and environmental claims  construction defect claims and catastrophe claims  and the effects of the termination of the stop loss agreement in  the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense incurred net of reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million for  and  respectively decreased by million in and increased million in and million in the principal reason for the loss reserve development in was the termination of the stop loss agreement 
in addition  the emergence of environmental  asbestos and construction defect claims over the last few years and the difficulty in accurately estimating the necessary reserves have significantly contributed to the company s loss reserve development over the three year period 
the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are reviewed at each year end by the company s actuaries and external independent actuaries in connection with the process of establishing the company s reserve position

the liquidity requirements of the insurance subsidiaries are met by that portion of the investment portfolio that is held in cash and highly liquid securities

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of lower securities and portfolio values resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes 
the company s investment strategy is to maximize income and total return by investing in a diverse portfolio of high quality investment grade securities 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  and was million and  million  respectively 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not material 
the company has no direct commodity risk 
the company has exposure to market price declines resulting from increases in interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management including limiting average portfolio duration to approximately four and one half years 
market prices for all securities held are updated and reviewed monthly including estimates of cash flows as well as the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the company s investment portfolio 
for the company s investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed for compared to the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis 
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible changes in those rates over a one year period 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for this analysis  the company assumes an instantaneous shift in interest rates and that the composition of its investment portfolio remains relatively constant 
also  the company assumes a change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across all financial instruments even though interest rates on certain types of instruments may fluctuate or lag behind other instruments 
the rates should not be considered a prediction by the company of future events 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on the company s income  cash flow and stockholders equity 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million and million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  and  respectively 
this loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments  which constitute approximately of total assets and approximately of total liabilities as of december  and approximately of total assets and approximately of total liabilities as of december  as a result  the loss value excludes a significant portion of the company s consolidated balance sheet which would materially mitigate the impact of the loss in fair value 
in addition to the above  the company s credit agreement is also subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would result in additional annual interest expense of
