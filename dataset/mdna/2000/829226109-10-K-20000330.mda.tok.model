item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified broadcasting company that owns or provides programming services pursuant to lmas to more television stations than any other commercial broadcasting group the united states 
we currently own  or provide programming services pursuant to lmas to  television stations and radio stations 
during  we sold the majority of our radio stations and we have entered into agreements to sell or intend to enter into to sell in the future our remaining radio stations 
in addition  we own equity interests in three internet related companies 
our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers and television network compensation 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of local broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is primarily resulting from an increase in the number of media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate this trend include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and the development of innovative marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to national advertisers 
our primary operating expenses involved in owning  operating or programming the television and radio stations are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries  and news gathering and station promotional costs 
amortization and depreciation of costs associated with the acquisition of the stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues broadcast revenue dollars in thousands years ended december  local regional advertising    national advertising    network compensation    political advertising   production    broadcast revenues    less agency commissions    broadcast revenues  net    barter revenues    total revenues    our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were syndicated programming  network programming  direct advertising programming  sports programming and children s programming 
similarly  our four largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were automotive  fast food advertising  retail department stores and professional services 
no other advertising category accounted for more than of our net broadcast revenues in no individual advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the years ended december   and for definitions of items  see footnotes on pages and of this report

the increase in net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comprised of million related to businesses acquired or disposed of by us in and collectively the and transactions offset by a million decrease in net broadcast revenues on a same station basis  representing a decrease over prior year s net broadcast revenue for these stations 
on a same station basis  revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in revenues in the raleigh  norfolk and sacramento markets 
our television stations in the raleigh and norfolk markets experienced a decrease in ratings which resulted in a loss in revenues and market revenue share primarily due to the loss of their affiliation agreements with fox  which expired on august  in the sacramento market  revenues decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to the absence of political and olympic revenues experienced during on a same station basis  our national revenues decreased approximately and our local revenues increased approximately 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of local broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is primarily resulting from an increase in the number of media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services 
total operating costs increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or 
the increase in operating costs for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comprised of million related to the and transactions  million related to an increase in corporate overhead expenses  and million related to an increase in operating costs on a same station basis  representing a increase over prior year s operating costs for those stations 
the increase in corporate overhead expenses for the year ended december  primarily resulted from an increase in legal fees and an increase in salary costs incurred to manage a larger base of operations 
the increase in operating costs on a same station basis primarily resulted from costs incurred during related to our agreements with the fox and wb networks which were not incurred in our payments to the fox network related to the purchase of additional prime time inventory and our payments to the wb network related to our agreement with the network which requires us to make payments as ratings increase 
we expect to incur these costs in future periods 
in addition  we experienced an increase in commissions due to a larger number of local account executives 
the increased number of account executives is part of our strategy to increase the percentage of our revenues derived from local advertising and we expect this to increase further in as we add additional account executives

the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily resulted from higher interest expense related to acquisitions closed in the second half of and a high applicable interest rate margin for borrowing under our bank credit agreement 
subsidiary trust minority interest expense of million for the year ended december  is related to the private placement of the million aggregate liquidation value high yield trust offered preferred securities the hytops completed march  interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the average cash balance during the fiscal year as compared to the same period in net income for the year ended december  was million or per share compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  the change in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was primarily due to the gain on the sale of radio broadcast assets related to discontinued operations 
in addition  the change in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was also attributable to the recognition of an unrealized gain on a treasury option derivative instrument  offset by an increase in interest expense 
as noted above  our net income for the year ended december  included recognition of an unrealized gain of million on a treasury option derivative instrument 
upon execution of the treasury option derivative instrument  we received a cash payment of million 
the treasury option derivative instrument will require us to make five annual payments equal to the difference between minus the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities on september  times the million notional amount of the instrument 
if the yield on five year treasuries is equal to or greater than on september   we will not be required to make any payment under the terms of this instrument 
if the rate is below on that date  we will be required to make payments  as described above  and the size of the payment will increase as the rate goes down 
each year  we recognize income or expense equal to the change in the projected liability under this arrangement based on interest rates at the end of the year 
if the yield on five year treasuries at september  were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on december  for treasuries settled on september   we would not be required to make payments

on a same station basis  revenues were negatively impacted by a decrease in revenues in the baltimore  milwaukee  norfolk and raleigh markets 
our television stations in these markets experienced a decrease in ratings which resulted in a loss in revenues and market revenue share 
in the raleigh and norfolk television markets  our affiliation agreements with fox expired on august  which further contributed to a decrease in ratings and revenues 
in the baltimore market  the addition of a new upn affiliate competitor contributed to a loss in ratings and market revenue share 
an additional factor which negatively impacted station revenues for the year was the loss of general motors advertising revenues caused by a strike of its employees 
these decreases in revenue on a same station basis were offset by revenue growth at certain of our other television stations combined with an increase in network compensation revenue and political advertising revenue

however  cash balances were lower at december  than at december  net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share compared to net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  net loss increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  subsidiary trust minority interest expense  the recognition of an unrealized loss of million on a derivative instrument and the recognition of an extraordinary loss offset by an increase in total revenues  a gain on the sale of broadcast assets and an increase in interest and other income 
our extraordinary loss of million net of a related tax benefit of million resulted from the write off of debt acquisition costs associated with indebtedness replaced by the bank credit agreement 
as noted above  our net loss for the year ended december  included recognition of a loss of million on a treasury option derivative instrument 
upon execution of the treasury option derivative instrument  we received a cash payment of million 
the treasury option derivative instrument will require us to make five annual payments equal to the difference between minus the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities on september  times the million notional amount of the instrument

in any event  we will not be required to make any payments until september  broadcast cash flow increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   or

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and availability under our bank credit agreement 
as of december   we had million in cash balances and excluding the effect of assets held for sale  broadcast assets related to discontinued operations and income taxes payable  working capital of approximately million 
as of march   the remaining balance available under the revolving credit facility was million 
based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels for the twelve months ended december   we had approximately million available of current borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
our bank credit agreement also provides for an incremental term loan commitment in the amount of up to million which can be utilized upon approval by the agent bank and the raising of sufficient commitments from banks to fund the additional loans 
in july  we entered into an agreement to sell radio stations in nine markets to entercom communications corporation entercom for million in cash 
the transaction does not include our radio stations in the st 
louis market which are subject to the st 
louis purchase option 
in december  we closed on the sale of radio stations in eight markets for a purchase price of million 
we expect to close on the remaining million during which represents the kansas city radio stations and wkrf fm in wilkes barre 
the completion of the kansas city transaction is subject to fcc and department of justice approval 
the completion of the wilkes barre transaction is subject only to fcc approval and the outcome of pending litigation in which a former licensee is seeking the return of the wkrf fm license based on a fraudulent conveyance claim 
on april   we entered into an agreement the atc agreement with american tower corporation  an independent owner  operator and developer of broadcast and wireless communication sites in the united states 
under the agreement  we would provide american tower access to tower sites in a number of our markets including nashville  tn  dayton  oh  richmond  va  mobile  al  pensacola  fl  san antonio  tx  and syracuse  ny 
american tower would construct new towers in each of these markets and would lease space on the towers to us 
this is expected to provide us the additional tower capacity required to develop its digital television transmission needs in these markets at an initial capital outlay lower than would be required if we constructed these towers ourselves 
the form of the master lease has been completed and agreed to  however  each market is subject to individual negotiations on terms specific to that market  which are still being negotiated with american tower corporation 
if we cannot agree with american tower on the terms and conditions of the individual market leases  neither party will have any obligation to the other under the atc agreement  which will then become a nullity 
net cash flows from operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the increase in program contract payments 
we made payments of interest on outstanding indebtedness and subsidiary trust minority interest expense totaling million during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  program rights payments for the year ended december  increased million or 
this increase in program rights payments was comprised of million related to the and transactions and million related to an increase in programming costs on a same station basis which increased net cash flows from investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of billion for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we made cash payments of approximately million related to the acquisition of television and radio broadcast assets primarily by utilizing available indebtedness under our bank credit agreement 
these payments included million related to the april guy gannett acquisition  million related to the july guy gannett acquisition  million related to the st 
louis radio acquisition  and million related to other acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we received approximately million of cash proceeds related to the sale of certain television and radio broadcast assets which was primarily utilized to repay indebtedness under the bank credit agreement 
these cash proceeds included million related to the entercom disposition  million related to the barnstable disposition  million related to the cca disposition  and million related to other dispositions 
during the year ended december   we made equity interest investments of approximately million  including million related to an investment in acrodyne  million related to an investment in allegiance capital limited partnership  million related to an investment in beautybuys 
com  and million related to an investment in tuscaloosa tower 
we made payments for property and equipment of million for the year ended december  in addition  we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and additional strategic station acquisitions and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms 
net cash flows used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash flows from financing activities of billion for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repaid million and million under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility components of the bank credit agreement  respectively  primarily from proceeds of the sale of radio stations 
in addition  we utilized borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million primarily to fund acquisition activity including the guy gannett acquisition 
during and as of december   we repurchased and retired  shares of our class a common stock for approximately million 
during and as of march   we repurchased and retired  shares of our class a common stock for aproximately million 
income taxes the income tax provision increased to million for the year ended december  from a provision of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the provision for continuing operations and discontinued operations is million and million respectively 
for the year ended december   the provision for continuing operations and discontinuing operations is and million respectively 
for  our pre tax book loss from continuing operations was million and we recorded a tax expense of million 
we recognized this provision on a pre tax loss because our non deductible tax items were in excess of the pre tax loss and these items caused continuing operations to have taxable income 
these non deductible tax items primarily consisted of non deductible goodwill associated with stock acquisitions 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase in net deferred tax liability from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is due to the use of federal and state net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits as a result of the sale of radio assets 
additionally  accelerated tax depreciation and amortization of fixed and intangible assets contributed to an increase in deferred tax liabilities 
the income tax provision increased to million for the year ended december  from a provision of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily resulted from an increase in non deductible tax items including the deferred tax liability related to the hytops transaction and non deductible goodwill related to stock acquisitions 
seasonality our results usually are subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in fourth quarter broadcast operating income being greater usually than first  second and third quarter broadcast operating income 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
in addition  revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered years 
year we spent approximately million over the past two years updating hardware and software systems to ensure year compliance 
the four phases of our year plan consisted of inventory and data collection  compliance requests  test fix and verify  final testing and new item compliance 
each of the four phases of our year process have been successfully completed and no disruptions to operations occurred as a result of year although we have completed all phases of our year compliance project and currently believe all of our systems to be year compliant  we cannot assure you that any of our systems will be year compliant in future dates 
in addition  we cannot assure you that outside systems indirectly related to our operations are year compliant or will be year compliant in future dates 
risk factors we believe that our future operating results and funds generated from operations and available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet general corporate requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot identify nor can we control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
some of the circumstances that may occur and may impair our business are described below 
if any of the following circumstances were to occur  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations to you 
we have a high level of debt and other obligations compared to stockholders equity 
our obligations include the following indebtedness under the bank credit agreement 
as of december   we owed  million under our bank credit agreement and had a million remaining balance available 
based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels for the twelve months ended december   we had approximately million available of current borrowing capacity under our bank credit agreement 
indebtedness under notes 
we have issued and outstanding three series of senior subordinated notes 
the total amount outstanding under these notes as of december  was million 
obligations under high yield trust offered preferred securities hytops 
sinclair capital  a subsidiary trust of sinclair  has issued million aggregate liquidation amount of hytops 
aggregate liquidation amount means the amount sinclair capital must pay to the holders when it redeems the hytops or upon liquidation 
sinclair capital must redeem the hytops in we are indirectly liable for the hytops obligations because we issued million liquidation amount of series c preferred stock to kdsm  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to support million aggregate principal amount of notes that kdsm  inc issued to sinclair capital to support the hytops 
series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
we have issued  shares of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
the liquidation preference means we would be required to pay the holder of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock million before we paid holders of common stock or any other stock that is junior to the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock in any liquidation of sinclair 
we are not obligated to buy back or retire the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock  but may do so at our option beginning in at a conversion rate of per share 
in some circumstances  we may also exchange the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for subordinated debentures due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
program contracts payable and programming commitments 
we enter into contracts to purchase future programming 
under these contracts  we were obligated on december  to make future payments totaling million 
our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks to you and to sinclair o we use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends on preferred stock 
this will limit the amount available for other purposes 
for the year ended december   we would have been required to pay million in interest and preferred dividends including dividend payments on the hytops if all of our material securities and acquisition and divestiture transactions during had been completed as of january  o our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs  additional acquisitions  or other purposes 
o the interest rate under our bank credit agreement is a floating rate  and will increase if general interest rates increase 
this will increase the portion of our cash flow that must be spent on interest payments 
o we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures 
o if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments  we might have to refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations 
any of these effects could reduce the trading value of our securities 
our flexibility is limited by promises we have made to our lenders 
our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests 
these restrictions and tests include the following o restrictions on additional debt  o restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for our indebtedness  o restrictions on payment of dividends  the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to capital stock  o restrictions on some sales of assets and the use of proceeds of asset sales  o restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions  satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions  and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without consent of bank lenders  o restrictions on the type of businesses we and our subsidiaries may be in  o restrictions on type and amounts of investments we and our subsidiaries may make  and o financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to total interest expense  the ratio of ebitda to certain of our fixed expenses  and the ratio of indebtedness to ebitda 
future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests 
these restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities  or may require actions that decrease the value of securities 
in addition  we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral 
if this happened  we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce the value of our securities 
key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite to those of sinclair 
some of our officers and directors own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting  do business with us  or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests 
david d 
smith  frederick g 
smith  and j 
duncan smith are each an officer and director of sinclair  and robert e 
smith is a director 
together  the smiths hold shares of our stock that have a majority of the voting power 
the smiths own a business that operates a television station in st 
petersburg  florida 
the smiths also own businesses that lease real property and tower space to us  buy advertising time from us  and engage in other transactions with us 
in addition  relatives of the smiths hold a majority of the equity  but not the voting control  of glencairn  ltd 
glencairn holds the licenses for television stations that we program under local marketing agreements with glencairn 
maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers  directors and majority stockholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that sinclair might pursue 
these limitations do not  however  prohibit all such transactions 
officers  directors and majority stockholders may therefore transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest 
the smiths exercise control over all matters submitted to a stockholder vote  and may have interests that differ from yours 
david d 
smith  frederick g 
smith  j 
duncan smith and robert e 
smith control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
the smiths hold class b common stock  which generally has votes per share 
our class a common stock has only one vote per share 
our other series of preferred stock generally do not have voting rights 
we describe in detail the voting rights of shares of our capital stock in portions of sinclair s proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders under the heading security ownership of certain beneficial owners  which we have incorporated by reference in this report 
as of december   the smiths held shares representing of the vote on most matters and representing of the vote on the few matters for which class b shares have only one vote per share 
the smiths have agreed with each other that until they will vote for each other as director 
certain features of our capital structure may deter others from attempting to acquire sinclair 
the control the smiths have over stockholder votes may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
in addition  our board of directors can issue additional shares of preferred stock with rights that might further discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
anyone trying to acquire us would likely offer to pay more for shares of class a common stock than the amount those shares were trading for in market trades at the time of the offer 
if the voting rights of the smiths or the right to issue preferred stock discourage such takeover attempts  stockholders may be denied the opportunity to receive such a premium 
the general level of prices for class a common stock might also be lower than it would be if these deterrents to takeovers did not exist 
we depend on advertising revenue  which may decrease depending on a number of conditions 
our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time 
our ability to sell advertising time depends on o the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  o the popularity of our programming  o changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located  o the activities of our competitors  and o other factors that may be beyond our control 
for example  a labor dispute or other disruption at a major national advertiser  or a recession in a particular market  would make it more difficult to sell advertising time and could reduce our revenue 
we must purchase television programming in advance  but cannot predict if a particular show will be popular enough to cover its cost 
one of our most significant costs is television programming 
if a particular program is not popular  we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program 
since we purchase programming content from others  we also have little control over the costs of programming 
we usually must purchase programming several years in advance  and may have to commit to purchase more than one year s worth of programming 
finally  we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred  or accounted fully for the costs on our books for financial reporting purposes 
any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues 
we may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation with us 
we also cannot be sure the networks will provide attractive programming 
all but one of our television stations operate as affiliates of a network 
the vast majority of our prime time programming in network affiliated stations comes from their networks 
our fox affiliates acquired in connection with the sullivan and max media acquisitions in as further discussed in note to the attached financial statements and three of our abc affiliates do not have affiliation agreements with their respective network 
the networks may terminate the affiliation of stations that do have affiliation agreements  under certain circumstances  with between days and six months notice 
the relationship between networks and station owners is currently undergoing significant change  and the networks may seek reduced or no fees to owners and may seek increased compensation in the form of additional advertising  cash payments or in other forms 
networks may seek and receive terms that reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
if a network terminates or fails to renew our affiliation  we will lose access to the programming offered by that network 
we will need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive or more expensive 
competition from other broadcasters and other sources may cause our advertising sales to go down or our costs to go up 
we face intense competition in our industry and markets from the following new technology and the subdivision of markets 
new technologies enable our competitors to tailor their programming for specific segments of the listening and viewing public to a degree not possible before 
as a result  the overall market share of broadcasters  such as us whose equipment may not permit such a discriminating approach is under new pressures 
the new technologies include o cable  o satellite to home distribution  o pay per view  and o home video and entertainment systems 
future technology under development 
cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment 
these so called video compression techniques will reduce the cost of creating channels  and may lead to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
video compression is available to us as well  but competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
in market competition 
we also face more conventional competition from rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than us 
these include o other local free over the air radio and broadcast stations  and o other media  such as newspapers and periodicals 
deregulation 
recent changes in law have also increased competition 
the telecommunications act of the act created greater flexibility and removed some limits on station ownership 
the prices for stations have risen as a result 
telephone  cable  and some other companies are also free to provide video services in competition with us 
other proposed legislation would relax existing prohibitions on the simultaneous ownership of telephone and cable businesses 
as a result of these changes  new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us 
our recent investments in internet businesses may not deliver the value we paid for them or reach our strategic objectives 
our strategy now includes investing in and working with internet related businesses 
in pursuit of this strategy  we made three equity investments in internet related businesses in and intend to make additional investments as appropriate opportunities arise 
the long term value of internet related businesses has yet to be determined  and we cannot assure you that these investments will be worth the amount of our investment  or that we will be able to develop services that are profitable for sinclair or the businesses in which we have invested 
if the businesses in which we have invested fail to succeed  we may lose as much as all of our investment in the businesses 
we may also spend additional funds and devote additional resources to these businesses  and these additional investments may also be lost 
the phased introduction of digital television will increase our operating costs and may expose us to increased competition 
the fcc has mandated the phased introduction of digital television from to  starting with the affiliates of abc  cbs  fox and nbc in the top ten markets 
these stations were required to commence broadcasting in digital format by may  the affiliates of these networks in the next markets were required to commence digital broadcasting by november we had no stations that needed to have digital operations by the may  deadline and stations that needed to meet the november deadline 
as of the date of this k  none of our stations are broadcasting in digital format 
the fcc has granted dtv construction permits and extensions to commence digital operations until may with respect to two of these stations 
we informed the fcc that these stations  like many other stations  were unable to begin digital operations by november due to delays in procuring and installing necessary equipment 
we have informed the fcc that we expect to construct our digital facilities for these stations by the end of the second quarter of with respect to the other three stations  we have applications pending for dtv construction permits and the fcc has granted us special temporary authority for two of these stations to begin digital operations prior to grant of the construction permit 
during the transition period  each existing analog television station will be permitted to operate a second station that will broadcast using the digital standard 
after completion of the transition period  the fcc will reclaim the non digital channels 
there is considerable uncertainty about the final form of the fcc digital regulations 
even so  we believe that these new developments may have the following effects on us signal quality issues 
our tests have indicated that the digital standard mandated by the fcc  level vestigial sideband vsb  is currently unable to provide for reliable reception of a dtv signal through a simple indoor antenna 
absent improvements in dtv receivers  or an fcc ruling allowing us to use an alternative standard  continued reliance on the vsb digital standard may not allow us to provide the same reception coverage with our digital signals as we can with our current analog signals 
additionally  because of this poor reception quality and coverage  we may be forced to rely on cable television or other alterative means of transmission to deliver our digital signals to all of the viewers we are able to reach with our current analog signals 
reclamation of analog channels 
congress directed the fcc to begin auctioning analog channels this year and the remaining non digital channels by september   even though the fcc is not to reclaim them until congress further permitted broadcasters to bid on the non digital channels in cities with populations over  if the channels are owned by our competitors  they may exert increased competitive pressure on our operations 
capital and operating costs 
we will incur costs to replace equipment in our stations in order to provide digital television 
some of our stations will also incur increased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations 
we cannot be certain we will be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs 
subscription fees and system compatibility 
the fcc has determined to assess a fee in the amount of of gross revenues on digital television subscription services 
if we are unable to pass this cost through to our subscribers  this fee will reduce our earnings from the digital television subscription services we are planning 
the fcc also is considering whether to require cable systems to carry digital television signals 
under current regulations  cable systems are only required to carry non digital signals 
given this climate of market uncertainty and regulatory change  we cannot be sure what impact the fcc s actions might have on our plans and results in the area of digital television 
federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility 
the fcc regulates our business  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry 
we must ask the fcc s approval whenever we need a new license  seek to renew or assign a license  purchase a new station  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license 
our fcc licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to lmas are critical to our operations  we cannot operate without them 
we cannot be certain that the fcc will renew these licenses in the future  or approve new acquisitions 
federal legislation and fcc rules have changed significantly in recent years 
we anticipate further changes in the rules on digital television 
we discuss some of the possible effects of these changes elsewhere in this k  but we cannot predict all the effects that such changes may have on our business 
the fcc s ownership restrictions limit our ability to operate multiple television stations  and future changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets 
general limitations the fcc s ownership rules limit us from having attributable interests in television stations that reach more than of all television households in the us under the fcc s method for calculating this limit  our television stations will reach approximately of us television households after we complete our pending purchases and sales of stations 
changes in the rules on television ownership and local marketing agreements in  the fcc revised its local television ownership and lma attribution rules 
in the past  a licensee could not own two television stations in a market but could own one station and program another station pursuant to an lma because lmas were not considered attributable interests 
the new television ownership rules allow us to own more than one television station in a market if there is no grade b overlap between the stations  if the stations are in two different nielsen designated market areas  or if the market containing both the stations contains at least eight separately owned full power television stations  and not more than one is among the top four rated stations in the market 
in addition  we may request a waiver of the rule to acquire a second station in the market if the station to be acquired is economically distressed or unbuilt and there is no party who does not own a local television station who would purchase the station for a reasonable price 
we currently program television stations pursuant to lmas 
we have entered into agreements to acquire of the stations that we program pursuant to an lma 
once we acquire these stations  the lmas will terminate 
under the new ownership rules  lmas are now attributable where a licensee owns a television station and programs a television station in the same market 
the new rules provide that lmas entered into on or after november  have until august  to come into compliance with the new ownership rules  otherwise such lmas will terminate 
lmas entered into before november  will be grandfathered until the conclusion of the fcc s biennial review 
in certain cases  parties with grandfathered lmas  may be able to rely on the circumstances at the time the lma was entered into in advancing any proposal for co ownership of the station 
of the remaining stations that we program pursuant to an lma and are not acquiring  lmas were entered into before november   and lmas were entered into on or after november  as a result of these changes  we may be forced to terminate or modify some of our remaining lmas 
terminating or modifying our lmas could affect our business in the following ways losses on investments 
as part of our lma arrangements  we own the non license assets used by the stations with which we have lmas 
if lma arrangements are no longer permitted  we would be forced to sell these assets  or find another use for them 
if lmas are prohibited  the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or a purchaser of the related license assets 
therefore  we cannot be certain we will recoup our investments 
termination penalties 
if the fcc requires us to modify or terminate existing lmas before the terms of the lmas expire  we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our lmas 
the fcc requires the owner licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station 
as a result  the owners licensees of the stations with which we have lmas can exert their control in ways that may be counter to our interests  including the right to preempt programming or terminate in certain instances 
these preemption and termination rights cause us some uncertainty that we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased  and therefore uncertainty about the advertising revenues we will receive from such programming 
failure of owner licensee to exercise control 
in addition  if the fcc determines that the owner licensee is not exercising sufficient control  it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine  revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of the license 
any one of these scenarios might affect our financial results  especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license 
in addition  penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold fcc licenses  and thus place those licenses at risk 
we have lost money in three of the last four years  and expect to continue to do so indefinitely 
we have suffered net losses in three of the last five years 
in  we reported earnings  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations and recognition of an unrealized gain on a derivative instrument 
our losses are due to the following significant cash and non cash expenses o cash expenses interest o non cash expenses depreciation  amortization primarily of programming and intangibles  and deferred compensation 
we expect our net losses to continue indefinitely for the same reasons 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we enter into interest rate derivative hedging agreements 
we have entered into an additional derivative instrument to monetize the benefit of a call option on a portion of our outstanding indebtedness at interest rates prevailing at the time we entered into the instrument 
this derivative instrument the treasury option derivative instrument exposes us to market risk from a further decrease in interest rates  but we believe that this risk is offset by the benefit to us from reduced interest rate expense on a portion of our floating rate debt and the ability to call some of our indebtedness and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing interest rates 
finally  we have entered put and call option derivative instruments relating to our class a common stock in order to hedge against the possible dilutive effects of employees exercising stock options pursuant to our stock option plans 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
with the exception of our treasury option derivative instrument described below  we do not reflect the changes in fair market value related to derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements 
interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which arises from the floating rate debt 
as of december   we were obligated on billion of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt 
the bank credit agreement  as amended and restated  requires us to enter into interest rate protection agreements at rates not to exceed per annum as to a notional principal amount at least equal to of the term loan  revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to time 
as of december   we had several interest rate swap agreements which expire from july  to july  the swap agreements effectively set fixed rates on our floating rate debt in the range of to 
floating interest rates are based upon the three month london interbank offered rate libor  and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
settlements of these agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods 
the notional amounts related to these agreements were billion at december   and decrease to million through the expiration dates 
in addition  we entered into floating rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million 
based on our currently hedged position  billion or of our outstanding indebtedness is hedged 
based on our debt levels and the amount of floating rate debt not hedged as of march   a increase in the libor rate would result in an increase in annualized interest expense of approximately million 
treasury option derivative instrument in august  we entered into a treasury option derivative contract 
the option derivative contract provides for an option exercise date of september   a notional amount of million and a five year treasury strike rate of 
if the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities is less than the strike rate on the option exercise date  we would be obligated to pay five consecutive annual payments in an amount equal to the strike rate less the five year treasury rate multiplied by the notional amount beginning september  through september  if the interest rate yield on five year treasuries at september  were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on december  for treasuries settled on september   we would not be required to make payments 
upon the execution of the option derivative contract  we received a cash payment representing an option premium of million which was recorded in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to periodically adjust our liability to the present value of the future payments of the settlement amounts based on the forward five year treasury rate at the end of an accounting period 
the fair market value adjustment for resulted in an income statement benefit unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  if the yield on five year treasuries at september  were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on december   we would not be required to make payments 
we have the ability to call our senior subordinated notes due on september  the value of this call is determined by new issuance yields for senior subordinated debt at that time 
the value of this call rises when yields fall and falls when yields rise 
new issuance yields are based on a spread over treasury yields 
if the yield on five year treasuries remains below until september   we expect to be able to call those notes and refinance at the lower prevailing rates  thus offsetting the effect of the payments required under the treasury option derivative 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be able to refinance the notes at such time at favorable interest rates 
we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we have senior subordinated notes totaling million and million expiring in the years and  respectively 
based upon the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes was million as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately million as of december  equity put option derivatives we are exposed to market risk relating to our equity put option derivative instruments 
the contract terms relating to these instruments provide for settlement on the expiration date 
the equity puts require us to make a settlement payment to the counterparties to these contracts payable in either cash or shares of our class a common stock in an amount that is approximately equal to the put strike price minus the price of our class a common stock as of the termination date 
if the put strike price is less than the price of our class a common stock as of the termination date  we would not be obligated to make a settlement payment 
in addition  certain of these contracts include terms allowing the put option to become immediately exercisable upon our class a common stock trading at certain levels 
the following table summarizes our position relating to the equity puts and illustrates the market risk associated with these instruments 
december  equity put put termination trigger settlement sensitivity settlement options outstanding strike price date price a assuming termination b assuming termination c  january     d july     june     e march    a if our class a common stock reaches a market price equal to trigger price  the equity put options will become immediately exercisable

c this column represents the settlement costs that would be incurred payable in either cash or shares of our class a common stock if equity put options were terminated on december  and assuming a market price of the closing price on march  minus 
d the settlement of these equity put options is limited to a maximum of per option outstanding  or  e this equity put option agreement was subsequently amended 
effective march  there are million equity put options outstanding at a put strike price of terminating june
