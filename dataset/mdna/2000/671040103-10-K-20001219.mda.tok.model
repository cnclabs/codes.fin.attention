item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in march  we have devoted our resources to the development of our technology platform and research and drug discovery programs 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs have resulted in a commercial product  and therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products by us or by our collaborators 
furthermore  we do not expect to generate any such revenues for several years  if at all 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of september  and expect to continue to incur operating losses for several years 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities and payments under collaborative research agreements with major pharmaceutical companies 
historically  we have conducted most of our drug discovery programs through funded collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies 
these arrangements have typically included milestone and royalty payments on the successful development and marketing of products discovered in the collaborations 
using this business model  we have been able to leverage the research  development and financial resources of our corporate partners to help build and sustain a large pipeline of product opportunities supplemented by those within our own proprietary programs 
more recently  as we have generated the financial resources to invest more fully in our own programs  we have begun a transition away from a partner funded alliance model in favor of osi owned and sponsored drug candidates 
we intend to develop our own drug candidates through the early stages of clinical development prior to entering into co development and commercialization agreements with leading pharmaceutical companies in return for a greater share of the revenues derived from product sales 
the most advanced of our product candidates is osi  which has been shown to be active and well tolerated as a monotherapy in three ongoing open label  phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of non small cell lung  ovarian and head and neck cancers 
we have an additional candidate in clinical trials and nine candidates in late stage pre clinical development 
the importance of this new class of drugs led to an antitrust finding by the us federal trade commission in june during its investigation of pfizer inc s merger with warner lambert and the return of all rights to osi to us 
revenues total revenues of million in fiscal increased approximately million or compared to fiscal  and total revenues of million in fiscal increased approximately million or compared to fiscal collaborative research and development agreements with pfizer  anaderm  tanabe  aventis  sankyo  solvay  fujirebio  bayer  and helicon therapeutics  inc accounted for substantially all of our collaborative program revenues 
total collaborative program revenues of approximately million in fiscal increased approximately million or compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased funding for the pfizer anaderm program for the discovery and development of cosmeceuticals  funding from a research agreement with solvay assumed by us on july  with the acquisition of certain assets from cadus pharmaceutical corporation  and funding associated with a collaborative research agreement with tanabe initiated on october  increases in collaborative program revenues for fiscal were partially offset by the termination of the diagnostics collaboration with bayer upon the sale of diagnostics business to bayer in november  and  to lesser extents  the reduction in funding under the extended collaboration agreement with sankyo and the conclusion of our funded collaborative research agreement with helicon in june total collaborative program revenues of approximately million in fiscal increased approximately million or compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the expansion of the pfizer anaderm program as of april and the initiation of the research agreement with solvay 
collaborative program revenues were partially offset by the conclusion in october of one of our funded collaborative programs with aventis relating to the discovery and development of orally active drugs for the treatment of chronic anemia 
we recognized a technology access fee of million in october from tanabe in conjunction with the new collaborative research agreement as discussed in notes b and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sales of products and services derived from pharmaceutical services of our uk subsidiary  osi uk  and from diagnostics sales of our us subsidiary  osdi  inc  or osdi formerly known as oncogene science diagnostics  inc  decreased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to a shift in focus of pharmaceutical services from external sales to internal programs and to the sale of our diagnostics assets to bayer in november additionally  we are currently in the process of winding down our external sales from pharmaceutical services in order to focus entirely on our internal programs 
sales of products and services in fiscal increased approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the growth in sales of the company s diagnostic products 
other research revenues  representing primarily government grants and other research grants  decreased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases were related to a reduction in the number of government grant applications submitted as we narrowed our grant program efforts to our disease areas of focus in order to more fully leverage our resources 
license revenues decreased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the receipt of a license fee of million from a license agreement with biochem pharma  inc in march which replaced an earlier collaborative program focused on anti viral drug discovery 
license revenues for fiscal consisted of a patent license fee of  paid by one licensee and  of maintenance fees from three other licensees 
license revenues increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily related to the aforementioned million license fee 
during fiscal  we recognized license revenues of approximately  from the signing of a license agreement with aurora biosciences corporation covering our gene transcription patent estate 
expenses operating expenses increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was related to i our expanded collaboration with anaderm  ii our increased investment in proprietary drug discovery programs  including gpcr directed drug discovery programs which were included in the cadus asset acquisition  iii the initiation of the agreement with tanabe and related costs  iv the initiation of clinical development of osi  and v certain non cash  stock option based compensation charges as discussed below 
on august   the board of directors granted non qualified stock options to purchase up to  common shares to our new president and head of research and development 
the terms of this grant provided for an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to of the fair market value on the grant date vesting immediately upon his employment date on september  ie the measurement date  and an option to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the grant date vesting one third in a year from the measurement date and monthly thereafter for twenty four months 
the granting of the options at of fair market value resulted in a compensation charge of approximately million 
the granting of the other options resulted in deferred compensation of approximately million which will be recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
in addition  stock options granted to non employees in connection with their consulting arrangements resulted in compensation expense recognized in fiscal of approximately million and deferred compensation of million as of september  in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods related to the non employee grants is subject to change each reporting period based upon the then fair value of these options  using a black scholes option pricing model  until expiration of the grant vesting period 
we expect to continue to increase investment in our proprietary drug discovery programs  in particular development of osi  for which we received a royalty free license to all rights for its further development  as more fully described under liquidity and capital resources 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the cadus asset acquisition on july  we recorded a charge of  for in process research and development acquired in connection with the cadus asset acquisition 
also contributing to the increase was the continued expansion of our collaboration with anaderm 
we also expanded our medicinal chemistry facility at our osi uk subsidiary to accommodate the increased chemistry efforts required in the expanded anaderm collaboration 
these costs were somewhat offset by the conclusion in october of our funded collaborative program with aventis relating to the discovery and development of orally active drugs for the treatment of chronic anemia 
production and service costs decreased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was related to the sale of our diagnostics business  including the assets of osdi  to bayer on november  the increase in fiscal was related to increased investment in developing osdi 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased approximately  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily related to the increased business development costs associated with osi and other corporate development activity during the fiscal year 
in addition  we incurred increased administration expenses associated with the acquired operation in tarrytown  new york from the cadus asset acquisition  and the expansion of the chemistry facility at osi uk 
during fiscal  we made the strategic decision to close down our facilities in north carolina and consolidate the natural products operations into our tarrytown facility in new york 
the estimated cost of closing this facility of approximately  was accrued as of september   and was included in research and development expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in fiscal amortization of intangibles in fiscal decreased approximately  or 
the decrease was related to the inclusion of our diagnostic patent estate in the sale of the diagnostics business to bayer  which eliminated the related amortization expense effective november  amortization of intangibles in fiscal and represented primarily amortization of patents that resulted from the acquisition of the diagnostics business in fiscal and goodwill from the acquisition of osi uk in fiscal other income and expense net investment income increased approximately million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was largely due to investment of funds generated from i a private placement of our common stock  ii the exercise of options and warrants  and iii sale of the diagnostics business unit in november these financing activities are more fully explained in liquidity and capital resources below 
the decrease in fiscal was a result of the decline in principal balance invested offset by a gain of approximately  from the sale of  shares of aurora biosciences common stock 
other income in fiscal includes the gain recognized on the sale of anaderm common stock 
on september   we exercised our right and sold to pfizer all of our shares of common stock in anaderm for approximately million 
the sale  net of the carrying value of the investment  resulted in a gain of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources at september   working capital  representing primarily cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  aggregated approximately million compared to million at september  this increase resulted primarily from i the closing of a private placement of  shares of common stock in february  for net proceeds of approximately million  ii the exercise of options and warrants net of a subsequent purchase by the company of shares issued upon the exercise of the warrants for approximately million shares of common stock by management and employees during the fiscal year  for net proceeds of approximately million  and iii the sale of our diagnostics business in november  for cash proceeds of approximately million 
in june  we received a license to develop and market osi from pfizer 
prior to this acquisition  our strategic plan had been focused on increasing investment in our own drug development programs and seeking an opportunity to license rights to a drug candidate from another company for development by us 
as a result of obtaining the license to osi  the preceding goal for in licensing a clinical development candidate from another company has been superceded 
we expect our cash burn will increase significantly during fiscal as a result of osi  up to approximately million 
we are currently seeking a co development and marketing partnership with a major pharmaceutical company to maximize the healthcare benefit and commercialization of osi while maintaining a significant economic interest in the product 
on november   subsequent to the end of fiscal  we concluded a public offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million after all related fees are included 
in addition  on november   underwriters associated with this offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option totaled million with net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that the proceeds from this offering together with existing cash resources and projected funding from collaborative research and development programs will be sufficient to fund the operations and capital requirements for at least the next seven years 
we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years as we increase our investment in osi and other internal proprietary programs 
additionally  as we shift our focus toward internal drug development  we expect collaborative revenues to decrease in the future 
the funded phase of our collaboration with aventis ended on september  also  we do not expect the funded phase of our cancer collaboration with pfizer to renew beyond its scheduled termination of april  to achieve profitability  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop and commercialize our technologies and products  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and obtain adequate assistance to successfully manufacture  introduce and market such technologies and products 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain 
during fiscal  we recently received a commitment from the state of new york to expand and refurbish a state of the art discovery research and headquarters facility located in the broad hollow bioscience park on the suny campus in farmingdale  new york  which we will lease from the state 
we expect to move our headquarters and uniondale research operations to this new facility by the end of with this additional available space  we believe that our facilities will be adequate to meet our current requirements 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
sab no 
provides the sec staff s views on the recognition of revenue including nonrefundable technology access fees received by biotechnology companies in connection with research collaborations with third parties 
sab no 
states that in certain circumstances the sec staff believes that up front fees  even if nonrefundable  should be deferred and recognized systematically over the term of the research arrangement 
sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
b  requires registrants to adopt the accounting guidance contained therein by no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  fiscal year ending september  for us 
we will report the effect of adopting the provisions of the sab as a change in accounting principle as of october  in accordance with apb opinion no 
rather than retroactively restate prior period financial statements 
we have assessed the financial impact of complying with sab no 
 and we believe that the change in accounting principle will primarily result in the recognition of the technology access fee of  received from tanabe evenly over the term of the collaboration between us and tanabe  that had been previously recognized as revenue in the first quarter of fiscal in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in accordance with sfas  an entity is required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we do not believe that the implementation of sfas will have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in item business and elsewhere in this report that are not historical or current facts deal with potential future circumstances and developments 
the discussion of these matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and these discussions may materially differ from our actual future experience involving any one or more of these matters and subject areas 
these forward looking statements are also subject generally to the other risks and uncertainties that are described in this report in item business cautionary factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in our investment portfolio of debt securities  to the fair value of equity instruments held  and  to an immaterial extent  to foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss included in stockholders equity 
our investments in certain biotechnology companies are carried on the equity method of accounting 
other than temporary losses are recorded against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
it is uncertain whether other than temporary losses will be material to our results of operations in the future 
other than foreign currency exchange rates  we do not currently hedge these exposures 
we hedge some of our foreign currency exchange rates exposure through forward contracts as more fully described in note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
