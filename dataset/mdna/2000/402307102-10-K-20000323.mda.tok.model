item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook the company s results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  north africa  west africa  latin america  and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices  and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment  especially in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in to feet of water and in deepwater to  feet areas of the gulf of mexico 
over the first three of the past five years  generally favorable trends in these factors led to increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
in the past two years  however  the distraction caused by consolidation activity by the oil and gas exploration and production companies and generally unfavorable trends in the exploration and development activity factors have caused a corresponding reduction in the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity 
development activity in water depths greater than feet  where larger structures requiring more steel tonnage are needed  has declined during and has had a negative effect on the demand on the available capacity of the major platform fabricators serving the gulf of mexico  with a resulting decline in pricing levels for their services through the end of demand for the company s products and services has remained low for the past two years 
the resultant low level of backlog of projects  with reduced profit margins  resulted in a weak performance for revenue in was million  a decrease compared to revenue  and net income was million  a decrease compared to net income 
the continued low activity levels in the oil and gas industry is reflected in the company s backlog at december  which was million as compared to million at the end of the dollar value of projects available in the market is significantly below those levels of two to three years ago and the company s backlog is being similarly eroded 
competition for available projects has become more intense and margins may remain low 
cost reduction measures have been instituted to meet these conditions 
in the longer term  demand for the company s services will continue to depend largely upon actual or anticipated prices for oil and gas  which are difficult to predict 
at some point  however  it is expected that demand for the company s products and services should recover as supplies are reduced and the company s customers are forced to replace them 
during  the company s workforce declined from approximately  to employees 
due to recent reduced demand for the company s products and services  the company does not anticipate the need to engage a material amount of contract labor in the foreseeable future 
most of the company s revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours worked to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
year issues in prior years  the company discussed the nature and progress of its plans to become year ready 
in late  the company completed its remediation and testing of systems 
as a result of those planning and implementation efforts  the company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical information technology and non information technology systems and believes those systems successfully responded to the year date change 
the company expensed approximately  during in connection with remediating its systems 
the company is not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with its products  its internal systems  or the products and services of third parties 
the company will continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its suppliers and vendors throughout the year to ensure that any latent year matters that may arise are addressed promptly
