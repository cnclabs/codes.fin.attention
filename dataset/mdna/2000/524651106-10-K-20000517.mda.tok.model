results of operations overview on january   we announced that we would be restating results for the third quarter of to reflect an adjustment concerning one contract that decreased revenue in the third quarter from million to million  this agreement has been subsequently terminated 
on march   we filed a form b with the securities and exchange commission stating that we were unable to file our form k within the prescribed period because  as a result of our regular first quarter review that included a review of past due accounts receivables  including certain fourth quarter transactions for which payment was due  we discovered additional information that related to such transactions and requested our independent auditors to evaluate such transactions in light of this additional information 
on april   we announced that we discovered that a number of our sales representatives  acting outside their authority  had entered into side agreements affecting contracts signed with resellers in the fourth quarter 
these side agreements supplemented the contractual arrangements for sales transactions with these resellers by making payment to us contingent on sale by the reseller 
as a result  we delayed filing of our k pending conclusion of our review of these matters 
we also announced that we believed our revenue for the first quarter ended march  would be in the range of million to million  and that we expected to release complete financial results and provide additional information relating to the first quarter on april  on april   our board of directors appointed a special investigation committee of the board composed of two outside directors  messrs 
bingham and strohm  to investigate  with the assistance of outside counsel  the nature and extent of the side agreements and our revenue recognition practices 
on april   we announced that although we had previously anticipated that we would file our form k by april  we would be delaying the filing of our form k pending completion of the evaluation of transactions throughout fiscal we also announced that  as a result of our ongoing investigation  we would delay the release of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal until we had filed our form k 
during its investigation  the committee discovered certain facts indicating that a number of our sales representatives  acting outside their authority  had entered into additional unauthorized written and oral agreements outside our standard contractual terms with certain of our resellers 
these side agreements allowed the resellers to pay us only when they were paid by end users  to return product in the event that a sale to an end user was not consummated  or to pay us on extended terms 
if the existence of these side agreements had been known at the time that the transactions were signed  we would not have recognized revenue on these transactions in the period in which they were initially recorded as the fees involved would not have been deemed to be fixed or determinable 
accordingly  we have revised the revenue recognition for all transactions with these resellers during fiscal to reflect the point in time when these fees were considered fixed or determinable which coincided with the receipt of payments from these resellers 
the results of our review of the transactions in were such that we concluded that the problems surrounding unauthorized written and oral agreements did not extend into earlier years 
as a result of the revisions discussed above  we will restate our revenues and results of operations for the quarters ended september   june  and march  and will revise our results for the quarter ended december  previously announced on january  the effect of these adjustments is a decrease in revenue of million and a decrease in net income of million for the year ended december  we develop  market and support network storage management software products for heterogeneous client server computing environments and large scale enterprises 
our data protection products  primarily the networker family of software products  from which we derive a substantial majority of our revenue  and our data availability products primarily our ha  octopus  replication and cluster products  support many storage management server platforms and can accommodate a variety of servers  clients  applications  databases and storage devices 
we license our products through resellers and directly to end users primarily located in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we also license our source code to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  in exchange for initial licensing fees and receive ongoing royalties from the oems product sales 
substantially all of the oems are large computer system and software suppliers located in the united states  europe and asia pacific 
we acquired software moguls  inc in august and fulltime in april  primarily for their product offerings and research and development teams 
we accounted for the acquisitions as poolings of interests 
accordingly  we restated the financial statements to represent the combined financial results of previously separate entities for all periods presented 
selected elements of our consolidated financial statements are shown below for the last three years as a percentage of total revenue and as a percentage change from year to year 
increase of total revenue decrease for years ended december  compared compared to to revenue product license service and support royalty other products total revenue cost of revenue product license service and support other products total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangibles  merger related expenses in process research and development total operating expenses income from operations interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue total revenue was million in  million in and million in total revenue increased percent from to and percent from to total revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued acceptance of our networker family of products  increased sales of service and support contracts  as well as increased royalty revenue 
product license revenue 
product license revenue was million in  million in and million in product license revenue increased percent from to and percent from to product license revenue increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products 
product license revenue also increased as a result of increased product sales to large scale enterprises 
the increase in our number of sales and marketing personnel  as well as sales and marketing programs helped to increase the market acceptance of our products and product sales 
our sales and marketing personnel increased from employees in to employees in we recognize product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable  except for sales to domestic distributors and certain value added resellers for we recognize revenue from domestic distributors upon sale by the distributor since these distributors have unlimited rights of return and we historically have not been able to make reasonable estimates of product returns for these distributors 
we also incur additional internal costs to assist our distributors in selling our products to end users 
for transactions entered into with those resellers where we have determined that fees were not fixed or determinable due to circumstances involving unauthorized written and oral agreements outside our normal contractual terms  as discussed in note  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
a total of million has been billed to those resellers for transactions entered into in and for which products have been delivered but for which the receivable and revenue has not been recognized 
for certain sales where the licensing fee is not due until the customer deploys the software  revenue is recognized when the customer reports to us that the software has been deployed 
prior growth rates of our product license revenue are not indicative of future product license revenue growth rates and may not be sustainable in the future 
service and support revenue 
service and support revenue was million in  million in and million in service and support revenue increased percent from to and percent from to service and support revenue increased primarily as a result of the growth in the number of registered customers electing to subscribe to support contracts and to renew software support contracts after the initial one year term 
our increase in internal staffing for software support helped to increase new sales and renewals of our software support contracts 
our increase in internal staffing for education and consulting services resulted in increased sales of the education and consulting services we offer 
our technical support personnel increased from employees in to employees in our consulting and education services personnel increased from employees in to employees in we collect fees for ongoing customer support and product updates in advance and recognize this support revenue ratably over the period of the contract 
for education and consulting services  we recognize revenue as such services are performed 
prior growth rates of our software service and support revenue are not indicative of future software service and support revenue growth rates and may not be sustainable in the future 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue was million in  million in and million in royalty revenue increased percent from to and percent from to the increase in royalty revenue is attributed to increased product sales by oems  including new oem partners from our acquisition of vinca in july royalty revenues are recognized upon receipt of quarterly royalty reports from oems related to their product sales for the previous quarter 
prior growth rates of our royalty revenue are not indicative of future royalty revenue growth rates and may not be sustainable in the future 
other product revenue 
revenue from sales of other products was million in  million in and million in other product revenue decreased percent from to and percent from to other product revenue represented less than percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in other product revenue consists primarily of third party ancillary hardware and software products for distributed computing systems that are resold by qualix direct  the telesales organization of fulltime  acquired in april the decrease in other revenue is primarily attributable to the continued focus on sales of internally developed software products rather than third party products sold through qualix direct 
international product license revenue accounted for percent of total revenue in and and percent in international license revenue in absolute dollars increased primarily as a result of the continued market acceptance of our products overseas 
an increase in the number of international sales offices and international distributors and resellers marketing our products helped increase the market acceptance of our products overseas 
the majority of international sales during these periods were made in europe and canada 
to date  we have established foreign offices in the following countries 
australia  
belgium  
canada  
china  
france  
germany  
japan  
italy  
netherlands  
poland  
singapore  
sweden  
switzerland  and 
united kingdom 
we believe that our continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of our international operations 
in order to successfully expand international sales in and subsequent periods  we must continue to establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel for these operations and recruit additional international resellers 
expansion and management of our international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources and could seriously harm certain operating results if such efforts are not successful 
to the extent that we are unable to effect these additions in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in international revenue will be limited  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those markets 
in some markets  localization of our products is essential to achieve market penetration 
we may incur substantial costs and experience delays in localizing our products  and we cannot guarantee that any localized product will ever generate significant revenue 
gross profit gross profit was million in  million in and million in  representing percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in gross profit consists of product license  service and support and other product revenue less related costs 
gross profit from product license revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing percent of product license revenue in  percent in and percent in gross profit from product license revenue increased percent from to and percent from to gross profit from product license revenue consists of product license revenue less the related costs 
related costs of revenue consist primarily of product media  documentation and packaging 
gross profit from product license revenue as a percentage of product license revenue increased primarily as a result leveraging the costs of sales over a higher product license revenue base 
gross profit from service and support revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing percent of the service and support revenue in  percent in and percent in gross profit from service and support revenue increased percent from to and percent from to the continued investment consists of additional costs associated with supporting a larger installed base of products  as well as costs to provide higher support levels to customers 
costs of service and support revenue consist primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing telephone support  consulting services  and training to customers  costs of providing software updates and costs of education and consulting materials 
gross profit from other product revenue was million in  million in and million in  representing percent of other product revenue in and and percent in gross profit from other product revenue decreased percent from to and percent from to gross profit from other product revenue decreased in absolute dollars primarily as a result of fulltime s continued focus on sales of internally developed software products rather than third party products sold through qualix direct telesales organization prior to our acquisition in april operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in research and development expenses increased percent from to and percent from to the increases in research and development expenses primarily reflect increased staffing and associated support for engineers necessary to expand and enhance our product line 
the number of research and development personnel increased from employees in to employees in research and development expenses  in absolute dollars  increased primarily as a result of our continuing efforts to invest in developing new products  applications and product enhancements 
we believe that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in developing new products and enhancing existing products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in sales and marketing expenses increased percent from to and percent from to the increases in sales and marketing expenses  in absolute dollars  were primarily attributable to the growth of our sales force and associated support personnel from employees in to employees in sales and marketing expenses also increased from to as a result of additional marketing and promotional activities to increase awareness of our products 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our finance  human resources  facilities  information systems and other administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in  representing percent of total revenue in  percent in and percent in general and administrative expenses increased percent from to and percent from to the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was attributable to leveraging general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
the increases in absolute dollars of general and administrative expenses from to were primarily attributable to increased staffing and related costs required to manage and support our expansion 
general and administrative personnel increased from employees in to employees in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount as we continue to expand our operations 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million in and million in and during  we recorded additional intangibles related to the acquisitions of intelliguard totaling million and vinca totaling million see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are amortizing these intangibles on a straight line basis over periods ranging from seventeen months to five years from the dates of acquisition resulting in additional amortization of million in merger and acquisition related expenses 
in connection with the our acquisitions of fulltime during the second quarter of and software moguls  inc during the third quarter of  both accounted for as poolings of interests  we incurred merger related expenses of million and  respectively  consisting primarily of investment bankers  attorneys and accountants fees and costs relating to closure of duplicative facilities and severance costs 
in addition  during  we incurred million in expenses  consisting primarily of investment bankers  attorneys and accountants fees  in connection with our proposed acquisition of ontrack data international  inc during the fourth quarter of in january  we entered into a mutual termination agreement with ontrack data international  inc to immediately terminate the proposed acquisition 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisitions of intelliguard during the second quarter of and vinca during the third quarter of  we incurred purchased in process research and development costs of million and million  respectively  during during and  we did not incur any purchased in process research and development costs 
the fair value of intelliguard s and vinca s core technologies  existing products  as well as the technology currently under development were determined by independent appraisers using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward by a premium of for the in process projects from the intelliguard acquisition and to for the in process projects from vinca acquisition to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
we expect that the pricing models related to these acquisitions will be considered standard within the high technology industry 
however  we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include anticipated cost savings 
the intelliguard projects included in in process research and development and the percent complete  the estimated cost to complete and the value assigned to each project follows in thousands estimate percent estimated cost value project completion to complete assigned a b  c total purchased in process research and development  the vinca projects included in in process research and development and the percent complete  the estimated cost to complete and the value assigned to each project as follows in thousands estimate estimated percent cost to value project completion complete assigned a b c  d  e  f  g  h  i  total purchased in process research and development  depending on the project  we expect that products incorporating the acquired technology will be completed and begin to generate cash flows within six months to twenty four months after the time of the acquisitions 
however  development of these technologies remains a significant risk to legato due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
the nature of efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to determine that the product can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time of the acquisition and potentially result in impairment of any other assets related to the development activities 
interest income  net interest income  net  was million in interest income  net  was million in and million in the increase in interest income relates primarily to interest earned from the increased cash balances 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in  with an effective rate of percent in  percent in and percent in the increase in the effective tax rate from to was primarily attributable to the impact of non deductible merger and amortization expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions of fulltime  intelliguard and vinca during the decrease in the effective rate from to was primarily attributable to the acquisition of software moguls  inc which was an s corporation for income tax purposes  and  therefore  did not record a provision for or benefit from income taxes 
rather  income tax attributes of these losses were used by software moguls  inc shareholders 
if the losses of software moguls  inc  had been reflected in our financial statements in  the effective tax rate would have been percent 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million at december  and represented percent of total assets 
cash and cash equivalents increased million during cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities or remaining maturities at the date of purchase of ninety days or less 
investments consist mainly of short term and long term municipal  us agency securities and auction rate receipts 
at december   we had no long term debt and stockholders equity was million 
we have financed our operations to date primarily by cash from operations and sales of common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided from operations in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million  depreciation and amortization of million  write off of purchased in process research and development costs of million and provisions for sales returns of million  offset by a change in operating assets and liabilities of million and by million attributable to the change in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided from operations in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million  depreciation and amortization of million and the change in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by million attributable to the change in deferred taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash provided from operations in consisted primarily of net income of million plus the tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million and depreciation and amortization of million  offset by the change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
accounts payables increased in primarily as a result of increased purchasing commitments to support our growth 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased during and because of increased purchases to support the growth in our operations 
accrued compensation and benefits increased during  and primarily as a result of the continued growth in the number of employees worldwide 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue increased during  and  because of increasing sales of our product licenses as well as service and support contracts 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in during and  the net cash used in investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment 
in  investing activities also consisted of net payments of million for the purchases of intelliguard and vinca as well as a million investment in a closely held private company 
purchases of property and equipment increased during  and to support the growth in our operations 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds received from the issuance of our common stock 
during  we received million in connection with the sale of one qualifying accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
however  subsequent to year end  the agreement and related receivable was cancelled 
as a result  the proceeds received have been presented as a financing activity rather than cash from operating activities 
we believe our current cash balances and cash flow from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products include coding to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
some uncertainty existed in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such problems  although much of that uncertainty has now been allayed following the roll over of the year the risks posed by year issues could adversely affect our business in a number of significant ways 
we believe after examining and testing our products that our internally developed technology  as well as the third party technology incorporated into our products  is year compliant 
moreover  to date  we have not detected any disruptions in our software applications or in the applications of our vendors arising from the roll over to the year nonetheless  our products could experience unexpected year issues that we have failed to uncover to date  which could cause our products to be impaired 
we also use third party financial and other systems in our internal business operations 
to our knowledge  these products have not experienced year disruptions following the roll over to the year nonetheless these systems could suffer from unexpected year issues 
any such year issues could materially adversely affect our business 
moreover  we may in the future be required to defend our products or services in litigation or arbitration proceedings involving our products or services related to year compliance issues  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
defending or resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability we have for year related damages  including consequential damages  could be expensive 
financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could seriously harm our financial results 
substantially all of our international sales are currently denominated in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore  reduce the demand for our products 
reduced demand for our products could seriously harm our financial results 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
our investment portfolio consists of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
these securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could seriously harm the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures

 or sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the statement of financial position  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income loss  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities

these paragraphs of sop and sop were effective for transactions that were entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  retroactive application is prohibited 
the effect of the adoption was not material 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no
