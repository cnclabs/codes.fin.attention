item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general napro is a natural product pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development  manufacture and commercialization of cancer chemotherapeutic agents and related technologies 
natural product substances have been  and continue to be  the primary source of new chemotherapeutic anti cancer agents  especially compounds which exert their anti cancer activity by novel mechanisms of action 
napro s lead product is paclitaxel  a naturally occurring chemotherapeutic anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew taxus trees 
in addition to its efforts with paclitaxel  napro is actively engaged in evaluating the in licensing or purchase of potential new products and or technologies  either derived from natural products or otherwise 
such evaluations may involve individual molecules  classes of compounds or platform technologies  both in the cancer field and otherwise  which could involve the acquisition of entire private or publicly traded companies 
napro is also working internally on several classes of compounds which have promising in vitro and in vivo activity as anti tumor agents that function by new and novel mechanisms that may increase the likelihood of their success as new chemotherapeutic agents 
napro has terminated discussions for the licensing of certain technology that were reported in its form b filed with the securities and exchange commission on march  napro is in active discussions with others and remains committed to the diversification of its business through the acquisition and development of new products and compounds 
regarding paclitaxel  napro has devoted its efforts to the development and implementation of its propriety extraction  isolation and purification eip tm technology and the development of its proprietary semisynthetic method for producing napro paclitaxel 
to advance the development and commercializa tion of napro paclitaxel  napro is party to year  exclusive agreements with abbott laboratories abbott and fh faulding co  ltd 
faulding for the clinical development  sales  marketing and distribution of napro paclitaxel 
although napro has increased sales through december   napro continues to incur substantial expense for research and development related to clinical trials  improving manufacturing processes and other development activity 
accordingly  napro has incurred significant operating losses  including operating losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  napro expects that it will continue to have a high level of operating expense and will be required to make significant up front expenditures in connection with its biomass procurement  product development and research and development activities 
napro anticipates that operating losses will continue until such time  if ever  as napro is able to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations 
primarily  the ability of napro to generate sufficient revenue to support its operations depends upon the successful completion of a joint drug development program with abbott  a new drug application nda filing  and regulatory and marketing approval by the us food and drug administration fda followed by abbott s successful marketing of the product 
in addition to the napro abbott drug development program efforts  napro is actively searching for other partners to facilitate the marketing of its product in major markets outside the united states 
in february  bristol myers squibb company bristol submitted a supplemental new drug application with orphan drug designation for paclitaxel for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma ks ahead of the filing by ivax of an nda for the same indication 
the bristol application was approved by the fda in august under the orphan drug act of  this approval resulted in ivax napro being denied marketing approval for the ks indication for seven years 
in february  due to the delay in receiving marketing approval for paclitaxel  napro underwent a restructuring to decrease overall cost and announced the layoff of employees that resulted in a one time charge of approximately  as part of this restructuring  napro discontinued operations at its british columbia manufacturing facility and suspended construction of its commercial scale manufacturing facility in boulder  colorado 
completion of the boulder facility will require additional financing  which napro intends to seek at such time as napro anticipates sufficient product demand to warrant completion of the facility 
napro incurred  of losses on asset retirements and  of other expense as a result of the suspended construction 
in march  napro and ivax corporation ivax terminated the marketing arrangement which had previously been in place between the two companies 
on july   napro entered into a collaborative agreement of up to years the abbott agreement with abbott to develop and commercialize one or more formulations of paclitaxel for the treatment of a variety of cancer indications 
the exclusive agreement covers the united states and canada 
abbott may terminate the agreement at any time with or without cause 
should abbott terminate without cause  it is obligated to make certain payments to napro 
napro will be responsible for supply of bulk drug and may jointly conduct clinical trials with abbott 
abbott will be responsible for finishing  regulatory filings  marketing and sale of the finished drug product 
napro has licensed its paclitaxel related patents to abbott 
most primary decisions related to the development program will be made by a joint napro abbott development committee 
under the abbott agreement napro and abbott are developing the next phase of pivotal clinical studies on one or more different cancers in a variety of populations 
napro has planned with abbott a drug development program exploring the use of napro s patented formulation of paclitaxel using its patented method of administration 
napro anticipates that information gained in such program will be useful in the filing of a regulatory submission with the fda for napro paclitaxel 
the cost of such program is increasing and will be significant 
napro has received and will  contingent upon successful development of product and achievement of milestones  receive funding from abbott in the form of development and marketing milestone payments  a secured loan and an equity investment 
in  napro received million  consisting of an initial million fee  million from the purchase by abbott of napro common stock at per share  and a million draw down on the secured loan 
contingent upon napro s successful achievement of all development milestones and in addition to the payments received in  napro could receive up to million consisting of million in development fees and up to million for the purchase of million shares of napro common stock 
in addition  napro will have access to up to a total of million under a secured loan arrangement with abbott  including the draws of million 
the loan bears a primary interest rate of and is due in full on the earlier of the second anniversary of the first sale of finished product by abbott to a wholesaler or end user customer following approval of finished product by the fda  the termination of the abbott agreement  or january  the loan is limited to a borrowing base of collateralized assets  recomputed monthly 
substantially all of napro s hard assets are collateralized as security for the loan 
contingent upon receiving regulatory approval and achieving certain commercial sales thresholds over several years  napro may receive additional milestone payments from abbott in the range of zero to million 
no assurance can be given that regulatory approval or sales thresholds will be achieved 
under terms of the abbott agreement  abbott will purchase bulk drug from napro 
once the paclitaxel product is approved and commercialized  abbott will pay a percentage of its net paclitaxel sales to napro  less abbott s payments to napro for purchase of bulk drug 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up million from sales to faulding for were million  up million from the increase was partially due to an increase in the number of countries in which faulding is licensed to sell paclitaxel 
the increase was also partially due to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of napro s strategic partners 
sales to ivax  as a result of the termination agreement  ended in the third quarter 
sales may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including the potential  if any  for commercial sales in the abbott territory  the timing and size of any clinical trials  napro s obtaining additional strategic partners  changes in demand  the level of inventory carried and changes in approved markets 
this variability will continue until stable commercial demand has been established for the product in at least one principal market 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  up by million from the increase resulted primarily from an increase in clinical trial activity and increased cost associated with development of the semisynthetic manufacturing process 
napro s production process is not distinct from its research and development processes 
accordingly  the cost of products sold is included within napro s research and development expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  down  from the decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease of  in legal expense related to european patent litigation  partially offset by increased compensation and increases in retirement plan contributions 
license fee income 
license fees for were million  down million from the amount included million in milestone payments under the abbott agreement 
the remainder of the license fees and all of the license fees were paid under the terms of the ivax termination agreement 
license fees and milestone payments are unusual and may be non recurring 
no further payments are expected under the ivax agreement 
interest income 
interest income for was  down  from the decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall balances of interest bearing investments 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense 
interest and other expense for was  down  from the decrease is primarily attributable to the decreased interest on the senior convertible debt because of the final conversion  partially offset by interest on the abbott loan 
see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales were million  up million from sales to ivax for were million  up  from sales other than to ivax for were million  up  from the increase was due primarily to the timing of product shipments and to inventory fluctuations of napro s strategic partners 
research  development and cost of products sold 
research and development expense and cost of products sold for was million  down by million from the decrease resulted primarily from the benefits of the february restructuring  a decrease in the level of process development and research  and lower production cost 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  up  from the increase was attributable primarily to increases of  in legal expense related to the european patent litigation and  of consulting expense primarily related to the ivax termination agreement  partially offset by a reduction in recruiting and relocation expense 
license fee income 
license fees for were million  up million from all of the license fees were paid under the terms of the ivax termination agreement 
interest income 
interest income for was  up  from the increase was attributable to overall higher interest rates realized on interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest and other expense for was  down million from the decrease was primarily attributable to the non recurrence of the million expense related to the amortization of original issue discount on the senior convertible debt  to decreased interest on the senior convertible debt and to decreased borrowing on equipment financing 
liquidity and capital resources napro s capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   napro had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million as of december  napro has a million secured borrowing arrangement with abbott  of which million had been drawn as of december  therefore  napro does not have the need to carry large balances of cash 
to date  the funding of napro s capital requirements has been dependent primarily on the net proceeds of public offerings of its common stock of approximately million  on private placements of its equity securities of approximately million  on the exercise of warrants and options of million  on net borrowings of million  and on loans and advances from its stockholders and strategic partners 
napro s existing capital  projected sales  and available borrowing under the abbott loan are expected to provide adequate capital to fund its necessary operations and capital expenditures in however  pharmaceutical development is a costly and time consuming process 
napro is actively pursuing additional partners to assist in the development and marketing of its products  and may seek other forms of long term financing should such financing become available on acceptable terms 
napro may in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost of acquiring and developing such resources  and related capital expenditures  may be very large 
as a result  napro may need to attract substantial amounts of capital 
no assurance can be given that napro will be able to do so 
in june  napro privately placed million of senior convertible notes 
the notes bore interest of and were all redeemed or converted into common stock by july interest on the notes was payable in cash or in common stock at napro s option 
in napro issued  shares of common stock in conversion of  principal of the notes  and  shares of common stock in payment of  interest on the notes 
in napro redeemed  in note principal and paid  premium and interest in connection with the redemption 
in napro redeemed  in note principal and paid  premium and interest in connection with the redemption 
in december  napro closed a private placement of  shares of series c senior convertible preferred stock the c preferred for an aggregate issuance price of million 
the c preferred accrued dividends at per year payable in common stock or cash at napro s option 
in  napro issued  shares of common stock in conversion of the c preferred and  shares of common stock in payment of dividends on the c preferred 
by september  all of the c preferred had been redeemed or converted into common stock 
napro exercised its option to redeem million of the c preferred at of the outstanding principal and accrued dividends and interest 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  net cash used by operations of million was offset by investing activity of  and by financing activity of million 
inventory increased  from december  to million at december  the amount of work in progress inventory and finished goods inventory is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of napro s strategic partners and napro s production planning for meeting those needs 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development and launch periods 
capital expenditures napro expended  during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included plantation cost and laboratory equipment 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the cost of manufacturing scale up for paclitaxel  the cost of development of new products  the cost of manufacturing resources for new products  the nature of napro s relationship with its strategic partners  the establishment of additional strategic relationships  the progress of napro s research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and marketing developments  and changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships 
napro may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures should such financing become available on terms acceptable to napro 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   napro had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards if there has been a change of ownership as described in section of the internal revenue code 
such a change of ownership may limit napro s utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards  and could be triggered by sales of securities by napro or its stockholders 
year issue until recently many computer programs used only the last two digits to refer to a year 
such programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could have failed or created erroneous results 
this matter is commonly referred to as the year issue or yk 
napro upgraded several computer programs which had not been yk compliant 
to date napro has incurred no problems caused by yk 
the programs which were upgraded would have been upgraded regardless of yk 
accordingly  napro has incurred no significant expense in becoming yk compliant

such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of napro  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such for ward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following adverse economic and general business conditions  competition from bristol and other existing and new producers of paclitaxel and other drugs  technological advances in cancer treatment and drug development  the ability to obtain rights to technology  the ability to obtain and enforce patents  the ability to obtain raw materials and commercialize manufacturing processes  the effectiveness of napro paclitaxel and other pharmaceuticals developed by napro in treating disease  the results of clinical studies  the results of research and development activities  the ability to purchase or license new products  the successful development of new products  the business abilities and judgment of napro s management and other personnel  the availability of qualified personnel generally  the ability of contract manufacturers to perform adequately under anticipated contracts  changes in and compliance with governmental regulations  the effect of capital market conditions and other factors on capital availability for napro and other biopharmaceutical companies  the ability of abbott and faulding to perform their obligations under their existing agreements with napro  the ability of napro to perform its obligations under its existing agreements with abbott and faulding  the effect on napro s revenue  cash flow and earnings from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  the ability of napro to establish relationships with capable strategic partners to develop and market napro paclitaxel in the territories not covered by the abbott and faulding agreements  and other factors referenced in this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  virtually all of napro s revenue resulted from sales of napro paclitaxel to faulding and ivax 
the final shipment of napro paclitaxel required by the termination agreement was made to ivax during the third quarter of following this final delivery to ivax  and in the absence of sales to another strategic partner  sales of napro paclitaxel to faulding will constitute substantially all of napro s sales revenue in napro anticipates sales to abbott  such sales may be quite limited until such time as napro and abbott obtain approval for commercial sales  if ever 
faulding purchases napro paclitaxel from napro at a price which varies in proportion to the price at which faulding sells napro paclitaxel 
under the faulding agreement  napro is paid a fixed sum for napro paclitaxel supplied for noncommercial uses  and a fixed percentage of faulding s sales price for napro paclitaxel supplied for commercial use 
in march of each year  faulding estimates the sales price it will receive for napro paclitaxel in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  napro determines the price it will charge faulding for napro paclitaxel the unadjusted price 
napro recognizes the corresponding revenue at the time of shipment of napro paclitaxel to faulding  based upon the intended use indicated by faulding on its purchase orders 
however  faulding may or may not use the product in accordance with the original use stated on its purchase orders 
additionally  faulding s actual selling price may differ from the amounts originally budgeted and indicated to napro on its purchase orders 
on or about may   faulding will communicate to napro the final amount and type of sales made during the period beginning on april  and ending on march   and an adjustment will be calculated that may increase or decrease napro s revenue from sales of products to faulding during this period 
faulding s sales are made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sells napro paclitaxel 
as a result  napro s revenue from sales is affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
faulding s largest single market is australia  accounting for approximately of faulding s commercial sales during the period beginning march  and ending march  in the past  fluctuations in various currencies  especially the australian dollar  were a major factor in prior reductions in the unadjusted price 
if changes in foreign currency markets continue to cause a decrease in the price per gram napro receives from faulding  there could be a material adverse effect on napro s earnings and cash flow 
for example  during the period beginning march  and ending march   napro s revenue attributable to sales of napro paclitaxel to be resold commercially by faulding totaled  had there been additional negative pressure on the relevant exchange rates such that the unadjusted price had been reduced by napro s earnings would have been reduced by approximately  and napro would have experienced materially reduced cash flow 
however  while faulding will continue to have a significant impact on napro s revenue  napro s continuation of operations is dependent upon sources other than revenue from faulding 
napro anticipates that its operations will be dependent upon borrowing and equity funding provided by the strategic alliance with abbott 
see item business strategic alliances 
to the extent napro s efforts in developing international markets outside the faulding territories are successful  napro may face similar foreign currency exchange risk as that described above for faulding 
certain statements set forth in item a may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act
