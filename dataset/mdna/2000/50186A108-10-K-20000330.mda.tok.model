investment income was approximately 
million in and 
million in interest expense increased by million in compared to the increase is due primarily to the effect of financing the spinnaker acquisition of the warren assets 
on july   spinnaker industries  inc completed the acquisition of the electrical tape division of tesa tape  inc 
a portion of the purchase price was satisfied by the issuance of  shares  subject to certain adjustments  of spinnaker s class a common stock 
as a result of this issuance  the company recorded a gain on sale of subsidiary stock of million  or million per share after income taxes 
the tax benefit of million  includes federal  state and local taxes and represents an effective rate of versus effective tax rate in the difference in the effective rates is primarily due to the effects of the amortization of goodwill  the state and local income taxes and losses of subsidiaries

accordingly  no cash dividends have been paid since january  and none are expected to be paid in in march  lynch systems completed a project specific line of credit totaling million related to a contract to deliver equipment in substantially all assets of lynch systems are pledged in support of the credit facility 
in addition  the company has guaranteed the full amount of the credit facility and has pledged million of its spinnaker class a common stock as additional collateral 
lynch corporation maintains an active acquisition program and generally finances each acquisition with a significant component of debt 
this acquisition debt contains restrictions on the amount of readily available funds that can be transferred to the parent company from its subsidiaries 
as the result of acquisitions  lynch consolidated  spinnaker and certain acquisition subsidiaries have relatively high debt to equity ratios 
the company has a significant need for resources to fund the operations of the holding company and future growth 
there currently is no credit facility in place at the lynch corporate level  and the company is currently considering various long and short term financing arrangements 
one alternative could be to sell a portion or all of certain investments in operating entities either directly or through an exchangeable debt instrument 
additional debt and or equity financing vehicles at corporate and or subsidiaries are also being considered 
while management expects to obtain adequate financing resources to enable the company to meet its obligations  there is no assurance that such can be readily obtained or at reasonable costs 
the company is exploring all options with respect to spinnaker  including liquifying and monetizing its investment  and searching for ways to provide the company with a more financially visible investment with respect to m tron

this transaction is subject to shareholder ratification at the company s annual meeting 
these funds will be available for general corporate purposes 
year the company had initiated a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue and developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year issue was the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs or programs utilized by vendors to the company that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could have resulted in a major system failure or miscalculation 
the company s year review was performed primarily by internal staff  and in certain operations supplemented by outside consultants 
the principal information technology it systems for the company are sales order entry  shop floor control  inventory control and accounting 
the year may have also impacted various non it systems  including among other things security systems  hvac  elevator systems  and communications systems 
in addition  each of the company s businesses may have been impacted by the year readiness of third party vendors suppliers 
the assessment phase for the company s manufacturing businesses was completed by the th quarter of based upon its identification and assessment efforts  the company determined that certain of its computer and software used in manufacturing and accounting systems required replacement or modification 
such replacements and modifications were completed in the th quarter of the total cost of year remediation was million 
a comprehensive contingency plan had been completed in the th quarter of the assessment  implementation and contingency plans for the company s year program were based on management s estimates and were developed using numerous assumptions of future events  some of which were beyond the company s control 
the company believed that with modifications to existing software and the conversion to new software  the year issue would not pose significant operational problems for the company as a whole 
the company experienced no significant occurrences related to the year issue 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk relating to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amounts of interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments and restricted cash 
the company generally finances the debt portion of the acquisition of long term assets with fixed rate  long term debt 
the company generally maintains the majority of its debt as fixed rate in nature either by borrowing on a fixed long term basis or  on a limited basis  entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management does not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk in the near future  although the strategies may be reevaluated as market conditions dictate 
at december   approximately million  or of the company s long term debt and notes payable bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings for variable rate debt and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that the company s and interest expense would have changed by 
million and 
million  respectively 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
