liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders and repayments of indebtedness  is its share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the percentage leases 
for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of percentage lease revenue  was million and ffo was million 
the lessees obligations under the percentage leases are unsecured 
however  the leases with hilton contain certain covenants including the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to consolidated net worth as defined of the lessee of not more than 
management fees paid to affiliates of hilton are subordinated to the lease payments 
the lessees have limited capital resources  and accordingly  their ability to make lease payments under the percentage leases is substantially dependent on the ability of the lessees to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of the hotels

inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of the lessees to raise room rates 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenue to the extent that it receives percentage rent 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides guidance on revenue recognition 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sab requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until annual specified hurdles have been achieved by the lessee 
during and prior years  the company has recognized contingent rentals throughout the year since it was considered probable that the lessee would exceed the annual specified hurdles 
the company has reviewed the terms of its percentage leases and has determined that the provisions of sab materially impact the company s revenue recognition on an interim basis  effectively deferring the recognition of revenue from its percentage leases from the first and second quarters of the calendar year to the third and fourth quarters 
sab will not impact the company s revenue recognition on an annual basis given that company has only calendar year leases 
sab will have no impact on the company s interim or annual cash flow from its third party lessees  and therefore on its ability to pay dividends 
the company will account for sab as a change in accounting principle effective january  forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  anticipates  expects and words of similar import

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
the company monitors interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as occupancy 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing under our line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately thousand  based on balances outstanding during the year ending december
