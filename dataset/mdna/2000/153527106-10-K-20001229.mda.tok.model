reflects the reclassification of million of charges to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its estimated recoverable value from other charges to cost of goods sold and occupancy for fiscal reflects the reclassification of million of exit related costs incurred during the close down process of various facilities from other charges to selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  central s operations were grouped into three business segments  the lawn and garden branded products business garden products  the pet branded products business pet products and the distribution business distribution 
for fiscal  garden products  pet products and distribution accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of consolidated net sales 
these businesses accounted for income loss from operations before other charges and the allocation of certain corporate costs and eliminations of million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal historically  our lawn and garden distribution operations had a substantial impact on our results of operations 
in response to the expiration of the solaris agreement in september and the discontinuance of our distribution relationship with scotts in september  we have substantially downsized our lawn and garden distribution operations 
on december   central announced that it will reorganize its garden and pet businesses 
under the reorganization  central s garden products and distribution businesses will become one operating unit  while its pet products and distribution businesses will become another operating unit 
garden products and pet products 
branded products businesses  such as garden products and pet products  typically operate with higher margins associated with greater value added activities involved in design  manufacturing  and dedicated marketing and sales functions 
from fiscal to fiscal  net sales  before corporate eliminations  associated with the garden products and pet products segments grew from million to million  with income from operations before other charges and the allocation of certain corporate costs and eliminations of million and million  respectively 
net sales  before corporate eliminations  associated with distribution during this same period declined from million to million  while income loss from operations before other charges and the allocation of certain corporate costs and eliminations decreased from income of million to a loss of million during the same period 
as a result of these trends  we expect our results of operations in fiscal and beyond to be more reflective of our garden products and pet products businesses 
distribution 
from october  to september   distribution sold solaris products nationwide  pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement the solaris agreement 
management believes that the relationship with solaris embodied in the solaris agreement had a substantial impact on our results of operations 
management believes that sales of products purchased from solaris  previously our largest supplier  accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal under the solaris agreement  distribution  in addition to serving as the master agent and master distributor of solaris products  provided a wide range of value added services including logistics  order processing and fulfillment  inventory distribution and merchandising 
however  solaris continued to negotiate its sales prices directly with its direct sales accounts 
as a result of the solaris agreement  a majority of our sales of solaris products were derived from sales to direct sales accounts  whereas in and prior  a majority of our sales of solaris products were made by us as a traditional distributor 
direct accounts were customers to whom central sold solaris and other manufacturers products and performed certain in store services  the extent of these services varied based upon the agreement between the retailer  central and solaris 
central also sold products to these same customers as a traditional distributor 
the services provided to these direct customers were similar in nature to those services performed for all other traditional accounts 
during fiscal  and  distribution s sales to customers designated as direct accounts which also purchased products as traditional accounts  totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately  and  respectively  were made to such customers as direct accounts 
the gross profit generated from sales to customers as direct accounts were similar to the gross profit on similar sized customers to whom the company sold to as traditional accounts 
the solaris agreement required central to be responsible for purchasing  products as a traditional distributor  central was required to maintain significantly higher inventory levels throughout its distribution network to accommodate these expanded sales activities 
in january  pharmacia sold its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup r herbicide products for consumer use to scotts and entered into a separate  long term  exclusive agreement pursuant to which pharmacia continues to make roundup herbicide products for consumer use and scotts markets the products 
beginning october   scotts began to distribute ortho r and roundup r products through a system that involved a combination of distributors  of which we were the largest  as well as through direct sales by scotts to certain major retailers 
in addition  scotts began to sell miracle gro r directly to certain retailers 
effective september   scotts discontinued its distribution relationship with central 
the affected products included scotts r  ortho r and miracle gro r products and consumer roundup r products manufactured by pharmacia for which scotts acts as pharmacia s exclusive sales agent 
for central s fiscal year ended september   the revenue attributable to the affected products was approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was estimated to be million based on historical customer profitability 
we expect this loss of gross profit to be partially offset in fiscal with expense reductions 
due to the termination of the scotts distribution relationship  we have taken actions to downsize our lawn and garden distribution operations to reflect business levels for the fiscal year as a result  we have recorded charges of million in the fiscal year ending september  as described below under fiscal compared with fiscal the sale of the solaris business by pharmacia  the expiration of the solaris agreement and termination of the scotts distribution relationship subject our distribution business to significant uncertainties 
these include the resolution of all payments due between us and pharmacia under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from pharmacia for cost reimbursements and payments for cost reductions  the amounts payable to pharmacia for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris sub agents 
scotts and pharmacia have each initiated litigation against central arising out of the prior distribution relationship 
in addition  central has filed suit against scotts and pharmacia seeking damages and injunctive relief as well as restitution for  among other things  breach of contract and violations of the antitrust laws by scotts and pharmacia 
each of these cases is in its early stage 
for this reason and because of the uncertainties inherent in complex litigation  it is not currently possible to make an assessment of the potential impact  losses or gains that may arise out of these cases individually or collectively 
central believes that the reconciliation of all accounts and claims with pharmacia and scotts will not result in additional charges to central 
further  central believes it has substantial counterclaims and rights of offset against both scotts and pharmacia  as well as meritorious defenses  and intends to vigorously contest both suits 
however  central cannot assure you that the resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position and or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative other charges income from operations interest expense  net other income income tax expense net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased by or million to  million from  million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in distribution sales primarily attributable to reduced solaris sales being partially offset by a million increase in garden products sales million attributable to the businesses acquired norcal pottery  acquired in january  unicorn laboratories  acquired in december  and the amdro and image product lines  acquired in march  together with a million increase in pet products sales 
gross profit decreased by million or from million during fiscal to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars was principally related to a million decrease in distribution s gross profit partially offset by a million increase in garden products and pet products gross profit 
as a result of resizing our lawn and garden distribution operations  the carrying value of inventory at the distribution centers to be closed was evaluated to determine what products could be moved to the locations remaining open  how much of it would represent significant overstock and what products would have to be liquidated at the individual distribution centers 
this evaluation resulted in a write down of lawn and garden inventory of million to adjust such inventory to its estimated fair value 
this write down resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold and occupancy of million in fiscal compared with the inventory write down of million recorded in fiscal excluding distribution  gross profit dollars from existing operations increased by million 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of an increase in distribution s gross profit percentage combined with a larger proportion of higher margin branded product sales relative to total sales 
the increased distribution gross profit percentage was primarily the result of the reduction in sales of low margin solaris products principally to retailers distribution centers 
garden products and pet products gross profit percentages remained relatively constant 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million during fiscal to million for fiscal of the million increase  approximately million was attributed to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to for fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
these increases were offset by a decrease from existing operations of million primarily attributable to a million decrease in lawn and garden distribution operations resulting from lower sales  offset by a million increase principally related to pennington as a result of increased coop and media advertising  and expanded use of common freight carriers coupled with increased fuel costs 
facilities expense totaled million in both fiscal and this results from an increase in costs associated with newly acquired businesses of million  offset by a reduction in costs associated with existing operations of million 
the decrease in existing operations related principally to lawn and garden distribution operations resulting from certain facilities which were closed during fiscal warehouse and administrative expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
the increase from existing operations  million  related principally to increases in legal and professional fees of million related to our strategic planning and evaluation process  increases in corporate personnel and related travel of million and million in additional corporate office space costs 
in september  the company recorded million of charges resulting from workforce reductions  employee benefit obligations  facility closures  and asset impairments that were necessary due to the termination of the company s distribution arrangement with the scotts company and other anticipated sales decreases in the distribution business 
these charges were offset by the reversal of million of certain exit related costs recorded in connection with the fiscal restructuring plan for which the company was no longer obligated 
as a result of the fiscal  and anticipated future  sales decreases in the distribution segment  the company initiated a plan to close distribution centers and reduce its workforce which is expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal in connection with this plan  the company recorded a severance charge of million associated with the termination of employees  primarily in the sales force and distribution centers 
severance of million was paid to employees terminated during fiscal  with the balance expected to be paid to employees who will be terminated in fiscal in connection with the facilities closures  million was accrued for estimated lease costs  and million for estimated property tax and facilities maintenance costs  that the company is obligated to pay for periods subsequent to closure 
the company expects to complete the facility closures by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company also recorded an million impairment charge to reduce certain facility assets to their estimated fair value based on an independent appraisal  and an million provision for estimated uncollectible receivables from customers of the closed facilities 
in addition  as a direct result of the termination of the distribution relationship with the scotts company  the company recorded a charge of million as the company became obligated to make cash payments which were guaranteed to certain employees in the event of such termination 
these payments will be paid during fiscal as a result of the events described above  management has reevaluated the recoverability of the intangible assets in the distribution segment 
based on an evaluation of estimated future cash flows associated with affected facilities  the company determined that goodwill and certain trademarks were impaired  and accordingly recorded charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce those assets to estimated fair values 
remaining reserve balances totaling million are included in the consolidated balance sheet within the category accounts payable and accrued expenses comprised of million associated with other charges recorded in the year ended september   million associated with other charges recorded in the year ended september   and million associated with other charges recorded in the year ended september  with respect to each of these amounts the reserve balance of million associated with the fiscal charges was the net result of severance payments of million made to terminated employees  all of which was paid in  exit related and other costs totaling million principally lease payments  of which million was paid in  million was paid in and million paid in  and million of reserves which were reversed in fiscal that were no longer required related to costs associated with these exit activities 
the remainder of the costs associated with this reserve will be incurred in the first quarter of  the reserve balance of million associated with the fiscal charges was the net result of severance payments of million made to terminated employees 
of the million of severance  million was paid in and million was paid in the remaining exit costs associated with this plan will be incurred during fiscal  and the reserve balance of million associated with the fiscal charges is associated with severance payments of million and the exit costs of million which will be paid during fiscal year net interest expense for the year ended september  increased by million to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding short term debt resulting principally from the company s stock repurchase program and the businesses acquired 
during the year ended september   the company repurchased  shares of its stock for a total cost of approximately million  primarily through the use of its revolving credit facility 
average short term borrowings for the year ended september  were million compared with million for the year ended september  the average short term interest rates for the years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
during fiscal the company recognized tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million primarily as the result of non deductible charges  primarily goodwill amortization and impairment charges  recorded during the year 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by or million to  million from  million for fiscal of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to businesses acquired 
of the increase related to our existing business  approximately million was attributable to distribution  million to garden products  offset by a decrease of million attributable to pet products 
gross profit increased by or million from million during fiscal to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal of the million increase in gross profit  approximately million was attributable to our existing businesses 
the million increase included a write down of million related to million reduction in the carrying value of inventory to be returned to solaris to its estimated realizable value  computed based on the difference between the manufacturer s list price for such product and central s carrying value  and million attributable to certain inventory and supplies of our closed facilities which were determined to be economically impractical to use at our other facilities 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is the result of a larger proportion of garden products and pet products sales relative to total sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million from million for fiscal  an increase of 
of the million increase  approximately million related to newly acquired operations 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
the increase from existing operations  million  related principally to million due to increased sales volume  million due to increased store service personnel  and million for expanded use of common freight carriers 
the increase of million was net of million of expenses incurred in fiscal as part of the closure of certain distribution facilities 
facilities expenses increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
the increase from existing operations  million  was primarily attributable to million of costs resulting from expanding our total square footage of warehouse space  principally in our distribution segment 
the million increase was net of million related to costs incurred in fiscal as part of the closure of certain of our distribution facilities 
warehouse and administrative expenses increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
the increase from existing operations  million  was principally related to million due to increased sales volume  including million of additional bad debt expense related to a bankruptcy  million related to product development and packaging design and testing for both pet products and garden products segments  million related to computer conversion costs for certain older systems acquired in acquisitions  and expanded use of data communication lines to link all of our computer systems  million related to increased medical insurance and legal and professional costs  and million increase in amortization of goodwill 
the million increase was net of million related to costs incurred in fiscal as part of the closure of certain of our distribution facilities 
in september  the company recorded other charges totaling million related to the resizing of our distribution operations and costs incurred associated with the expiration of the solaris agreement 
the resizing of our distribution operations was made to reflect the fact that our sales volume of solaris products in fiscal was expected to be reduced from the volume in fiscal by an estimated million 
in order to minimize the impact of this loss of revenue  the company initiated plans to close its distribution centers located in visalia  california  mcalester  oklahoma  and albuquerque  new mexico 
customers primarily serviced by these locations were assigned to other company facilities 
accordingly  the company recorded charges totaling million  which included a million reduction in the carrying value of a building and certain facility assets which would no longer be used and were disposed of during fiscal  million for severance costs associated with a workforce reduction  million for lease costs and million for property taxes and facilities maintenance costs to be paid by the company during the periods subsequent to the termination of operations 
these actions were expected to somewhat mitigate the impact of lost profits associated with the solaris agreement by reducing future selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million annually  partially beginning in fiscal  to keep such costs in line with projected operating levels 
of the remaining million in charges  million related to a reserve established for estimated non collectible amounts due from distributors involved in the solaris program  and related to post closure facility lease obligations of the company s facility which warehoused only inventory received under the solaris agreement which was closed upon the expiration of the agreement 
for the year ended september   the company recorded other charges totaling million 
of these charges  million related to the closure of of the company s distribution centers 
of the million of exit related costs  million related to severance costs associated with a workforce reduction  million to write off certain inventory and supplies which were determined to be economically impractical to use at other company facilities  million for the disposal of improvements and equipment  million for lease costs and million for property taxes and facilities maintenance costs to be paid by the company during the periods subsequent to the termination of operations 
of the distribution centers which were closed  seven were related to distribution s pet supplies business  five in the western us and two in the northeast market 
the closure and consolidation of these distribution centers into other existing distribution centers was principally due to the acquisition of regional pet retailers by two major pet retailers  and in the northeast market the decision by one major retailer to purchase a larger percentage of their products directly from manufacturers into its retail store locations or distribute these products through internal distribution centers 
as a result of these actions  the overall market for the company s pet supplies business in these geographic areas was reduced 
the company believes that the closure of these locations enabled it to serve its customer base more cost effectively 
the closure of two of the company s southern california lawn and garden distribution centers was done in conjunction with the transfer of certain business previously shipped from the company s central california facility 
the operations of these three distribution centers were consolidated into a larger existing facility in southern california 
the company believes that the move has reduced shipping costs within california while at the same time provide better service to its customers 
the remaining distribution centers which were closed related to the company s vegetable seed distribution operation in celaya  mexico  and the consolidation of the pennington seed operation in arkansas into the company s distribution center in arkansas 
the celaya distribution center was part of a larger acquisition made by the company several years ago 
since the sale of vegetable seed has never been part of the company s core business and revenues have remained modest with little growth potential  the company elected to exit this business 
these actions were expected to reduce the impact of lost profits associated with the loss of customers due to the above events by reducing future selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million annually to keep such costs in line with projected operating levels 
these cost reductions were realized beginning in fiscal of the remaining million charge  million relates to costs associated with professional and due diligence expenses principally related to a potential major acquisition that was not completed 
the remaining million relates to package design and product launch costs incurred pursuant to a test program initiated and completed in fiscal which are not expected to recur in future years 
net interest expense for the year ended september  increased by approximately or million to million for million for the year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding short term debt resulting principally from the company s stock repurchase program and the acquisition in january of norcal pottery 
during fiscal  the company repurchased its stock for a total cost of approximately million primarily through the use of its revolving credit facility 
average short term borrowings for fiscal were million compared with million for fiscal the average short term interest rates for the years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
the company s effective income tax rate for was compared with for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate results principally from non deductible goodwill amortization being a higher percentage of taxable income than was the case in fiscal new accounting pronouncements see note  organization and significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of securities to the public 
the company received net proceeds after offering expenses of approximately million from its five public offerings of common stock in july  november  july  august and january in november  the company completed the sale of million subordinated convertible notes generating approximately million net of underwriting commissions 
historically  the company s business has been highly seasonal and its working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
since the company s short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  this quarter is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and consequently the company s ability to borrow is at its lowest 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  principally due to the solaris agreement for the period between october  and september   inventory levels remained relatively constant while accounts receivable peaked and short term borrowings started to decline as cash collections were received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels were at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables were substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the termination of the solaris agreement and the associated reduction in distribution sales as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern is expected to be less significant in the future 
the company s businesses service two broad markets lawn and garden and pet supplies 
the pet supplies businesses basically deal with products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to carry large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  the company s garden distribution business is highly seasonal with approximately of its sales occurring during the fiscal second and third quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products this seasonality requires them to move large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak selling periods 
to encourage distributors to carry large amounts of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
the company generated cash from operating activities of million during fiscal  which declined from million during fiscal  primarily due to the decline in sales volume during the year 
net cash used in investing activities of million resulted from acquisitions of new companies and the acquisition of office and warehouse equipment  including computer hardware and software 
cash generated from financing activities of million consisted principally of net borrowings of million under the company s lines of credit  partially offset by payments of million to reacquire shares of the company s common stock 
the company has a million line of credit with congress financial corporation western 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon a specific asset borrowing base 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus at the company s option  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at september   the company had million of outstanding borrowings  and had million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any acquisition of a business 
in connection with the acquisition of one company in fiscal  the company assumed a million line of credit 
at september   there were million of outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
interest related to this line is based on a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus 
at the company s option 
excluding the potential impact of any adverse consequences associated with legal matters discussed in item legal proceedings  the company believes that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under its lines of credit  and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
as part of its growth strategy  the company has engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and it anticipates it will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  the company may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject the company to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
weather and seasonality historically  the company s sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the markets it serves 
additionally  the company s business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales occurred in the first six months of the calendar year 
substantially all of the company s operating income is typically generated in this period which has historically offset the operating losses incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
as a result of the anticipated reduction in distribution sales as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern is expected to be less significant in the future 
risk factors relating to forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include information regarding future financial results  the estimated effect of the termination of the solaris agreement and future acquisition activity 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
we have separated the risks into four groups 
risks that relate to garden products  
risks that relate to pet products  
risks that relate to distribution  and 
risks that relate to central generally 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
risks relating to garden products adverse weather during the peak gardening season can hurt garden products and our net sales 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the country 
additionally  our business is highly seasonal  with approximately of our sales in fiscal occurring during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
historically  substantially all of our operating income is generated in this period 
an increase in market prices for grains used to produce bird seed and grass seed could have a negative impact on our operating income 
garden products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of garden products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our pennington subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity grains  used to produce bird seed and grass seed 
historically  market prices for commodity grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
for example  a significant rise in the white millet acquisition cost in late and will have a negative impact on profitability of bird feed products in fiscal  although we do not believe this will be a long term problem 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  garden products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or extent of garden products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by garden products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
to protect against changes in market prices  we generally enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
garden products depends on a few customers  including wal mart and lowes  for a significant portion of its net sales 
garden products largest customer is wal mart  which accounted for approximately  and of its net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
garden products second largest customer is lowes  which accounted for approximately  and of its net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between us and wal mart or lowes could cause our net sales and income from operations to decline 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations 
risks relating to pet products pet products depends on a few customers  including petsmart and petco  for a significant portion of its net sales 
pet products largest customer is petco  which accounted for approximately  and of pet products net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
pet products second largest customer is petsmart  which accounted for approximately  and of pet products net sales for fiscal  fiscal and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between pet products and petco or petsmart could have a material adverse effect on pet products business and financial results 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or pet products inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
an increase in market prices for grains could have a negative impact on our operating income 
pet products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of pet products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our kaytee subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity grains 
historically  market prices for commodity grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  pet products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of pet products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by pet products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
to protect against changes in market prices  we generally enter into purchase contracts for grains and bird seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
risks relating to distribution distribution s net sales and operating income are expected to decrease significantly due to the termination of our distribution relationship with scotts 
from october  to september   distribution distributed solaris product nationwide  pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement 
sales of products purchased from solaris  previously our largest supplier  accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal in january  pharmacia sold its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup r herbicide products for consumer use to scotts and entered into a separate  long term  exclusive agreement pursuant to which pharmacia continues to make roundup herbicide products for consumer use and scotts markets the products 
beginning october   scotts began to distribute ortho r and roundup r products through a system that involves a combination of distributors  of which we were the largest  as well as through direct sales by scotts to certain major retailers 
in addition  scotts began to sell miracle gro r directly to certain retailers 
effective september   scotts discontinued its distribution relationship with central 
the affected products included scotts r  ortho r and miracle gro r products and consumer roundup r products manufactured by pharmacia corporation formerly known as monsanto company for which scotts acts as pharmacia s exclusive sales agent 
for central s fiscal year ended september   the revenue attributable to the affected products was approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was estimated to be million based on historical customer profitability 
we expect this loss of gross profit to be partially offset in fiscal with expense reductions 
due to the termination of the scotts distribution relationship  we have taken actions to downsize our lawn and garden distribution operations to reflect business levels for the fiscal year as a result  we have recorded charges of million in the fiscal year ending september  we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce expenses to offset the loss in revenue from the termination of the scotts distribution relationship or that our lawn and garden distribution operations will be able to operate profitably at the reduced revenue levels forecasted for fiscal if our current downsizing efforts are not successful  we may be forced to record additional charges in fiscal  which would decrease our operating results further 
the sale of the solaris business by pharmacia  the expiration of the solaris agreement and termination of the scotts distribution relationship subject our distribution business to significant uncertainties 
these include the resolution of all payments due between us and pharmacia under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from pharmacia for cost reimbursements and payments for cost reductions  the amounts payable to pharmacia for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris sub agents 
scotts and pharmacia have each initiated litigation against central arising out of the prior distribution relationship 
in addition  central has filed suit against scotts and pharmacia seeking damages and injunctive relief as well as restitution for  among other things  breach of contract and violations of the antitrust laws by scotts and pharmacia 
each of these cases is in its early stage 
for this reason and because of the uncertainties inherent in complex litigation  it is not currently possible to make an assessment of the potential impact  losses or gains that may arise out of these cases individually or collectively 
central believes that the reconciliation of all accounts and claims with pharmacia and scotts will not result in additional charges to central 
further  central believes it has substantial counterclaims and rights of offset against both scotts and pharmacia  as well as meritorious defenses  and intends to vigorously contest both suits 
however  central cannot assure you that the resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position and or cash flows 
distribution depends on a few customers  including wal mart and home depot  for a significant portion of its net sales 
distribution s largest customer is wal mart  which accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales for fiscal and for fiscal and distribution s second largest customer is home depot  which accounted for approximately of distribution s net sales for fiscal  for fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal  wal mart began to have certain products delivered to its internal distribution centers rather than directly to stores  which adversely affected our revenue from these products 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  wal mart informed distribution of a number of significant changes in its lawn and garden supplies purchasing programs and procedures for the coming year 
these include wal mart s decision to purchase certain lawn and garden supplies directly from a number of manufacturers whose lawn and garden supplies had previously been sold through distribution  a change from store door deliveries of many of the lawn and garden supplies formerly delivered by distribution to individual wal mart stores to a new procedure whereby distribution will ship these products to wal mart distribution centers  and wal mart s decision not to have central distribution personnel perform lawn and garden supplies merchandising functions inside wal mart stores 
as a result of these factors  and the closing of distribution centers associated with the distribution restructuring  distribution s sales of lawn and garden supplies to wal mart in are expected to decline significantly 
the distribution facility closures coupled with the absence of our distributing scotts products in has also adversely impacted other customer relationships 
the loss of  or further significant adverse change in  the relationship between distribution and wal mart or home depot could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
the majority of our pet supply distribution sales are made to independent pet retailers  whose market share has been eroded by the growth of national specialty pet stores 
historically  a majority of our pet supply distribution sales have been made to independent pet retailers 
in recent years  these independent pet retailers have experienced severe competition from and a loss of market share to national specialty pet retailers  like petsmart and petco  and mass merchants  like wal mart  kmart and target 
in addition  these independent pet retailers are now experiencing competition from internet e retailers 
the future success of our pet supply distribution business will depend on our ability to offer competitive costs and value added services to independent pet dealers and to increase sales to national specialty pet retailers and mass merchants 
if independent pet retailers continue to lose market share to national specialty pet retailers and we are unable to expand our business with these pet retailers  distribution s net sales will decline and our operating income will suffer 
adverse weather during the peak gardening season can hurt distribution s and our net sales 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  distribution s revenue and our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the country 
additionally  distribution s business is highly seasonal  with approximately of its sales in fiscal occurring during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
historically  substantially all of distribution s operating income is generated in this period 
because of intense competition  distribution s product sales generate low margins 
the lawn and garden and pet supply distribution industries in which we operate are characterized by relatively low profit margins 
as a result  distribution s success is highly dependent upon effective cost and management controls and differentiating its services from those of its competitors 
the wholesale lawn and garden and pet supply distribution businesses are highly competitive  with many companies competing principally on the basis of price and service 
in addition to competition from other distributors  distribution also competes with manufacturers and suppliers  like scotts  that elect to distribute certain of their products directly to retailers  including distribution s major customers  and private label product suppliers 
there can be no assurance that distribution will not encounter increased competition in the future or will not lose business from major manufacturers that elect to sell their products directly to retailers  either of which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
risks relating to central generally our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include 
weather conditions and seasonality during peak gardening seasons  
shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  
shifts in demand for pet products  
changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  
the effect of acquisitions  
economic stability of retail customers  
the final resolution of payments due between us and pharmacia under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from pharmacia for cost reimbursements  payments for cost reductions and payments for services  the amounts payable to pharmacia for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris direct sales accounts  and 
the extent of lost business from the termination of our distribution relationship with scotts and our ability to offset the loss of gross profit as a result of the termination through expense reductions and other business growth 
in addition  because our distribution business operates on relatively low margins  our operating results in any quarterly period could be affected significantly by slight variations in revenues or operating costs 
for the same reason  our quarterly results also may be vulnerable to problems in areas such as collectibility of accounts receivable  inventory control and competitive price pressures 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to these variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
our ability to grow will depend upon internal expansion and acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we aggressively pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  adverse short term effects on our operating results  integration of financial reporting systems and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
since  central has completed over acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses or that such businesses will enhance our business 
we have also had preliminary acquisition discussions with  or have evaluated the potential acquisition of  numerous other companies over the last several years 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of a material acquisition being completed in the future 
we may seek to finance any such acquisition through additional debt or equity financings  which could result in dilution and additional risk for the holders of our common stock 
we anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by us will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect us or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business 
our future results of operations will also depend in part on our ability to successfully expand internally by increasing the number of new product lines  and to manage any future growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain or integrate additional product lines or manage any future growth successfully 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief operating officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of pennington 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of the company 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  controls approximately of the voting power of our capital stock and  therefore  can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have approximately of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of the common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price 
the products that we manufacture and distribute may subject us to environmental considerations 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and has strict internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
the products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
we have pending litigation which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are a party to certain legal proceedings including the litigation between us and scotts and pharmacia arising out of disputes regarding the termination of the solaris agreement and potential litigation arising from a fire which destroyed our phoenix  arizona facility 
we are currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of these proceedings 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  they could result in significant diversion of time by our management 
the results of these proceedings  including any potential settlements  are uncertain and we cannot assure you that the outcome of these disputes will not adversely affect our operating results 
for more information on our pending litigation  please see item legal proceedings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk central is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
central does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the interest payable on central s bank lines of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt had been higher than actual rates  interest expense would have increased by approximately million and  for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
in addition  central has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable debt securities  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
except for the interest rate swap agreements discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  central does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
commodity prices 
central is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for grains and grass seed 
to mitigate risk associated with increases in market prices and commodity availability  central enters into contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed purchases 
such contracts are primarily entered into to ensure commodity availability to the company in the future 
as of september   the company had entered into fixed seed purchase commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would result in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  as of september   the company had entered into fixed seed commitments for fiscal totaling approximately million 
a change in the market price for grain and grass seed would have resulted in an additional pretax gain or loss of million related to the contracts outstanding as of september  foreign currency risks 
central has minimal sales outside of the united states and  therefore  has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
purchases made from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars and  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
central does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
