freight and haulage revenues on slr operations in new england decreased  and traffic decreased approximately  carloads  while freight and haulage revenues on pennsylvania rail operations increased  and traffic increased  carloads 
the  carload decrease in slr traffic is attributable to a decrease of approximately paper related carloads resulting from a variety of reasons  including less carloads as a result of the closing of a paper mill which was subsequently sold and reopened and problems associated with ns s and csxt s implementation of the conrail merger  approximately  carloads of one time shipments of pipe and cement last year that did not recur or did not recur at the same volume levels this year  and a decrease of fuel oil carloads for a customer that converted from oil to natural gas

freight and haulage revenues for pennsylvania rail operations increased  and traffic handled increased  carloads  despite being adversely impacted by the congestion and service disruptions caused by ns s and csxt s implementation of the conrail merger

the decrease in average revenues per carload is attributable to slq  which has an average freight rate that is lower than the company s other rail operations since a large percentage of slq s business is overhead traffic from cn to slr  and since pricing for this business reflects the operating synergies between slr and slq 
excluding revenues generated by slq  average revenues per carload increased as a result of mix of business and price adjustments
