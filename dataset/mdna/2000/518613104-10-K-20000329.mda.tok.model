the company has determined the life for amortizing goodwill based upon several factors  the most significant of which are the relative size  historical financial viability and growth trends of the acquired companies and the relative lengths of time such companies have been in existence 
the company amortizes goodwill on a straight line basis over periods of to years based upon the specific acquisition 
management periodically reviews the company s carrying value and recoverability of unamortized goodwill 
if the facts and circumstances suggest that goodwill may be impaired  the carrying value of such goodwill will be adjusted which will result in an immediate charge against income during the period of the adjustment and or the length of the remaining amortization period may be shortened  which will result in an increase in the amount of goodwill amortization during the period of adjustment and each period thereafter until fully amortized 
once adjusted  there can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment and recoverability in future periods 
of the various factors considered by management of the company in determining whether goodwill is impaired  the most significant are i losses from operations  ii loss of customers  and iii industry developments  including the company s inability to maintain its market share  development of competitive products or services  and imposition of additional regulatory requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instruments 
the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and investments in available for sale securities 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments  but exposure to market risks is managed through its regular operating and financing activities 
foreign currency risk the company derives approximately of its revenues from continuing operations from customers outside of the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries  generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize the company s exchange rate exposure to operating margins 
a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies should not materially adversely affect expected earnings or cash flows 
the company generally views its investment in the majority of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the functional currencies of these foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro based currencies 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a depreciation in year end functional currencies relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a million decrease in consolidated stockholders equity and comprehensive income 
interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due to the short term nature of the company s portfolio 
the company s long term revolving credit facility bears interest at variable rates  and the fair value of this instrument is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december  debt levels  basis points increase in interest rates would reduce annual pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million 
investment risk the company s investment portfolio is primarily exposed to risks arising from changes in equity prices 
the company is exposed to equity price risks on equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally small capitalization stocks in the internet segment of the educational services industry 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities and comprehensive income 
the company s investment portfolio includes a number of holdings in non publicly traded companies in the educational services industry 
the company values these investments at either cost less impairment if any or under the equity method of accounting 
equity method investors are specifically excluded from the scope of this disclosure 
non public investments where the company owns less than a stake are subject to fluctuations in market value  but their current illiquidity reduces the exposure to pure market risk 
all the potential impacts noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
