during the year ended december   the company reduced its portfolio by approximately million of mortgage assets  at a loss of approximately million 
as of december   based upon available for sale accounting treatment  the company s net asset value per share was per share 
the net asset value as of such date reflects sales of mortgage assets completed through december  mariner  on behalf of the company  determines net asset value based on valuations and other information obtained through multiple independent dealer quotes 
as of december   the company estimates that its portfolio was comprised of approximately million of agency certificates  million of subordinate interests  million of ios  million of mortgage loans and million of other fixed income assets 
on november   the company announced that its board of directors authorized management to conduct a competitive sale of its less liquid portfolio assets as part of its ongoing program to reduce the volatility of the company s assets 
as of february   the company has approximately million based on december  estimated fair value of these assets remaining to be sold

losses from investment activities 
for the year ended december   the company realized a loss of million or per weighted average share  as a result of losses incurred in sales of securities and early terminations of long term repurchase agreements 
for the year ended december   the company realized a loss of million or per weighted average share  as a result of losses incurred in sales of securities and terminations of interest rate swaps and a reduction in income from its mortgage securities due to a reduced investment portfolio and increasing prepayments 
in response to a difficult credit environment  the company raised cash by selling portfolio securities to meet increased margin requirements 
losses from impairment charges 
for the year ended december   the company treated its portfolio of adjustable rate ios as impaired assets and taken an impairment charge against operating of million or per weighted average share 
at the end of the second and third quarters of  in light of the continued flat yield curve  low levels of libor and faster than expected prepayment rates over an extended period of time  the company decided that the impairment in market value was a permanent impairment 
accordingly  in the second and third quarters of  the company decided that an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  should be realized in current income 
during the year ended december  no additional impairment charges were taken 
most of the company s ios were libor based floating rate ios purchased in december they were acquired to balance duration in the company s portfolio 
this investment was made based on the company s evaluation of the then current prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and the relative values of similar investments 
in evaluating the impairment charge on the ios  the company employs current estimates of future prepayments obtained from independent sources 
for ios collateralized by fixed rate pass through mortgage securities issued by fnma  gnma and fhlmc collectively  agency fixed rate pass throughs  the company utilized the median lifetime projection prepayment speeds compiled and reported by bloomberg lp from a survey of leading dealers in the mortgage market 
for private label ios collateralized by non government agency mortgage securities  the company employs prepayment estimates from at least one independent dealer 
the prepayment estimates typically take into consideration the current level and shape of the yield curve 
as a result of the substantial decline in interest rates since the purchase of the ios  current estimates of prepayment speeds significantly exceed the original prepayment speed estimates 
at the end of the first quarter of  the majority of the company s ios were floating rate ios 
floating rate ios are unique securities in that the interest payments on these securities increase as one month libor increases 
due to this characteristic of option value  floating rate ios trade at much lower yields than fixed rate ios 
at the end of the second and third quarter of  in light of the continued flat yield curve  low levels of libor and faster than expected prepayment rates actually occurring for an extended period of time  the company decided that the impairment in market value was other than temporary 
taxable income loss and gaap income loss for the years ended december  and  a net operating loss as calculated for tax purposes nol is estimated at approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  per weighted average share 
nols generally may be carried forward for years 
the company believes that during it experienced an ownership change within the meaning of section of the code 
consequently  its use of nols generated before the ownership change to reduce taxable income after the ownership change will be subject to limitations under section generally  the use of nols in any year is limited to the value of the company s stock on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate published by the irs with respect to that date 
the company currently is attempting to determine the amount of the annual limitation 
taxable income loss requires an annual calculation  consequently  for the year ended december   taxable income loss may be different from gaap income loss as a result of differing treatment of unrealized gains and losses on securities transactions 
for the company s tax purposes  unrealized gains losses will be recognized at the end of the year and will be aggregated with operating gains losses to produce total taxable income loss for the year 
for the year ended december   the company had unrealized gains of approximately  taxable income and gaap income loss could also differ for other reasons 
for example  the company may take credit provisions which would affect gaap income whereas only actual credit losses are deducted in calculating taxable income 
in addition  g a expenses may differ due to differing treatment of leasehold amortization  certain stock option expenses and other items 
as of december  and  the company had not taken credit provisions because and  respectively  of the company s investments were agency certificates 
the distinction between taxable income and gaap income loss is important to the company s stockholders because dividends or distributions are declared on the basis of taxable income 
while the company does not pay taxes so long as it satisfies the requirements for exemption from taxation pursuant to the reit provisions of the code  each year the company completes a corporate tax form wherein taxable income is calculated as if the company were to be taxed 
this taxable income level helps to determine the amount of dividends the company intends to pay out over time

interest expense is calculated in the same manner for tax and gaap purposes 
the company expects that changes in the company s cost of funds closely correlate with changes in one month libor  although the company may choose to extend the maturity of its liabilities at any time  subject to the lender s consent 
the company s average cost of funds was above one month libor for the year ended december  compared to above one month libor for the year ended december  the company generally has structured its borrowings to adjust with one month libor

for the year ended december    


during  events in the financial markets including the continued flat yield curve  the dislocation in the market for fixed income securities  the tightening of credit available for investment in securities and the increased risk of interest rate sensitive prepayment on mortgages had an adverse effect upon the company s earnings 
a relatively flat yield curve caused financing costs to be relatively high compared to the income earned on the company s mortgage assets 
the dislocation in the fixed income securities market and the increased risk of prepayments  which affected the value of the company s portfolio  together with the tightening of credit available for investment in securities  adversely affected the company s ability to employ leverage profitably 
interest rate swaps in december  the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  million 
the company used these interest rate swaps to hedge its available for sale portfolio of fixed rate agency certificates 
the primary objective of this hedging strategy was to change the interest rate characteristics of these securities from fixed to variable rates  to better correspond to the maturity and repricing characteristics of the short term repurchase agreements used by the company to fund these investments 
this primary objective was the basis for the company s hedge accounting treatment 
the company continually monitored the swaps to ensure that they were effective at changing the interest rate characteristics of the securities 
a secondary objective was to offset fluctuations in the fair value of the securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
in september  the company experienced margin calls and believed it prudent to increase its liquidity  and therefore  liquidated a large portion of its agency certificates 
in conjunction with liquidating these securities positions  the company also discontinued hedge accounting for the related swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company recognized the unrealized loss on these swaps as an element of the overall loss on the liquidation of the securities of million 
in october  the company liquidated agency certificates in response to continued margin calls and the need for liquidity 
the overall october loss on the liquidation of agency certificates  including losses recognized upon suspension of hedge accounting for the remaining swap with a notional amount of million  totaled million 
on the day of each suspension of hedge accounting  the affected swaps were closed out without additional gain or loss 
the company did not enter into any interest rate swaps during the year ended december   after having used them extensively in and the valuations and other information used by the company to monitor the effectiveness of its interest rate swap hedging strategy were obtained through multiple independent dealer quotes 
this same information was used to record the investments and swaps in the company s financial statements and to determine the company s net asset value 
the company has never purchased or written options to enter into swaps 
as part of the company s investigation of the potential impact of the pricing irregularities discovered at the affiliated funds  the company reviewed the pricing of its own securities and swaps and concluded that the valuations used were accurate 
the company has been concerned about the potential distortion of gaap income relative to taxable income caused by differences in the book and tax accounting treatment for its hedging activities and about volatility in reported earnings that would obscure the comparability of the company with other mortgage reits 
at the time of the company s initial public offering  the company believed that some of these concerns would best be addressed by electing to classify the mortgage securities as trading securities for financial statement purposes 
upon further analysis  including analysis of the accounting for the related borrowings  the company concluded that this accounting election would not achieve the results initially anticipated and that classifying the mortgage securities as available for sale would likely result in closer conformity to the tax accounting method upon which distributions are based and greater comparability with other mortgage reits 
therefore  as the company purchased the individual securities in its portfolio of mortgage securities  it did not classify them as trading securities 
because the mortgage assets were not voluntarily classified as trading securities  they met the definition of available for sale securities of paragraph b of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 

accordingly  the company classified each mortgage security as available for sale at its acquisition date and subsequently reported each security at its fair value 
pursuant to paragraph of sfas no 
 unrealized holding gains of million related to available for sale mortgage securities were reported in other comprehensive income at december  following the initial acquisition of most of the securities 
net interest income net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  net interest rate spread  which equals the yield on the company s interest earning assets excluding cash less the average cost of funds for the period was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was because the company s substantially reduced investment portfolio 
the net interest rate spread increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  because of the mix of mortgage assets in the company s investment portfolio  which contained a greater percentage of less liquid securities which finance at higher spreads for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows interest income by earning asset type  average earning assets by type  total interest income  interest expense  average repurchase agreements  average cost of funds  and net interest income for the years ended december  and net interest income dollars in thousands yield on average interest net income average average amortized interest average income on total interest balance of average net cost of income on cash cash contractual interest earning repurchase interest cost of interest investment investments equivalents equivalents commitments income assets agreements expense funds income for the year ended december          for the year ended december           credit considerations the company has not experienced credit losses on its investment portfolio to date  but losses may be experienced in the future

similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates decrease over the life of such mortgage securities  all other factors being equal  the company s net interest income should increase during the life of such mortgage securities as the company will amortize its net premium balance over a longer time

these borrowings appear on the balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
substantially all of the company s investments are currently accepted as collateral for such borrowings 
the company has not established  and currently does not intend to establish  permanent lines of credit 
the company has obtained  and believes it will be able to continue to obtain  short term financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s financing objectives 
at december  and  the company had borrowings outstanding from two lenders and eight lenders  respectively 
such borrowings are generally short term day or day terms and may not be renewed by the lender at its discretion 
certain lenders have reduced the funds made available to the company for pledges of certain less liquid securities 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of the company s borrowings has ranged from one to five years  with a weighted average remaining maturity of days at december  compared to years at december  at december   the company had outstanding million of repurchase agreements 
all of the company s borrowings have a cost of funds which adjusts periodically based on a fixed spread over or under one month libor 
at december  and  the weighted average cost of funds for all of the company s borrowings was 
at december   investments actually pledged had an estimated fair value of million compared to million at december  liquidity liquidity  which is the company s ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows the company to purchase additional securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for the company include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity varies over time as the market value of the company s securities varies 
the company s balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should the company s needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  management believes that the company s securities could in most circumstances be sold to raise cash  however  if the company is forced to liquidate mortgage assets that qualify as qualified real estate assets to repay borrowings  there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its reit status 
the availability of financing for the company s portfolio was stable during this is in sharp contrast to the third and fourth quarters of  which saw a significant decline in the availability of financing 
while financing is not as easily available as it was in early  the company believes it can adequately finance its portfolio given current market conditions 
during  events in the financial markets including the dislocation in the market for fixed income securities  the tightening of credit available for investment in securities and the decrease in value of mortgage securities due to prepayment risk had an adverse effect on the company s ability to borrow funds and may continue to have such effect 
to address concerns with respect to possible decreased liquidity  the company has delevered its portfolio and sold securities 
from october  through december   the company sold approximately billion of mortgage assets  including approximately billion of agency certificates 
in november  the board of directors increased the amount of common stock authorized to be repurchased under the company s stock repurchase program to million 
pursuant to the repurchase program  for the year ended december   the company has used the proceeds of sales of  and payments from  its portfolio securities to repurchase  shares of common stock for million in open market transactions 
such purchases were made at a weighted average price per share of excluding commission costs 
the repurchased shares have been returned to the company s authorized but unissued shares of common stock as treasury shares 
stockholders equity the company uses available for sale treatment for its securities  these assets are carried on the balance sheet at estimated market value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon such available for sale treatment  the company s equity base at december  was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  at december  if the company had used historical amortized cost accounting  the company s equity base at december  would have been million  or per share compared to million  or per share  at december  with the company s available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact gaap net income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the assets and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss and in the statement of operations under other comprehensive loss 
by accounting for its assets in this manner  the company hopes to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  the book value and book value per share of the company are likely to fluctuate far more than if the company used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparison with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may be misleading 
unrealized changes in the estimated net market value of securities have one direct effect on the company s potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase the company s equity base and allow the company to increase its borrowing capacity while negative changes in the net market value of the company s securities might impair the company s liquidity position  requiring the company to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss was million  or of the amortized cost of securities at december  and was million  or of the amortized cost of securities at december  the table below shows the company s equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december  and the historical cost equity basis is influenced by issuances of common stock  the level of gaap earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors

at december   the company s equity to assets ratio was  and ranged from a high of to a low of during initially  the company financed its acquisition of mortgage assets through proceeds of its initial public offering in december and several concurrent private placements  and subsequently financed any acquisitions primarily by borrowing against or leveraging its existing portfolio and using the proceeds to acquire additional mortgage assets 
the company s target for its equity to assets ratio depends on market conditions and other relevant factors 
the equity to assets ratio is total stockholders equity as a percentage of total assets 
the company s total stockholders equity  for purposes of this calculation  equals the company s stockholders equity determined in accordance with gaap 
for purposes of calculating the equity to assets ratio  the company s total assets include the value of the company s investment portfolio on a marked to market basis 
for purchased mortgage assets  the company obtains market quotes for its mortgage assets from independent broker dealers that make markets in securities similar to those in the company s portfolio 
the board of directors has discretion to deviate from or change the company s indebtedness policy at any time 
however  the company endeavors to maintain an adequate capital base to protect against interest rate environments in which the company s financing and hedging costs might exceed interest income from its mortgage assets 
these conditions could occur  for example  when  due to interest rate fluctuations  interest income on the company s mortgage assets which occur during periods  such as the first three quarters of  of rapidly rising interest rates or during periods when the mortgage loans in the portfolio are prepaying rapidly lags behind interest rate increases in the company s variable rate borrowings 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates are expected to influence the company s performance more directly than inflation 
while changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates  interest rates ordinarily increase during periods of high or increasing inflation and decrease during periods of low or declining inflation 
accordingly  management believes that the company s financial condition or results of operations will be influenced by inflation to the extent interest rates are affected by inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the company s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect  among other things  the value of the company s mortgage securities and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and  indeed  that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
as described previously  the company has experienced significant losses as a result of its hedging activities 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net portfolio value as of december  should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net portfolio value is defined as interest earning assets net of interest bearing liabilities 
all changes in value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
december  projected percentage change in change in interest rate net portfolio value basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
the company s objective is to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category
