and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
our revenues are generated primarily from operating company owned restaurants and restaurant franchising under the nathan s  kenny rogers and miami subs brands  licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets and selling products under nathan s branded product program 
the branded product program enables foodservice operators to offer nathans hot dogs and other proprietary items for sale within their facilities 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathans trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods

of the total increase  sales increased by  as a result of the acquisitions made this year 
company owned restaurant sales of the nathan s brand decreased or  to  from  this restaurant sales decline is primarily due to the impact of franchising three company owned restaurants and closing three other unprofitable company owned restaurants during the current fiscal year and closing two company owned units during the prior fiscal year due to the lease expirations 
the total sales decline during the fiscal period attributable to these stores was  comparable restaurant sales of the nathan s brand increased by versus the fiscal period

license royalties were  in the fiscal period as compared to  in the fiscal period 
increases in license royalties resulting from the acquisitions made during the fiscal period were  the majority of the remaining increase is attributable to sales by smg  inc  our licensee for the sale of nathan s frankfurters within supermarkets and club stores

the decrease  as a percentage of restaurant sales  is due partly to the increase in the amount of the average check over the prior period and lower costs of food and labor as a percentage of restaurant sales during the fiscal period

at march   marketable securities and investment in limited partnership totalled  and the working capital deficit was  at march  cash provided by operations of  in the fiscal period is primarily attributable to net loss of  non cash charges of  including depreciation and amortization of  impairment charges on notes receivable and long lived assets of  allowance for doubtful accounts of  equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate of  and loss on disposal of fixed assets of  other changes within the operating accounts  net of the assets and liabilities purchased in the merger  were decreases in marketable investment securities of  an increase in notes and accounts receivables of  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  a decrease in other assets of  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  a decrease in other noncurrent liabilities of  and an increase in deferred franchise fees and other revenue of  cash provided by investing activities of  includes cash acquired in connection with the miami subs merger of  net of acquisition costs and payments received on notes receivable of  cash used in investing activities was  for the acquisition of the intellectual property of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system  including expenses and  primarily relating to our acquisition of two kenny rogers roasters restaurants and capital improvements of company owned restaurants and other fixed asset additions 
we plan to invest approximately  renovating the two recently acquired kenny rogers roasters restaurants 
cash used in financing activities of  represents repayments of assumed miami subs notes payable and capitalized lease obligations 
we anticipate that we may further reduce the amount of miami subs notes payable in the future 
in connection with the acquisition of miami subs  we are in the process of closing up to underperforming miami subs restaurants 
accordingly  we expect to incur future cash payments  consisting primarily of future lease payments including costs and expenses associated with terminating such leases 
at present we have accrued  of lease termination costs  however  we are unable to reasonably estimate these final costs 
at march   the minimum annual lease payments for the affected stores where no termination cost has been accrued was  with remaining lease terms ranging from years up to approximately years 
we expect that we will reinvest in certain existing restaurants in the future and that we will fund those investments from our operating cash flow 
we do not currently expect to incur significant capital expenditures to develop new company owned restaurants  which would require debt or equity financing 
although we had a working capital deficit of  at march   we believe that available cash  marketable securities and investment in limited partnership and internally generated funds should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations through fiscal we maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have not borrowed any funds to date under this line of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  sales and earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in our marketplace for our company owned nathan s stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
miami subs restaurant sales have historically been strongest the period march through august  which approximates our first and second quarters  as a result of a heavy concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
as a result  we believe that future revenues may become slightly more seasonal 
impact of inflation during the past several years our commodity costs have remained relatively stable 
as such  we believe that inflation has not materially impacted earnings 
substantial increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry 
in  legislation was enacted which increased the federal minimum wage  from per hour to on october  with another increase to on september  we experienced higher labor costs on a relatively small proportion of our workforce as a result of the september increase 
currently  various legislators are re examining additional changes to the minimum wage requirements 
at this time  different bills have been passed by the senate and the house of representatives proposing to further increase the federal minimum wage  which is expected to go to conference during the summer we believe that any further increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on us and we might have to reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset any legislated increase to avoid reducing operating margins

forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements represent our judgment regarding future events 
although we would not make forward looking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so  we cannot guarantee their accuracy and actual results may differ materially from those we anticipated due to a number of uncertainties  many of which we are not aware 
these risks and uncertainties  many of which are not within our control  include  but are not limited to economic  weather  legislative and business conditions  the availability of suitable restaurant sites on reasonable rental terms  changes in consumer tastes  ability to continue to attract franchisees  the ability to purchase its primary food and paper products at reasonable prices  no material increases in the minimum wage  and our ability to attract competent restaurant and managerial personnel 
we generally identify forward looking statements with the words believe  intend  plan  expect  anticipate  estimate  will  should and similar expressions 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time or reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments and a highly liquid investment limited partnership that invests principally in equities 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and the performance of the equity markets 
the interest rate on our borrowings are generally determined based upon prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in  united states dollars  reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have not purchased future contracts  options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies
